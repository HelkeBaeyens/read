 Abstract 
 The paper (asks lots of questions about/tries to find the truth about) the linkages between (related to computers and science) change and production risk, with an use to corn. The 
 effects of technology on risk exposure are carefully studied. We define (related to computers and science) progress to be risk-increasing (risk-decreasing) 
 if it increases (decreases) the relative risk higher cost. The analysis is applied to panel data from Wisconsin research stations. 
 (may or may not happen, depending on something) moments (including mean, variance and skewness) of corn yield, grain moisture and corn (money made/good thing received) are guessed for 
 different places/locations. We (ask lots of questions about/try to find the truth about) how the trade-off between expected return and the risk higher cost differs/changes over time and over space. 
 The scientific results point to/show that (related to computers and science) progress adds/gives to reducing the exposure to risk as well as bad thing risk 
 in corn production, although this effect differs/changes across places/locations. They also stress the role of the relative maturity of corn combinations as 
 a means of managing risk.

 1. Introduction 
 
 (related to computers and science) change has added/has given to large increases in farming-based working well (e.g. Ball et al., 
 1979; Brennan, 1984; Master et al., 1998; Byerlee, 
 1996). Besides improving working well, (related to computers and science) 
 change has also affected production risk (e.g. Antle 
 and Crissman, 1990; Binswanger and Barah, 1980). 
 While (related to tiny chemical assembly instructions inside of living things) improvements have increased mean

 crop yields, they have also affected yield (quality of changing over time or at different places). 
 For example, while the green revolution created 
 increases in both mean and variance of yield, Traxler 
 et al. (1995) found that the after-green revolution time 
 showed both slower mean yield growth and (lowering in number/getting worse) yield risk. This latter effect can be attributed in 
 part to (related to tiny chemical assembly instructions inside of living things) improvements targeted to improved 
 pest and disease resistance. 
 Interest in risk issues (is given a reason to do something) by the scientific 
 (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) that most farmers are risk disliking (e.g. Lin 
 et al., 1974; Binswanger, 1981; Antle, 1987; Saha 
 et al., 1994). This hints that (related to computers and science) change 
 can also create benefits by reducing the farmers' 
 exposure to production risk. Also, the scientific 
 (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) points to/shows that most farmers show decreasing total risk disgust (e.g. Binswanger, 1981; 
 Chavas and Holt, 1996). This hints that farmers

 hate 'downside risk' (Antle, 1987). Obviously, this means that farmers are especially 
 afraid of being exposed to unexpectedly low returns. 
 This (has given a reason to do something) research on the role of bad thing risk in risk management, including the 'safety 
 first' approach (e.g. Roumasset, 1976). Much research has carefully studied farming-based risk, including the 
 mean-variance (act of asking questions and trying to find the truth about something) of input effects (e.g. Just 
 and Pope, 1997) and technology (e.g. Traxler et al., 
 1995). Yet, the influence of (related to computers and science) change on 
 bad thing risk exposure (e.g. on the chance of 
 crop failure) remains poorly understood. There is a 
 need to clean/make better our understanding of the linkages between (related to computers and science) change and exposure to risk and 
 bad thing risk in farming, with effects/results/suggestions for the 
 cost of private risk bearing. 
 This study presents an money-based analysis of risk 
 exposure in corn production and corn a money-making state at 
 the edge of the Corn Belt. Following Antle (1983) 
 and Antle and Goodger (1984), our analysis of production risk involves a moment-based approach. We 
 extend the mean-variance analysis presented in Just 
 and Pope (1997) and Traxler et al. (1995) by also 
 examining the third central moment of the (connected/related) 
 random (numbers that change/things that change). Under risk disgust, decision makers are negatively/badly affected by a higher variance of returns. And under bad thing risk disgust, the welfare 
 of decision makers is positively (negatively) affected 
 by an increase (decrease) in skewness of returns. This 
 paper examines the effects of (related to computers and science) change 
 on the mean, variance and skewness of corn produce and 
 corn a money-making state, as they change under (related to computers and science) 
 progress. Depending on Pratt's (1964) risk higher cost 
 as a measure of the cost of private risk bearing, we 
 define (related to computers and science) progress to be risk-increasing 
 (risk-decreasing) if it increases (decreases) the relative 
 risk higher cost. We (ask lots of questions about/try to find the truth about) scientifically the trade-off 
 between risk, measured by both second and third central moments, and expected (money made/good thing received), with a special focus 
 on the degree of farmers' exposure to bad thing risk. 
 The analysis is applied to corn produce and corn 
 a money-making state using time series data (1974-1997) from 
 a few research stations in Wisconsin. The panel 
 structure of the data enables us to (ask lots of questions about/try to find the truth about) the 
 effects/results/suggestions of risk (including bad thing risk) connected with corn a money-making state on farmers' welfare over 
 time and across space. Econometric guesses are 
 received/got for the first three moments of the distribu- 
 
 tion of corn yield, corn moisture and corn (money made/good thing received). The 
 evidence shows how the trade-off between 
 expected return and risk has changed over time and 
 across places/locations. Our results point to/show that (related to computers and science) 
 progress has added/has given to reducing risk exposure, 
 although such effects change/differ  across space. They also 
 stress the importance of relative maturity of corn combinations as a means of managing production risk. Finally, 
 they document the role and (change over time) of bad thing 
 risk exposure, and its effects/results/suggestions for the cost of 
 risk. 
 This paper is organized as follows. Section 3 
 presents a idea-based (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) of decision-making 
 under risk. Under the expected utility model, we 
 carefully study the effects of technology and input use on 
 production risk and a money-making state. We use the properties of the relative risk high-quality to show the 
 effects of technology on risk exposure. As discussed 
 in Section 4, we depend on a moment-based approach to 
 come close to the risk higher cost. This guides our econometric (detailed description of exactly what is required) for scientific research shown in 
 Section 5. The data and application of the model to 
 corn are discussed in Section 6. Sections 7 and 8 
 present the scientific analysis. We carefully study how the 
 choice of corn combination maturity affects corn produce and 
 corn a money-making state, focusing on its effects on expected 
 value, variance as well as skewness. Corn combination maturity is found to have (meaningful numbers) effects 
 on production risk. This hints that the choice of 
 combination maturity is an important risk management tool 
 for farmers. We also find (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) that (related to computers and science) 
 change adds/gives to a big reduction in risk 
 exposure through its effects on the variance as well 
 as skewness of (money made/good thing received). In other words, besides increasing yield, (related to computers and science) progress also lower farmers' 
 exposure to both risk and bad thing risk. However, 
 these effects are found to change/differ  between farm types 
 and across space. Finally, ending/deciding statements are 
 presented in Section 9. 
 
 2. Idea-based (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) 
 Think about/believe a farm producing Y = (Y1, Y2, ... , Y17 ), 
 a vector of outputs under doubt. Under technology t, farm production of output Yi is represented by 
 the (random/including random data points) functions Yi = A; Â· y;(x;, t, e), where 
 Ai is the land of the ith valuable thing, y;(x;, t, e) is 
 
 K. Kim, J.-P. Chavas/Agricultural Money flow 29 (2003) 125-142 
 
 the similar production per area of land, xi is a vector 
 of inputs used to produce y;, and e is a vector of 
 (random/including random data points) factors that are not known to the decision 
 maker at the time when the input decisions are made. 
 The vector of (random/including random data points) factors e is treated as a random (number or thing that changes) with a given chance distribution G. 
 The vector e includes unpredictable weather effects 
 as well as the effects of pest and sicknesses on farm 
 production. (in almost the same way), under technology t, farm production cost in producing the ith valuable thing is represented by the (random/including random data points) function (A; Â· C;(x;, t, e)), 
 where C;(x;, t, e) is the cost per area of land, depending of 
 input choices x;, technology t, and production doubt e. Note that this allows cost to depend directly 
 on yield, e.g. C; = c;(y;(x;, t, e), x;, t, e). Examples 
 of ex-post costs that change/differ  with output include storage 
 cost and drying cost. By representing p; the price of output Y;, total (money made/good thing received) connected with farm activities Y is:

 changeable n by its expected value E(n). It is a money-based 
 measure of the understood cost of private risk bearing. 
 In this big picture, for non-fall apart/become sick risk, risk disgust 
 hints that R &amp;gt; 0, (in other words) that the decision maker always prefers a riskless world. This goes along with a 
 curved utility function: a2 u I an 2 &amp;lt; 0 (Pratt, 1964 ). 
 From Eq. (2), making the most of expected utility is 
 equal to making the most of the sure feeling equal, 
 E[n(x, t, Â·)]- R(x, t). In general, the sure feeling equal, E[n(x, t, Â·)]- R(x, t), depends on input use x 
 and technology t. Of particular interest are the effects 
 of input use x and technology t on risk exposure. An 
 input x is said to be risk-increasing (risk-decreasing) 
 if aR(x, t) jax &amp;gt; 0 ( &amp;lt;0), (in other words) if it increases (decreases) 
 the cost of private risk bearing (e.g. Ramaswami, 
 1992). Assuming an interior solution, and using the 
 first-order necessary condition a[E(n) - R]jax = 0, 
 this can be expressed equally through the effects 
 on the relative risk high-quality: R(x, t) j[E(n(x, t, Â·)) R(x, t)]_). In other words, at the best, input x is 
 risk-increasing (risk-decreasing) if it tends to increase 
 (decrease) the relative risk higher cost:

 where A represents total land available for farm production. The price of output, Pi, can also introduce 
 a (random/including random data points) market (surrounding conditions) in the analysis. This 
 allows for price and weather doubt, as well as 
 technology effects in production decisions. Assume 
 that inputs are chosen to (make as big as possible) the expect utility 
 of (money made/good thing received) EU(n), where E is the expectation operator 
 based on the information available at the time decisions are made. The von Neumann-Morgenstern 
 utility function U(n) represents the risk preferences 
 of the decision maker, with auI an &amp;gt; 0. Then, we can 
 describe farm decision-making by the optimization problem: MaxEU{(n)}, where profit n is given 
 in Eq. (1). The cost of private risk bearing can be 
 measured by the sure amount R happiness-causing: 
 EU(n)

 where [E(n) - R] is the sure feeling equal of (money made/good thing received) 
 (Pratt, 1964). The valueR defined in Eq. (2) is the risk 
 higher cost measuring the largest amount of money the 
 decision maker is willing to pay to replace the random 
 
 In a almost the same  fashion, we propose to (ask lots of questions about/try to find the truth about) the 
 effects 9f (related to computers and science) change on risk exposure. We 
 think about/believe the case of (related to computers and science) progress connected

 exposure depends on risk preferences as they influence the cost of private risk bearing R. This suggests 
 a need to test the risk high-quality R.

 3. Scientific putting into use 
 While R can always be gotten as an understood 
 solution to Eq. (2), this needs/demands knowing both the 
 utility function U(rr) and the chance distribution 
 of n:. Getting such scientific information can be 
 challenging. Two options are available: (1) get 
 parametric guesses of the chance function of 
 n:; or (2) guess the moments of n. The first option involves specifying a functional form for the 
 chance function and guessing it by the maximum chance method. The choice of functional 
 form includes standard distributions (such as (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy), 
 beta, gamma) as well as changes of standard distributions. A few changes have been 
 applied in the books, including the inverse exaggerated sin (e.g. Moss and Shonkwiler, 1993; Ramirez, 
 1997) and the exaggerated unrelated topic (e.g. Taylor, 1984; 
 Ramaswami, 1992). One problem with these approaches is that choosing the functional form is not 
 always obvious. On the one hand, if one knew the 
 functional form for sure, then maximum chance 
 guess would provide consistent and asymptotically (producing a lot with very little waste) limit/guideline guesses. On the other hand, 
 if the functional form is not the 'true one', then the 
 model would be mis-specified creating (not agreeing/not happening in the same way) 
 limit/guideline guesses. Given that we often have weak a 
 priori information about the true shape of a chance function, the issue of mis-(detailed description of exactly what is required) bias can be 
 important. 
 One different approach is to go ahead by guessing the moments of the random changeable n:. There has 
 been much scientific research focusing on guessing 
 the first two central moments: the mean and the variance. Situations in which production decisions affect 
 risk exposure suggest heteroscedasticity as the variance 
 of (money made/good thing received) is expected to change/differ  with input choice. A common approach has been to use the Just-Pope (detailed description of exactly what is required) for guessing the first two moments (e.g. Just and 
 Pope, 1997; Traxler et al., 1995). However, it is possible to go beyond a mean-variance analysis. As shown 
 by Antle (1983, 1987) and Antle and Goodger (1984), 
 consistent guesses of all (connected/related) central moments 
 can be gotten econometrically. This allows the (act of asking questions and trying to find the truth about something) of the mean, variance as well as higher 
 moments (e.g. the skewness connected with bad thing 
 risk exposure). This is the approach we follow in this 
 paper. 
 
 Once the riskiness of profit n: is tested, understanding its effects/results/suggestions for the cost of private risk 
 bearing needs/demands information about risk preferences. 
 Using a moment based-approach, it will be convenient 
 to depend on an guess to the risk high-quality R. 
 Under differentiability, take a first-order Taylor series 
 (act of something getting bigger, wider, etc.) on the right-hand side of Eq. (2) with respect to R, and a mth order Taylor series (act of something getting bigger, wider, etc.) 
 on the left-hand side of Eq. (2) with respect to n:. As 
 shown by Antle (1987), this gives the following guess to the risk high-quality R: 
 1 [_( -&#126;-Â·E[n:-E(n:)]l 
 m uJ 
 Â·] 
 R&#126;-Â·

 where u 1 = (aiu;an:i)(E(n:)) is the jth derivative 
 of U with respect to (make money/get something good) rr, tested at E(n:), j = 
 1, ... , m, m :::: 2. Note that E[n:- E(n:)]i is the jth 
 central moment of n:. So, expression (3) provides an 
 (pretty close) measure of the risk higher cost as a function of the first m moments of (money made/good thing received). When m = 2, 
 this gives the guess received/got by Pratt, where 
 the risk higher cost is (fair in amount, related to/properly sized, related to) the variance of 
 n. Under risk neutrality, the utility function U(n:) is 
 linear, the risk high-quality R is zero, and making the most of 
 Eq. (2) reduces to making the most of the sum of expected 
 (money made/good thing received). However, risk disgust means that a2 u;an: 2 &amp;lt; 
 0 (Pratt, 1964). Then, Eq. (3) hints that the risk high-quality R increases with the variance of (money made/good thing received). Below, 
 we will think about/believe the case where m = 3. Going beyond 
 the variance, this includes the effects of skewness 
 or bad thing risk exposure on the risk higher cost. As 
 shown by Antle (1987), bad thing risk disgust means 
 that a3 u;alf 3 &amp;gt; 0, suggesting that the third central moment becomes (connected/related): decision-makers prefer a positive skewness as it reduces their exposure to bad thing 
 risk. 
 The model just presented is quite general: it includes 
 many sources of doubt connected with different outputs. However, in this paper, we focus on the 
 doubt connected with a particular output (corn). 
 For this purpose, assume that corn goes along with the 
 first valuable thing (i = 1). Let

 the first m moments of the distribution of (money made/good thing received) Jr1 
 
 This section discusses the econometric (detailed description of exactly what is required) used below in our scientific (act of asking questions and trying to find the truth about something) of the 
 distribution of com yield, moisture and (money made/good thing received). Let 
 /1-JJT(xl, t) = Exr(xl, t, e) represent the mean (money made/good thing received) or 
 first moment of (money made/good thing received) per area of land  of the first valuable thing. 
 And let /1-jrr(XI, t) = E[(:7rJ(XI, t, e)- /1-JJT(XI, t))i] 
 be the jth central moment of :7rJ, j = 2, ... , m, (may or may not happen, depending on something) on input decisions xr and on technology t. 
 Eq. (4) shows how the sure feeling equal of (money made/good thing received) depends on the mean profit f.J-lrr (x 1, t), on the variance of 
 profit, f.J-2rr (x 1, t), on the skewness of profit f.i-3JT (x 1, t), 
 etc. and on other interaction effects across activities. 
 This suggests a need to guess the moments of (money made/good thing received) 
 11- Jrr(XI, t), j = 1, 2, ... , 3. For that purpose, we specify a parametric form for each 11- Jrr and guess the 
 corresponding limits/guidelines. Let 11- )JT = fJ(xi, t, fi ). 
 where fi J is a vector of limits/guidelines. Then, think about/believe the 
 econometric model: 
 (5) 
 
 where VIJT is an error term distributed with mean zero, 
 E(vrJT) = 0. Then, treating (XJ, t) as (coming from the outside of something) (numbers that change/things that change), Eq. (5) represents a standard moving backward model 
 where the limits/guidelines fi 1 can be regularly guessed 
 by the least squares method. Let fiTs be the least 
 squares estimator of fir in Eq. (5), giving the least 
 squares leftover/extra v}:&#126; = 7rl - !I (x 1, t, fiTs). Think about/believe 
 the following model (detailed description of exactly what is required): 
 
 (6) 
 Then, the least squares guess of Eq. (6) gives fi&#126;, 
 a consistent estimator of fi2 (Antle, 1983). It follows 
 thatfz(xl, t, fi&#126;) is a consistent estimator of Var(VJrr ). 
 In the presence of heteroscedasticity, this provides a 
 basis for re-guessing Eq. (5) by generalized least 
 squares. The resulting estimator fi?LS is consistent, 
 asymptotically (producing a lot with very little waste), and asymptotically (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy). 
 This provides the estimator of expected (money made/good thing received) reported

 Var(Vjrr) = /2j- (/j) 2, the standard errors of pj need 
 to be corrected for heteroscedasticity. For that purpose, we put into use the procedure proposed by White 
 (1980) to get consistent guesses of the standard 
 errors of Pj in Eq. (6'). This provides the scientific

 Farm (money made/good thing received) n1 is a function of input choice x 1, 
 technology t, and doubt e. As pointed to/showed in 
 Eq. (1), it will be of interest to rot the effects 
 of (x 1, t, e) on farm (money made/good thing received) n1 into two main effects: 
 (1) production effects through the production function Y1 (x 1, t, e); and (2) cost effects through the cost 
 function C1(x1, t, e). 2 Both functions are (random/including random data points) 
 because they depend on the random (numbers that change/things that change) e. Following the moment-based approach, they can each 
 be represented by their central moments: mean, variance, skewness, etc. The scientific analysis of these 
 moments can be done in a way almost the same as  the 
 approach just discussed for the profit function. For 
 example, the central moments of the production function Y1 (x 1, t, e) can be limit/guidelineized as E (y 1) = 
 f.L1y = g1(x1, t,a1) for the expected value of yield 
 2 
 ' 
 E[(Y1 - f.L1y) ]_) = f.L2y = g2(x1, t, a2) for the variance of yield, E[(Y1 - f.L1y) 3 ]_) = f.L3y = g3 (x1, t, a3) 
 for the skewness of yield, etc. Following the guess method discussed above, the limits/guidelines of the 
 functions gj(X1, t, j{), j = 1, 2, ... , can be regularly guessed. (in almost the same way), the central moments 
 of the function C 1(x 1, t, e) can be limit/guidelineized 
 as E(C1) = f.L1c = h1(x1, t, y 1) for expected cost, 
 E[(C1 - f.Llc) 2] = f.L2c = h2(x1, t, y 2) for the variance of cost, E[(C1 - f.L1c) 3] = f.L3c = h3(x1, t, y 3) 
 for the skewness of cost, etc. Again, the limits/guidelines 
 2 For simpleness, we focus our attention on production and cost 
 doubt. This neglects the possible effects of price doubt. 
 Incorporating price risk into the analysis would be plain/honest/easy. 
 
 5. An computer program to corn 
 We apply the idea-based (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) developed in 
 the previous sections to com production, with a focus on the risk effects/results/suggestions of production doubt. 
 Especially, we examine the effects of technology 
 and climate change at the edge of Corn Belt. First, 
 Mendelsohn et al. (1994) has argued that the effects 
 of (related to the Earth's weather) change are expected to be more significant 
 in not important areas around the Com Belt. Second, describing the effects/results/suggestions of (related to computers and science) change at 
 the edge of the Com Belt allows us to examine the differential effects of (related to computers and science) change on com production over space. 
 Our analysis depends on com production and cost data 
 received/got from three research stations in Wisconsin: 
 Arlington, Marshfield and Spooner. The Arlington research station is in Southern Wisconsin, Spooner is 
 in Northern Wisconsin, while Marshfield is in Central Wisconsin. The Arlington station is located in the 
 Northern Corn Belt. So, the data from Arlington provide information on the effects of technology 
 and (related to the Earth's weather) changes on com production and costs in 
 the Corn Belt. In contrast, Marshfield and Spooner are 
 outside the Corn Belt. This means that the data from 
 Marshfield and Spooner provide useful information on 
 technology and climate effects in more not important areas 
 for corn production. 
 As one moves north in Wisconsin, corn yields decline as the growing season gets shorter. To deal with 
 this shorter growing season, farmers in Northern Wisconsin plant short-season corn combinations for at least two 
 reasons: (1) they give a higher chance of reaching 
 maturity before the end of the growing season; and 
 (2) they require lower drying costs. These trade-offs 
 are tested below. The data set consists of 24 years 
 (1974-1997) of produce and relative maturity 3 (RM) information created from long-term studies of corn 
 yields managed and did/done by the University of Wisconsin Farming-based Experiment Station. These (related to scientific farming) trial 
 3 Corn relative maturity is measured using the 'Minnesota relative maturity rating', a (done or made to look the same way every time) index describing the number of days it usually takes a corn combination to reach maturity.

 - N represents the number of (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements). 
 
 studies were designed to measure com combination performance. They measured produce and grain moisture for a 
 range of com combinations. Because other inputs (including 
 cultural practices) were completely managed during the experiment at each site, yield differences/different versions in each location are mainly due to the choice of combination maturity, (related to tiny chemical assembly instructions inside of living things) improvements and uncontrollable factors (mainly weather effects). This provides a basis 
 for testing the (change over time) of the distribution of corn 
 produce and cost over time and across space. 
 Table 1 summarizes the data for the three research 
 stations. Number of (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) (N), average growing degree days (GDD)4 and its standard moving away, 
 average yield (bushel/acre), average corn moisture at 
 harvest (%) and the range of RM for each location are 
 presented. As expected, as one moves north, average 
 GDD (lowers in number/gets worse). Below, we will examine the (change over time) 
 of GDD as a (substitute-related) measure of climate change. The 
 average yield over the sample period decreases as one 
 moves north. Relative maturity ranges from 85 to 120 
 in the south, and from 70 to 110 in the north, reflecting the different (related to the Earth's weather) conditions. 
 
 6. Guess results 
 Focusing on the first three central moments of the 
 distribution of corn yield, com moisture, GDD and 
 4 GDD is a temperature-based index commonly used as a summary measure of the length of the growing season for com. For 
 example, for a given location and growing season, the GDD index 
 for com is defined as 
 
 GDD = 
 
 L. &#126;[max(Tmini- 
 50)+ min(Tmaxi- 86)]- 50, 
 2 
 ' 
 
 where Tmini (Tmaxi) is the (almost nothing/very little) (maximal) temperature on day 
 i (in Â°F). It reflects the (not being there; not being present) of noticeable com growth for 
 temperatures below 50 or above 86Â°F. 
 
 corn (money made/good thing received), this section presents an scientific (act of asking questions and trying to find the truth about something) of (i) the (things that decide other things) of the distribution of 
 corn yield, (ii) the distribution of GDD and its (popular thing/general way things are going), 
 (iii) the factors affecting the moisture of corn grain at 
 harvest, and (iv) the distribution of corn (money made/good thing received) and its 
 (change over time) (both over time and across space). 
 
 6.1. Mean, variance and skewness of corn yield 
 As discussed in Section 4, we guess the factors 
 influencing the mean, variance and skewness of com 
 yield. First, we think about/believe the (random/including random data points) production 
 function representing corn yield, YI = 81 (xi, t, a1) + 
 VJy, where VJy is an error term distributed with mean 
 zero. We think about/believe two (detailed descriptions of exactly what is required). In the first 
 (Model I), we let XI = (RM, RM2 , T): yield is a 
 linear function of RM, RM2 , and a time trend T. The 
 introduction of RM 2 allows for possible non-linear 
 relationship between relative maturity and corn yield. 
 The time trend T takes by force/takes control of two effects, the hit/effect of 
 (related to computers and science) change (e.g. (related to tiny chemical assembly instructions inside of living things) progress) 5 on yield 
 (Cardwell, 1982), and the hit/effect of weather change 
 (Baker et al., 1993; Mendelsohn et al., 1994). The error term VIy accounts for unseen weather effects 
 and other uncontrollable factors affecting corn yield. 
 Note that this (detailed description of exactly what is required) goes along with an ex ante 
 analysis. It reflects the situation in which weather information is not known to farmers at planting time. In 
 contrast, our second (detailed description of exactly what is required) (Model II) attempts 
 5 More interesting measures of technology can possibly replace 
 time (popular thing/general way things are going). For example, (related to tiny chemical assembly instructions inside of living things) improvements can be directly 
 measured by different combinations applied. However, this is not included in our analysis because the number of combinations is very large 
 and the combinations change over time in our data. For example, some 
 of the combinations used in the early part of the sample are no longer 
 present in the later part. This makes it hard to find any simple way of incorporating the combination information in our analysis 
 beyond their RM rating.

 to untangle weather effects from (related to computers and science) change 
 by including GDD in g1 (Â·).Note that this (detailed description of exactly what is required) 
 is agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with an ex-post analysis since, for a given 
 year, information on GDD becomes known to farmers 
 only at harvest time. 
 Second, we think about/believe the variance of yield: f..L2y = 
 g2(x1, t, a2) + V2yÂ· We specify and guess the variance of corn produce as a linear function of RM and T. 
 Third, we (ask lots of questions about/try to find the truth about) the skewness of yield: f..L3y = 
 g3(x1, t, a3) + V3yÂ· This function is guessed using 
 a linear (detailed description of exactly what is required) with RM and a time trend T as 
 explanatory (numbers that change/things that change). 
 The econometric results are reported in Table 2. 
 From Table 2(A), the coefficient guesses in the expected yield equations (Model I and Model II) have 
 expected signs and a high level of importance. First, 
 the coefficients connected with RM are all (related to numbers) 
 significant for both (detailed descriptions of exactly what is required). In all three places/locations, we 
 find a positive and curved relationship between relative maturity and corn yield: long season combinations tend 
 to produce higher expected yield. Second, for both 
 (detailed descriptions of exactly what is required), the coefficients of time trend T are all 
 (meaningful numbers) at the 1% level. The positive 
 signs of the coefficients point to/show that expected corn 
 yield increases over time. In both models, the importance of the time (popular thing/general way things are going) produces increases as one moves 
 north. This identifies (related to space or existing in space) mixed-up nature in the effects of technology and climate changes on expected 
 corn yield. As discussed above, Model I presents an ex 
 ante analysis, where the time trend T takes by force/takes control of the joint 
 effects of weather change and working well growth. 
 In contrast, Model II presents an ex-post analysis, 
 (may or may not happen, depending on something) on GDD information. This allows separate guesses of the effects of weather change against/compared to/or 
 (related to computers and science) progress. In fact, to the extent that 
 GDD takes by force/takes control of the effects of weather change in Model 
 II, the time trend T would then take by force/take control of the effects of 
 (related to computers and science) change. Table 2 shows that the including in something 
 of GDD does not change  significantly the importance 
 of the guessed coefficients for time trend changeable 
 T. This points to/shows that working well growth rules 
 the effects of weather change. Also, it hints that 
 the time trend changeable T in the ex ante (detailed description of exactly what is required) 
 (Model I) (clearly and accurately shows) mostly the effects of (related to computers and science) change. This issue is further explored in the next 
 section. In the following, we depend on an ex ante (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) for guessing and testing three moments of 
 yield, moisture and (money made/good thing received) connected with corn pro- 
 
 133 
 
 duction. This reflects the fact that, at planting time, 
 the farmer makes decisions without knowing the production shocks that will become showed during the 
 growing season (e.g. rainfall, sicknesses, frosts, etc.). 6 
 Table 2(B) reports guess results for the variance of yield. The fairly low R 2 value hints that 
 a large part of the variance remains unexplained. 
 However, the variance of yield tends to increase over 
 time. While not significant in Arlington, this effect 
 becomes positive and significant as one moves north. 
 This hints that (related to computers and science) and (related to the Earth's weather) changes 
 have increased production risk for corn at the edge of 
 the Corn Belt (but possibly not within the Corn Belt). 
 The guess results for the skewness of yield is 
 reported in Table 2(C). We found no (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) of (meaningful numbers) relationship between relative maturity and the skewness of yield. While the choice of 
 relative maturity is (connected/related) in dealing with production 
 risk (as measured by the variance of yield), it suggests 
 that RM choice does not affect exposure to bad thing 
 yield doubt. At Arlington, positive and significant time (popular thing/general way things are going) hints that technology and climate 
 changes tend to increase the skewness of yield. This 
 hints that exposure to bad thing yield risk has (lowered in number/got worse/gotten worse) over time at Arlington. However, these effects 
 are not (meaningful numbers) outside the Corn Belt 
 (Marshfield and Spooner). 
 Next, we (ask lots of questions about/try to find the truth about) the nature of the exposure to 
 bad thing yield risk. For that purpose, we tested the 
 null guess that the yield distribution is matching, using a Wald statistic. The skewness coefficient 
 measuring matching of the distribution is defined as 
 s 1 = (!3) 2 1(f2) 3 , where .fi is the ith central moment 
 of yield (Greene, 1993, p. 310). Under the null guess of matching (s 1 = 0), the test statistic W = 
 N. (sV6) is distributed x2 (1). We tested for matching 
 at each site for different values of RM and at different 
 time periods. For Arlington and Marshfield, the test 
 results suggest that, in most cases, the null guess of 
 matching is rejected at the 5% importance level. The 
 test results then provide (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) that the distribution 
 
 6 An ex post approach testing the yield effects of weather 
 patterns during the growing season is of interest from an (related to scientific farming) 
 viewpoint. However, it would involve guessing weather effects 
 that are not known to the farmer at planting time. Below, we focus 
 our analysis on ex ante analysis relating the chance distribution 
 of yield to factors that are known to the farmer at planting time.

 of yield is skewed to the left (corresponding to a significant exposure to bad thing risk) in Arlington and 
 Marshfield. As one moves north (Spooner), the null 
 is rejected (without any concern about/having nothing to do with) the maturity length of corn 
 combinations. So, in general, we find (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) that the 
 distribution of yield is skewed to the left, suggesting a 
 significant exposure to bad thing yield risk. However, 
 one exception is at Arlington, where we did not reject the null for medium-season combinations in the 1990s, 
 while we rejected the null for the same combinations in the 
 1970s and the 1980s. This points to/shows that yield skewness has changed and that the exposure to bad thing 
 risk has (lowered in number/got worse/gotten worse) over time in Arlington. 
 6.2. (related to computers and science) change against/compared to/or (related to the Earth's weather) change 
 
 The guess results discussed in the previous 
 section show some big increases in the mean, 
 variance and skewness of yield over time. The combined effects of technology and climate changes on the mean, 
 variance and skewness of corn yield (captured by the 
 time (popular thing/general way things are going) 1), appear to change/differ  across places/locations. Different 
 Model I and Model II in Table 2(A), we have found 
 some (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) that most of the effects (taken/took by force)/(taken/took control of) by the 
 time (popular thing/general way things are going) are due to (related to computers and science) change. Below, 
 we provide some added/more (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) on this issue. 
 We think about/believe the (change over time) of the distributions of 
 GDD at each site. Since GDD is a temperature-based 
 index providing a summary measure of the length of 
 the growing season for corn, we use it as a substitute 
 for climate change. Using the moment-based approach 
 discussed in Section 4, the mean, variance and skewness of GDD are guessed as linear functions of a 
 time (popular thing/general way things are going). The results are presented in Table 3. As pointed to/showed in Table 3(A), the coefficient of the time trend 
 T in mean GDD equation is positive and (related to numbers) 
 significant for Marshfield. However, it is not (meaningful numbers) for Arlington and Spooner. So, for 
 Arlington and Spooner, there is no strong (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) of 
 a longer growing season (as measured by GDD). For 
 these stations, this weak (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) of worldwide  warming 
 produces hints that most of the yield (popular things/general ways things are going) could be 
 attributed to (related to computers and science) change. For Marshfield, we 
 find strong (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) of a longer growing season. This 
 is agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with helpful effects of worldwide  warming in the northern fringe of the US (Mendelsohn 
 et al., 1994; NOAA, 2000). On the other hand, as pointed to/showed in Table 2(A), we also find strong (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) of 
 
 combined effects of technology and climate changes on working well gain. Then, how much of working well gain 
 at Marshfield can be attributed to (related to computers and science) improvement? Compared with the once-a-year yield increase 
 of +1.87bushel/acre per year (+1.13% per year), an 
 increase of +0.42% per year in the growing season 
 (connected with an average once-a-year increase in GDD of 
 11.45 Â°F) is reported in Table 3(A). To the extent that 
 GDD increases are expected to create (fair in amount, related to something else/properly sized compared to something else) 
 changes in expected corn yield, this hints that about 
 37% of working well gain in Marshfield would be attributed to a longer growing season. This would suggest that 63% of working well gain may be connected 
 with (related to computers and science) change. In a way agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with 
 Thompson (1975, 1988) and Cardwell (1982), this points to/shows that only a small proportion of yield (popular thing/general way things are going) can 
 be attributed to changing weather patterns. 7 So, for 
 all three places/locations, (related to computers and science) progress seems the most in control/most common factor influencing working well (popular things/general ways things are going) in corn production. 
 Next, we test the hit/effect of (related to the Earth's weather) change 
 on production risk (as measured by the variance of 
 corn yield). Table 3(B) reports that the coefficient of 
 the time trend T in the variance of GDD equation is 
 positive and (meaningful numbers) for Arlington and 
 Marshfield. This hints that the growing season 
 has become more unpredictable at these locations. 
 However, the time trend effect is not (related to numbers) 
 significant at Spooner. So, at Spooner, there is no 
 strong (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) that the length of the growing season 
 has become more unpredictable. This hints that, 
 at the edge of the Corn Belt, it is not clear whether 
 worldwide  warming is adding/giving to increased corn yield 
 doubt. Yet, big increases in yield risk 
 have been reported in Table 2(B) for Spooner. To the 
 extent that they are not connected with (related to the Earth's weather) ups and downs, these changes can be attributed to changing 
 technology. This points to/shows that, along with higher 
 expected yields, improved technologies also bring an 
 increased exposure to production risk (e.g. improved 
 7 Added/more (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) is received/got by introducing the GDD (number or thing that changes) (as a substitute for climate change) in the expected yield equation 
 reported in Table 2A. After introducing GDD, the guessed coefficients for the time trend changeable T became 1.882, 1.987 and 
 2.208 for Arlington, Marshfield and Spooner, (match up each pair of items in order). These 
 guesses are very close to the ones reported in Table 2A. This points to/shows that the time trend changeable T mostly takes by force/takes control of the effects 
 of (related to computers and science) change.

 short-season combinations with better average yield but 
 more sensitivity to weather shocks). In contrast, in the 
 Corn Belt (Arlington), we find a big increase in 
 the unpredictability of the length of the growing season. Yet, as pointed to/showed in Table 2(B), there is no (number-based information that proves something) that the variance of yield has increased 
 over time in Arlington. These two study says that 
 (related to computers and science) progress in Arlington has added/has given 
 to reducing exposure to production risk in the Corn 
 Belt. This shows that (related to computers and science) progress interacts 
 with production risk in different ways across areas. 
 Finally, we ask about the effects of (related to the Earth's weather) 
 change on exposure to bad thing production risk. This 
 involves an (act of asking questions and trying to find the truth about something) of the skewness of GDD. As 
 pointed to/showed in Table 3(C), we find no (number-based information that proves something) 
 that the skewness of GDD has changed over time. To 
 the extent that the time (popular thing/general way things are going) takes by force/takes control of climate change, 
 this hints that the hit/effect of climate change on exposure to bad thing risk remains unchanged. Yet, we 
 found (meaningful numbers) increase in the skewness 
 of corn produce at Arlington. We understand/explain this to mean 
 that, at Arlington, most of the reduction in bad thing 
 risk can be attributed to (related to computers and science) progress (e.g. 
 due to new combinations that are more resistant to pests and 
 sicknesses). In all cases, we decide that (related to computers and science) 
 progress seems to be the most in control/most common factor influencing 
 the changing distribution of corn yield. 
 
 6.3. Mean, variance and skewness of corn moisture 
 This section explores corn grain moisture at harvest. Since the cost of drying depends on the moisture of corn grain at harvest, we examine the factors 
 affecting the doubt involved in drying cost. Expected moisture, variance of moisture, and skewness 
 of moisture are specified and guessed. The guess results are reported in Table 4 for each site. 
 Mean, variance and skewness of moisture equations 
 are specified as a linear function of relative maturity RM and a time trend T. Including a time (popular thing/general way things are going) 
 allows us to examine the effects of technology and 
 (related to the Earth's weather) changes on the (change over time) of moisture over 
 time. 
 As pointed to/showed in Table 4(A), the effects of RM on 
 mean corn grain moisture are positive and become 
 significant as one moves north. The variance of moisture also shows a positive relationship with RM, 
 suggesting that the risk connected with the unpredictability of corn grain moisture increases with corn 
 combination maturity. This relationship seems to become 
 more important as one moves north. As pointed to/showed 
 in Table 4(C), we find strong (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) of a (meaningful numbers) and positive relationship between 
 RM and the skewness of corn moisture at Arlington 
 and Marshfield. This hints that planting a longer

 season com combination increases the odds of facing high 
 moisture com at harvest time. 
 Next, we test the (change over time) of the distribution of 
 corn grain moisture. First, at Arlington, the coefficient 
 of the time (popular thing/general way things are going) in the expected moisture equation is 
 positive and (meaningful numbers). This means that 
 (related to computers and science) progress and (related to the Earth's weather) change tend to increase expected moisture, by that/in that way increasing drying 
 costs. With no (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) of changes in (related to the Earth's weather) (popular thing/general way things are going) 
 (Table 3(A)), this hints that most of these effects 
 can be attributed to (related to computers and science) progress at Arlington. However, as pointed to/showed by the (meaningful numbers) and negative relationship between time (popular thing/general way things are going) and 
 the skewness of moisture (Table 4(C)), (related to computers and science) 
 progress adds/gives to lowering the odds of facing 
 high moisture corn at harvest (which would reduce 
 drying cost). At Marshfield and Spooner, we find no 
 strong (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) of time (popular thing/general way things are going) effects on either expected 
 moisture or skewness of moisture. However, note that 
 these places/locations show (meaningful numbers) relationships 
 between time (popular thing/general way things are going) and the variance of moisture. 
 6.4. Mean, variance and skewness of corn (money made/good thing received) 
 Finally, we explore the effects/results/suggestions of technology and doubt on corn (money made/good thing received). We measure com 
 (money made/good thing received) as corn money/money income minus drying cost on a per area of land 
 
 basis. The corn price is assumed to be US$_$ 2.00 per 
 bushel. 8 The drying cost differs/changes depending on corn 
 moisture at harvest as well as farm type. We think about/believe 
 three farm types: a animals farm where corn is fed 
 directly to animals with no drying; a grain farm 
 using on-farm drying facilities; and a grain farm depending on commercial drying. 9 The expected value of 
 (money made/good thing received), its variance and its skewness are specified and 
 guessed as discussed in Section 4. The econometric 
 results are presented in Table 5. Table 5(A) summarizes the guess results for expected income by 
 farm type and by location (Arlington, Marshfield and 
 Spooner). The results are agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with those received/got in the analysis of expected yield (see Table 2 
 and the connected discussion). For example, the coefficients connected with relative maturity RM and 
 time (popular thing/general way things are going) Tare (meaningful numbers) (except RM2 
 8 So, the analysis presented here neglects price doubt. 
 The sensitivity of our results to price changes was tested. 
 While higher corn prices increase corn a money-making state, the scientific 
 findings presented below were found to be fairly strong. 
 9 On a animals farm, drying cost are zero and corn moisture 
 differences/different versions have no hit/effect on income. In contrast, corn drying affects cost under commercial drying, with a drying cost of 0.03 cent 
 per bushel per percentage moisture more than 15.5%. On-farm 
 drying represents an (middle-position) situation, with a drying cost of 
 0.015% per bushel per percentage moisture more than 15.5%.
