 Abstract 
 The guess of unevenness in price transmission within the Australian meat market is tested using monthly 
 data for beef, lamb and pork prices at different market levels over the period 1971-1988. The results point to/show that 
 (not mirror-images) price response is a plan used by beef and lamb stores and wholesalers to (change to make better/change to fit new conditions) to changing input 
 prices, but not by pork stores and wholesalers. This difference is maybe unexpected given the (thing that's almost the same as another thing) in 
 behaviours relating to price levelling in this market, the high cross-price elasticities of demand between these meats, 
 and the (compared to other things) greater degree of concentration in the pork market. 
 
 1. Introduction 
 
 Previous research has confirmed the presence 
 of (for only a short time) price levelling behaviour in the 
 Australian meat market (Naughtin and Quilkey, 
 1979; Griffith, Green and Duff, 1991). Price levelling refers to the practice of wholesalers (stores) holding their selling prices staying steady in the face of rising or falling sale (wholesale) prices. In effect, the resultant hit/effect of 
 ups and downs in raw material prices on the prices 
 charged to people is smoothed or made less 
 dangerous under price levelling. The (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) of this

 type of behaviour by meat wholesalers and stores has caused increasing concern about the (wasting very little while working or producing something) of the meat market. First, as has been 
 demonstrated by (area controlled by a church) (1967), price levelling 
 destabilises farm level prices while stabilising retail prices. Animals producers in particular are 
 concerned that changes in prices at the farm level 
 are both greater than they should be and are not 
 fully passed onto the higher levels of the market, 
 and so do not influence personal (instance of buying something for money) decisions. Second, there is the bad feeling that wholesalers and stores are more likely to pass on 
 price rises than price falls. This is known as 
 not mirror-images price transmission. 
 The ability of the wholesale and retail parts/areas 
 to begin/try these types of pricing plans 
 depends mostly on the competitive structure of these parts/areas. Fewer, larger firms may

 complete and fast pass-through of cost increases but slower and less complete transmission 
 of cost savings" (Kinnucan and Forker, 1987, p. 
 285). In the Australian meat producing, processing and distribution parts/areas there have been some 
 hidden (under) changes with respect to structure in 
 the last few years, especially in the intensive businesses. 
 Beef and lamb are the two traditional red meats 
 produced in Australia, mainly from long/big (area of grassy land) grazing systems, while pork is one of the 
 major meats produced from intensive, indoor 
 production systems. The increasing concentration 
 in the pig processing and marketing parts/areas has 
 been well recorded/supported (Bennett, 1982). Almost the same 
 combining, though not to the same extent, has 
 happened in the beef and lamb processing and 
 marketing parts/areas. This difference/different version in concentration 
 in the Australian long/big and intensive meat 
 businesses may clear/understandable/show  different patterns of 
 (not mirror-images) pricing behaviour. Another possible 
 cause of differences may be differences/different versions in the 
 proportion of output exported and in the high levels of domestic per-person use of each 
 meat. 
 An understanding of price (creation and construction/ group of objects) and price 
 transmission, including not mirror-images pricing behaviour, is important in explaining the patterns 
 of price transmission processes and pricing inefficiencies in the marketing of valuable things. It is 
 also important in adding/giving to policy discussions relating to such issues as the (reasons) 
 of processing ability (to hold or do something), the regulation of throughput in the processing part/area, and the distribution 
 of the benefits of research among producers, 
 processors and people. The value of this information is not held back to developed farming-based (processes of people making, selling, and buying things) such as Australia, but also 
 extends to developing countries where pressure is 
 seen/obvious for better useful thing/valuable supply portion and more 
 (producing a lot with very little waste) marketing channels. 
 Most computer programs to date in this area have 
 been done/tried in the United States, mainly in 
 the pork market, and this is where the way(s) of doing things has been developed. Heien (1980) and 
 Schroeder (1988) found (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) of unevenness in 
 wholesale-retail pork price relationships. What's more, Hahn (1990) found that the farm, wholesale and retail prices of pork showed significant 
 
 (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) of not mirror-images price interactions, with 
 retail prices displaying greater sensitivity to price 
 increasing shocks than to price (lowering in number/getting worse) shocks. 
 Or, Boyd and Brorsen (1988, p. 103) 
 found " ... that wholesale (packer) prices respond 
 (in almost the same way) to farm price decreases and increases. 
 Also there is no a big difference between 
 stores' response to wholesale price increases 
 and their response to wholesale price decreases." 
 Some studies have examined the United States 
 beef market. Hall, Tomek, Ruther and Kyerine 
 (1981) found no (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) of unevenness in farmwholesale or wholesale-retail beef price relationships. They ended/decided (p. 21) that "Wholesalers 
 and stores do not appear to have treated increases in farm or dead body prices in a manner 
 different than decreases." However, Hahn (1990) 
 found that the farm, wholesale and retail prices 
 of beef showed significant (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) of not mirror-images price interactions. Prices displayed greater 
 sensitivity to price increasing shocks than to price 
 declining shocks. 
 This issue of not mirror-images price transmission 
 has not been examined for the processing and 
 marketing parts/areas of the Australia meat market 
 except for a brief exploring things by Freebairn (1984) 
 and some recent work by Lye and Sibley (1991). 
 In a markup model explaining retail food prices 
 by farm prices, wages and the price of a substitute product, Freebairn added a dummy (number or thing that changes) 
 to point to/show periods when farm prices were rising. 
 He found a non-significant coefficient on this 
 (number or thing that changes) for all foods studied including beef, lamb 
 and pork. This way the guess of (not mirror-images) 
 responses to price rises and price falls was not 
 supported. Lye and Sibly (1991), using customer 
 market analysis (focusing person expectations about prices) and this data set, found that 
 retail meat prices in New South Wales were 
 stubborn/unable to move, and more so in the downward direction 
 than the upward direction. (not mirror-images) (change to make better/related to changing something) of prices was ended/decided. 
 The aim in this paper is to test the guess 
 of (for only a short time) retail and wholesale price unevenness in the Australian beef, lamb and pork markets 
 using a different way(s) of doing things to those employed 
 (before that/before now) by Freebairn (1984) and Lye and Sibley (1991).

 2. Way(s) of doing things 
 
 Background issues. The markup pncmg model 
 popularised by Heien (1980) forms the basis for 
 most later research in this area. This model 
 is: 
 
 (1) 
 where PR is retail price of the valuable thing under 
 analysis, PF is farm price of the valuable thing on a 
 retail equal basis, C represents processing 
 and marketing costs; and the data are usually 
 measured at monthly periods of time (or space). 
 The use of this pricing rule rests on a few 
 critical ideas (you think are true). First, the market for the 
 valuable thing is assumed to be competitive. It is 
 clear that concentration levels in meat processing 
 and distribution in Australia have increased in 
 the last few years. For example in New South Wales 
 the four largest pig murdering organisations 
 accounted for 54% of total export licensed 
 murder in 1978 and 60% in 1984. The 20 or so 
 Australian pigmeat processing firms in the largest 
 employment size group make up/be equal to only 15% of 
 firms yet account for over 65% of turnover, value 
 added and employment (Griffith and Gill, 1987). 
 Some 40% of meat is sold through supermarkets 
 and two large chains rule this market 
 (Australian Meat and Animals Corporation, 
 1993). However, there are still large numbers of 
 processors, wholesalers and stores in the Australian red meat industry, and the overall levels of 
 concentration, although rising, remain (compared to other things) 
 low (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 1990). This way 
 this idea (you think is true) seems reasonable. 
 Second, the processing function is assumed to 
 be a Leontief-type fixed proportions change, with no possibility of other marketing inputs 
 being substituted for the farm valuable thing when 
 relative prices change. This is recognised as a 
 strong idea (you think is true) but there is a lack of scientific 
 (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) on this. However, given that the data 
 are monthly, one would expect only limited 
 substitutability if any over this time period, hence 
 the idea (you think is true) may be of little result in 
 practice. It would be hard to make such an 
 idea (you think is true) with once-a-year data however.

 Third, constant returns to scale are assumed. 
 This is equal to assuming constant not important 
 costs of processing, or that differences/different versions in the volume of the farm valuable thing going through processing have no influence in explaining price transmission behaviour. This is maybe the most angry of the ideas (you think are true) in the big picture  of the 
 Australian meat industry, as previous work using 
 these or almost the same  data has generally shown a significant negative relationship between the farm-retail margin and the amount of animals being 
 processed (Griffith, 1974; Griffith, Green and 
 Duff, 1991). This way increasing returns to scale are 
 pointed to/showed, and a throughput (number or thing that changes) should be 
 added to the basic markup model. 
 Fourth, there is an hidden (under) idea (you think is true) that 
 the retail price changes in response to a change 
 in price at the farm or wholesale level. So farm 
 price "causes" retail price in the Granger sense 
 (Granger, 1969). Although (things causing other things to happen) tests are not 
 conducted here, Freebairn (1984) has shown that 
 for beef and pork in the Sydney market the farm 
 price does in fact "cause" the retail price. Further, using a cross-(ghost-related/rainbow-related) analysis Griffith (1975) 
 ended/decided possibly/uncertainly that pork sale prices did 
 lead retail prices, so although there may be problems understanding/explaining Granger (things causing other things to happen) tests, the 
 cross-(ghost-related/rainbow-related) results provide some backing up (with proof) 
 (event(s) or object(s) that prove something). Because of this this idea (you think is true) seems reasonable for beef and pork. However, for lamb, Freebairn found that retail price "causes" farm price 1- 
 This may be of some concern in understanding/explaining the 
 results for lamb. 
 Two other methodological issues also require 
 (serious thought/something to think about/respect), First, when data occasionality is 
 monthly as in this study, the question of falls behind  in 
 
 1 Freebairn rejected the null guess that future values of 
 beef (pork) retail prices as a group had no influence on 
 current beef (pork) farm prices. (in the opposite way), he could not 
 reject the null guess that future values of farm prices as a 
 group had no influence on current retail prices. This way current 
 values of farm prices were connected with future values of 
 retail prices, but not the other way around, too. For beef and pork, farm 
 prices "cause" retail prices. However, for lamb, current values 
 of retail prices were connected with future values of farm 
 prices, but not the other way around, too. For lamb, retail price "causes" farm 
 price.

 responses become important. There are some reasons why changes in retail price usually tend to lag changes in farm price (Heien, 
 1980; Hall, Tomek, Ruther and Kyerine, 1981; 
 Ward, 1982) such as the time needed/demanded to actually 
 perform the processing, storage, transport and 
 distribution functions; differences in price collection and reporting methods; the cost of stores 
 changing prices; and differences in information 
 availability, transmission and use at different levels of the market. Therefore, in setting up a 
 model to test the unevenness pricing guess, 
 some form of lag structure should be incorporated on the (things that you control (like study times), that cause other things to change (like test scores)). Also, as is 
 well known, problems of autocorrelation are 
 highly likely with monthly data. 
 Second, there is the issue of whether the dependent and (things that you control (like study times), that cause other things to change (like test scores)) should be 
 changed in some way to more correctly mea-

 where following Kinnucan and Forker (1987) the (numbers that change/things that change) are

 sure the differential hits/effects of rising and falling 
 price phases. The ordinary method (Ward, 
 1982; Kinnucan and Forker, 1987; Schroeder, 
 1988) is that two farm price (numbers that change/things that change), PFR (rising) 
 and PFF (falling) - or two wholesale price (numbers that change/things that change) - should be built following Houck 
 (1977, p. 571) as shown in Table 1. The (thing that changes (like a test score) because of something else that you control (like study time)) and any other (things that you control (like study times), that cause other things to change (like test scores)) 
 should be expressed as mistakes from their (pertaining to each person or thing) initial values. This way of doing things is based on 
 earlier work by Wolffram (1971) and Houck (1977) 
 dealing with (not mirror-images) supply response and by 
 Heien (1980) who extended the method to price 
 transmission. Houck (1977) provides a described/explained 
 reason for using these types of changes. The key point is that the method rots or dividing walls/walls off/sections changes in the dependent 
 (number or thing that changes), from a previous position in time (the 
 initial values) into changes due to rising input 
 prices, falling input prices, and other factors. In 
 applying the model, Heien (1980) calculated the 
 rising and falling farm price (numbers that change/things that change) but did not 
 use any lag structure. Later studies have 
 calculated the PFR and PFF (numbers that change/things that change) and (forced (on people)/caused an inconvenient situation) 
 distributed falls behind (e.g. Ward, 1982). 
 Guessing model and guess. The model used 
 for guess in this study, based on Kinnucan 
 and Forker (1987) and the discussion above, is as 
 follows: 
 
 where for each meat, PFR and PFF are built 
 (numbers that change/things that change) representing the rising and falling phases of 
 PF as shown in Table 1, Q is the production of 
 meat, T is a trend term, and E is a random error; 
 the other (numbers that change/things that change) are as (before that/before now) defined; and 
 a, ... , f are coefficients to be guessed. 
 The first summary (number or thing that changes) is always positive, 
 while the second is always negative. Almon distributed lag procedures are (forced (on people)/caused an inconvenient situation) on the calculated rising and falling (numbers that change/things that change), PFR and PFF, so i 
 and j are the lengths of the Almon falls behind  on PFR 
 and PFF, (match up each pair of items in order). The retail price, cost and 
 amount (numbers that change/things that change) are expressed as mistakes 
 from their (pertaining to each person or thing) initial values. Neither the 
 
 G.R. Griffith, N.E. Piggott j Farming-based Money flow 10 (1994) 307-316 
 
 cost nor amount (numbers that change/things that change) are specified in distributed lag forms. Cost changes slowly over 
 time and as Heien (1980) has noted, stores 
 tend to use the smoothed value of cost as a basis 
 for pricing (see also Griffith, Green and Duff, 
 1991). Probably, these stores would also even 
 out the price hits/effects of throughput ups and downs. 
 The ci coefficients represent the net effect of 
 rising farm prices on retail prices while the dj 
 coefficients represent the net effect of falling 
 farm prices on retail prices. The appropriate test 
 of whether there is a a big difference in the 
 sum of the coefficients of the rising phase of farm 
 prices against/compared to/or the falling phase in farm prices can 
 be formally represented as: 
 Ha: L:ici = L:jdj 
 
 (3) 
 
 H 1 : H 0 not true 
 
 ( 4) 
 
 A t-test was used to test this null guess. 
 Equal models to that specified in Eq. (2) are 
 also specified for the farm-wholesale and the 
 wholesale-retail parts/pieces of the price transmission process. So in all there are nine equations to be guessed. Also, in all models, a 
 dummy (number or thing that changes) DD is added to reflect a change 
 in price calculation procedures in 1980, and 
 monthly dummy (numbers that change/things that change) n1, ... , n11 are added 
 to measure any seasonal patterns not already 
 accounted for. 
 Different modelling (solid basic structures on which bigger things can be built) to Eq. (2) 
 that have been used in the unevenness and price 
 transmission books are the Vector Autoregressive (VAR) Models of Babula, Bessler and 
 Schulter (1990) and the Generalised Switching 
 Model (GSM) of Hahn (1990). VAR is a "dataoriented way of doing things [which] provides (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) on 
 the energetic properties of relationships" (Babula 
 et al., 1990, p. 13). However, no explanation of 
 the reasons for this behaviour is given. More 
 (related to what holds something together and makes it strong), money-based models, such as those reported here, are needed/demanded for this purpose. Hahn 
 (1990, p. 21) thinks about/believes his GSM to be "the rough 
 equal of a set of (having no limits, rules, or barriers) reduced form 
 equations for a general set of endogenous switching (moving backwards) relating the farm, wholesale, and 
 retail prices of a meat." The models reported 
 here are (related to what holds something together and makes it strong) models rather than reduced 
 
 311 
 
 form models, and are therefore more suited to 
 explanation of the factors causing price transmission differences across meats. Neither of these 
 other choice models are applied in this study, but a 
 comparison of results and policy effects/results/suggestions from 
 each would be of interest. 
 
 3. Data 
 
 Monthly data for the period January 1971 to 
 December 1988 were used (n = 216) for the following (numbers that change/things that change): 
 PFk 
 Monthly guessed dressed auction dead body price, in centsjkg, of (made up of different things) beef, 
 lamb and pork dead bodies sold at Homebush 
 sale-yards in Sydney and (changed to make better/changed to fit new conditions) for 
 (things produced along with something else) and shrinkage. 
 Pwk 
 Monthly wholesale price, in centsjkg, of 
 (made up of different things) beef, lamb and pork dead bodies 
 sold in the Homebush meat halls in Sydney and (changed to make better/changed to fit new conditions) for shrinkage. 
 PRk 
 Monthly (made up of different things) retail price, in cents/ 
 kg, of beef, lamb and pork at selected 
 retail outlets in Sydney. 
 cwk 
 Indices of monthly wholesale marketing 
 costs for beef, lamb and pork. Murdering fees contain over 50% of wholesale 
 operating costs, so murdering fees 
 charged at Homebush slaughterhouse in Sydney 
 were used as a substitute for all wholesale 
 costs. The base period was January 1971 
 = 100.00. 
 cR 
 An index of monthly retail marketing costs. 
 Since wages add/give over 50% of retail 
 operating expenses, the weekly wage rate 
 for a New South Wales General Butcher 
 Shopman under the Federal Meat Industry Award was used as a substitute for all 
 retailing costs. The base was January 1971 
 = 100.00. 
 Qk 
 Throughput of each meat. Due to the 
 closure of the Homebush slaughterhouse in mid 
 1988, it was not possible to get 
 throughput at the Homebush meat halls. 
 As a (substitute-related) New South Wales production 
 of beef, lamb and pigmeat was used.

 beef, lamb and pork. 
 
 All the basic sale, wholesale and retail price 
 data came from the records of the now Money-based 
 Services Unit of N.S.W. Agriculture. The procedures for (changing to make better/changing to fit new conditions) and weighting these prices 
 and for calculating the wholesale and retail 
 spreads are organized and listed in detail by Griffith, Strong, 
 Green and Freshwater (1992). Murdering fees 
 came from the records of the Homebush Slaughterhouse 
 Corporation and the N.S.W. Meat Industry Authority, throughput came from the Australian 
 Meat and Animals Corporation, and wage rates 
 came from the Meat and Together/partnered Trades Federation and the N.S.W. Department of Industrial 
 Relations. The price and cost (numbers that change/things that change) were all 
 expressed in (in name only/very small amount) terms. 
 As noted above, PFR and PFF were calculated 
 from PF, and the equal rising and falling 
 wholesale price (numbers that change/things that change) PWR and PWF were calculated from PW, for use in the guessing equations. For beef, about 51% of the (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) on PF and 50% of (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) on PW 
 were falling, while for lamb the (connected/related) percentages were very almost the same, 49% and 51%. For pork, 
 about 44% of the (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) on PF and 
 41% of (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) on PW were falling, so a 
 reliable guess of the presence or (not being there; not being present) of 
 (not mirror-images) price response should be able to be 
 gave/given. 
 
 4. Guess way of doing things 
 
 The nine equations were guessed using least 
 squares procedures. Limited (trying new things out/testing ideas scientifically) in. dicated that autocorrelation was common and all 
 later equations were guessed with a 
 first-order correction. 
 
 The question of both/together choosing lag length and 
 order of polynomial for the Almon falls behind  was settled as follows. First, the lengths of the falls behind 
 were figured out by/decided by adding fell behind (numbers that change/things that change) until 
 unimportant coefficients were met using 
 a t-test. Where significant lag lengths greater 
 than two were found, higher order polynomials 
 were tested for using an F-test. 
 
 5. Results 
 
 Guessed equations. The results of guessing the 
 nine equations of the form specified in Eq. (2) 
 above, using the data changes and methods described there, are reported in Tables 2, 3 
 and 4 for beef, lamb and pork, (match up each pair of items in order). 
 There were some common features of all of 
 these equations: the very high level of explained variance; the large size and high importance of the rho coefficient, which pointed to/showed that 
 there was very strong positive autocorrelation in 
 the raw extras/payments; the overall lack of importance 
 of seasonality, significant only in the pork farmwholesale and in the lamb farm-wholesale price 
 linkages; and the short lag lengths which were 
 significant in the Almon falls behind, only reaching a lag 
 of three months in the lamb wholesale-retail linkage (Table 3). 
 Features which differed across equations included the influence of cost factors, which were 
 significant in five of the nine equations, but opposite to expectations - were mostly negative; 
 the influence of time (popular things/general ways things are going), which were mostly 
 significant for lamb and pork but not for beef; the 
 influence of the dummy (number or thing that changes) for the change 
 in calculation procedure, which was significant 
 for beef but not generally for lamb or pork; and 
 the influence of throughput, which had a significant effect on the explanation of price transmission for lamb but not generally for beef or pork. 
 Only the lag lengths for lamb were greater 
 than two (Table 3). An F-test of the null guess of a linear model could not be rejected. All 
 Almon polynomials were therefore linear.

 Unevenness guess. A test of the unevenness 
 guess was created following Mendenhall, 
 Schaeffer and Wackerly (1981): 
 
 (I:;C;- L:jdj) 
 
 t = """"""r.?==='=============- 
 
 v[vAR(I:;c;- L;jdj)]_) 
 
 where the variance of the difference between the 
 sums is calculated from the variances of each of 
 the parts/pieces of both sums and the covariances 
 between each of the parts/pieces of both sums. 
 This procedure was followed for each of the 
 equations guessed in this study and the results 
 
 are reported near the bottom of Tables 2, 3 
 and 4. 
 The results show that for six of the nine price 
 linkages (all three beef; wholesale-retail and 
 farm-retail Iamb; and farm-wholesale pork), the 
 total effect on the (thing that changes (like a test score) because of something else that you control (like study time)) of 
 rising input prices (I:;c) went beyond the total amount of 
 effect of falling input prices (L:jd). In three of 
 these six cases (beef wholesale-retail and farm-retail, and lamb wholesale-retail) the test statistics 
 were very different from zero, rejecting 
 the null guess. This way there was unevenness in

 wholesale or retail price transmission between 
 periods of rising and falling farm or wholesale 
 prices, in these three cases, over this data period. 
 Price rises were passed on more fully than price 
 falls in these cases. In the other three cases 
 where the total amount of rise went beyond the total amount of fall (beef and pork farm-wholesale and Iamb 
 farm-retail), the test statistics were not very different from zero, failing to reject the 
 null guess. This way there was no unevenness in 
 price transmission in these events. 
 In the remaining three price linkages (lamb 
 farm-wholesale, and pork farm-retail and wholesale-retail), the total amount of effect on retail price 
 
 of falling farm or wholesale prices ('[,jd) went beyond the total amount of effect of rising farm or 
 wholesale prices ('[,icJ For the two pork linkages 
 (Table 4), the test statistics were not significantly 
 different from zero, failing to reject the null 
 guess. This way the results point to/show no unevenness in wholesale or retail price transmission between periods of rising and falling pork farm or 
 wholesale prices, over this data period. However, 
 in the lamb farm-wholesale linkage (Table 3), the 
 test statistic was very different from zero, 
 rejecting the null guess. This way some unevenness in lamb wholesale price transmission between 
 periods of rising and falling farm prices seems 
 obvious over this data period. Price falls were 
 passed on more fully than price rises in this case. 
 Further, there was some (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) that the 
 response to price changes at lower levels of the 
 market was slower for beef and lamb price rises 
 than for price falls because in most of the equations there was a longer fell behind response on the 
 rising prices than there was on the falling prices. 
 For pork, however, this did not seem to be seen/obvious because in one of the equations there was a 
 fell behind response on the falling prices while in the 
 other equations there was a fell behind response on 
 the rising prices. 
 The means of the price rises and price falls for 
 each price level were also examined, using a 
 t-test for the difference between two sample 
 means. The results are reported in Table 5. For 
 each of the nine prices, the mean increases were 
 greater than the mean decreases, but only for 
 beef and pork retail prices were these differences 
 significant (at the 5% and 10% levels, (match up each pair of items in order)). This suggested that for these two cases, 
 retail prices (changed to make better/changed to fit new conditions) less fully to falling wholesale prices than to rising wholesale prices. This 
 confirmed the (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) reported in Table 2 for 
 beef, where the coefficient on the price fall (number or thing that changes) was less than the coefficient on the price rise 
 (number or thing that changes) in the two (connected/related) equations. However, 
 the results argued the (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) for pork, 
 where the coefficient on the price rise (number or thing that changes) 
 was less than the coefficient on the price fall 
 (number or thing that changes) in the two (connected/related) equations. 
 Finally, there were more price rises than price 
 falls at the retail level, and the actual numbers of

 rises and falls were very almost the same  reflecting the 
 high cross-price elasticities of demand between 
 these meats (Piggott and Griffith, 1992). The 
 picture was somewhat different at the farm and 
 wholesale levels where there were almost the same  numbers of price rises and price falls, except for pork 
 at the farm level where the number of rises 
 went beyond the number of falls by a big 
 margin. At the wholesale level there were a (compared to other things) greater number of "no changes", especially 
 for pork. This fact reinforced findings of shortterm price levelling at the wholesale level found 
 in other work (Griffith, Green and Duff, 1991). 
 For pork, the big number of "no changes" 
 may explain why neither of the parts/pieces of 
 the overall pork farm-retail price linkage showed 
 any significant unevenness behaviour. The wholesale market was disrupting the process of transmitting changes in market conditions between the 
 different levels of the market. 
 
 6. Summary and Ends/end results 
 
 In this paper the guess of (not mirror-images) 
 pricing behaviour in the Australian beef, lamb 
 and pork market has been examined. There were 
 five main results. First, the total amount of effect on 
 retail or wholesale price of the rising wholesale or 
 
 315 
 
 farm beef and lamb price (number or thing that changes) went beyond the 
 total effect of the falling wholesale or farm 
 price (number or thing that changes) in five of the six (connected/related) equations. 
 Three of these equations rejected the null guess suggesting that there was some unevenness in price transmission between periods of rising 
 and falling wholesale or farm beef and lamb 
 prices. In the sixth equation, the total amount of effect on wholesale lamb price of the falling farm 
 lamb price (number or thing that changes) went beyond the total amount of effect of the rising farm price (number or thing that changes), with the test 
 statistic being significant. Again this suggests 
 unevenness. 
 Second, the total amount of effect on retail or 
 wholesale price of the rising wholesale or farm 
 pork price (number or thing that changes) did not go beyond the total amount of 
 effect of the falling wholesale or farm price (number or thing that changes) in two of the three (connected/related) equations. In the 
 third equation, the total amount of effect on wholesale pork price of the rising farm pork price 
 (number or thing that changes) went beyond the total amount of effect of the 
 falling farm price (number or thing that changes). However, in each case, 
 the test statistics were very small, pointing to/showing failure to reject the null guess. The results 
 suggest that there was no unevenness in price 
 transmission between periods of rising and falling 
 wholesale or farm pork prices. 
 Third, for each of the three prices of each 
 meat, the mean increases were greater than the 
 mean decreases, although only for beef and pork 
 retail prices were these differences significant. 
 This hints that the beef and pork retail prices 
 (change to make better/change to fit new conditions) less fully to falling wholesale prices than to 
 rising wholesale prices. 
 Fourth, for pork there were a much greater 
 number of price rises than price falls at the farm 
 and retail levels. The picture was somewhat different at the wholesale level where there were 
 almost the same  numbers of price rises and price falls and 
 a big number of "no changes". This fact 
 reinforces findings of price levelling at the wholesale level found in other work (Griffith, 1974; 
 Naughtin and Quilkey, 1979; Griffith, Green and 
 Duff, 1991). 
 Finally, for beef and lamb there were a much 
 greater number of price rises than price falls at 
 the retail level. At the farm and wholesale levels 
 there were almost the same  numbers of price rises and 
 
 316 
 
 G.R. Griffith, N.E. Piggott I Farming-based Money flow 10 (1994) 307-316 
 
 price falls and at the wholesale level there were a 
 greater number of "no changes". Again findings 
 of price levelling at the wholesale level found in 
 other work are validated. 
 Therefore this study provides new (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) 
 which confirms Freebairn's (1984) end/end result relating to the (not being there; not being present) of price unevenness for pork, 
 but not for beef and lamb. (in the opposite way), for beef 
 and lamb the results of this study agreement/peace with 
 those of Lye and Sibly (1991) who found (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) 
 of (not mirror-images) (change to make better/related to changing something) of retail prices in the 
 New South Wales meat market. 
 On balance it appears that in the Australian 
 meat market, (not mirror-images) price response is an 
 (change to make better/related to changing something) plan used by beef and lamb stores and wholesalers to deal with input price 
 changes, but it is not employed by pork stores 
 and wholesalers. This difference in behaviour is 
 maybe unexpected given the (thing that's almost the same as another thing) in behaviours relating to price levelling and the high 
 cross-price elasticities. Also, given the (compared to other things) 
 greater degree of concentration in the pig market, if any meat was to show (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) of unevenness it would be expected to have been pork.
