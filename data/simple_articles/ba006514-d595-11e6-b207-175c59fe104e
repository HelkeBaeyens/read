 Abstract 
 Over the last few years, there has been increasing focus in the (away from cities) development books on the multiple income-creating 
 activities begun/tried by (away from cities) families and the importance of valuable things in deciding/figuring out the ability to begin/try these activities. 
 Controlling for the endogeneity of activity choice and applying Lee's (big statement based on very little information) of Amemiya's two-step estimator to a 
 (happening together) equation model, household returns to valuable things from many activities are explored for the Mexico ejido part/area. To 
 includes the many (numbers that change/things that change) representing social and public capital into the analysis, factor analysis is used. The results 
 point to/show that the valuable thing position of the household has a significant effect on household participation in income-creating 
 activities and returns to those activities. What's more, including measures of social and public capital into the analysis 
 show that these valuable things play an important role in income-creating activities and that the influence is dependent on the type 
 of social and public capital as well as the particular activity.

 1. Introduction 
 Over the last few years, there has been increasing focus 
 within the (away from cities) development books on what is 
 referred to as (away from cities) jobs and job (getting involved with different types of things; not sticking with only one thing). A key feature of the idea  of jobs 
 is the link between valuable things, activities and income and

 the role of the institutional big picture  in deciding/figuring out the 
 use of and returns to valuable things. For example, Ellis (2000) 
 defines a job as making up "the valuable things (natural, physical, human, (money-related) and respect), the 
 activities and the access to these (judged by institutions and social relations) that together decide/figure out the 
 living gained by an individual or household". Job (getting involved with different types of things; not sticking with only one thing) is then the process by which 
 families construct a (many different kinds of people or things) (mix of stocks, bonds, etc./document collection) of activities 
 and valuable things to survive and improve their standard of 
 living (Ellis, 2000). 
 The jobs approach has played an important 
 role in highlighting the many activities begun/tried

 by (away from cities) families, the importance of valuable things in deciding/figuring out the ability to begin/try activities, the energetic nature of the actions of (away from cities) families and the 
 link between the (getting involved with different types of things; not sticking with only one thing) of valuable things and activities 
 (Barrett and Reardon, 2000). (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) from developing countries points to/shows that (away from cities) families depend on 
 some valuable things and employ many activities to 
 create income. Especially, there has been strong 
 (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) pointing to/showing the increasing importance of (away from cities) 
 non-farm activities. Reardon et al. (2001), for example, show that, based on a set of studies from Latin 
 America, (away from cities) non-farm activities make up 40% of 
 (away from cities) household income. What's more, the (popular thing/general way things are going) is toward greater non-farm activities for (away from cities) residents. 
 While the jobs approach has added/has given to 
 our understanding of (away from cities) household behaviour, there 
 has been little scientific examination of the approach. 
 Some recent studies have recognised the role 
 of a (many different kinds of people or things) set of valuable things in income-creating activities. For example, Lanjouw (1999, 2001) examines 
 non-farm income in Ecuador and El Salvador using 
 valuable things such as workers (education, reading and writing ability), natural capital (land) and public capital (electrification, 
 water connection) as explanatory (numbers that change/things that change). Winters 
 et al. (2001) explore the role of valuable things, including social 
 and public capital, in the decision to move. Place 
 and Reardon (2001), and De Janvry and Sadoulet 
 (2001) explore the importance of natural, human, 
 social and public capital in the generation of income 
 in Nicaragua and Mexico, (match up each pair of items in order). While recognising the importance of valuable things in income-creating 
 activities, these studies do not think about/believe both the (happening together) nature of (strategy for investing money wisely) and the selectivity 
 bias created by the decision to participate in an activity. 
 One recent study that does think about/believe these issues is 
 by Taylor and Yunez-Naude (2000). Their paper focuses on the returns to schooling from a (many different kinds of people or things) set of 
 activities in (away from cities) Mexico widening (serious thought/something to think about/respect) to 
 both household head and family education. Taylor and 
 Yunez-Naude's paper is interesting from an econometric point of view in that they carefully face/deal with issues 
 affecting bias and inefficiency in limit/guideline guesses. 
 By controlling for endogeneity of activity choice and 
 using Lee's (big statement based on very little information) of Amemiya's two-step estimator in a (happening together)-equation model, the resulting estimators are asymptotically (producing more with less waste) than 
 other two-stage estimators, such as the commonly used 
 Heckman procedure. 
 
 In this study, we use the same econometric approach as Taylor and Yunez-Naude to explore job plans in the Mexican ejido part/area. Unlike 
 Taylor and Yunez-Naude, our main interest lies in 
 exploring the importance of community level factors, 
 especially social and public capital (numbers that change/things that change), in the 
 participation in and returns to income-creating activities. Evidence hints that along with 
 other forms of capital, social and public capital play 
 an important role in household income-generation. 
 For example, an analysis of Tanzanian families 
 shows that higher levels of respect are related to greater levels of expense (Narayan and 
 Pritchett, 1999). Understanding the role of social and 
 public capital in income generation has important 
 policy effects/results/suggestions for governments. If governments 
 decide to invest useful things/valuable supplies into helping poorness, 
 it is very important to know how social and public capital influence income generation. Incorporating social 
 capital and community level (numbers that change/things that change) representing 
 public capital into the analysis of valuable things and activities 
 has proved filled with problems since these valuable things are usually hard to measure in a way that truly represents 
 the clearly stated/particular attributes of these valuable things and reflects how 
 families secure benefits from them. We face/deal with 
 this issue by using factor analysis to identify specific 
 factors to represent social and public capital. 
 The rest of this paper is divided into four sections. Section 2 provides a idea-based background for 
 the relationship between valuable things, activities and income 
 and discusses the scientific plan for examining the 
 use of valuable things in income-creating activities. Section 
 3 uses the Mexico data to define the set of valuable things (away from cities) 
 Mexican household use for creating income. Participation in activities and returns to valuable things are examined 
 using the Taylor and Yunez-Naude (2000) scientific 
 approach. In Section 4, the issue of measuring and including social and public capital is talked to/looked at. Measures of these valuable things, calculated using factor analysis, 
 are then included in the activity equations. Finally, in 
 Section 5 ends/end results are discussed. 
 
 2. (away from cities) job plans: idea-based 
 (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) and scientific approach 
 The basis of a job plan is the valuable thing position of the household at a given point in time. Note 
 
 P Winters et al. I Farming-based Money flow 27 (2002) 139-156 
 
 that, as has become standard practice, household valuable things 
 are defined broadly to include natural, physical, human, (money-related), public, household and respect. 1 
 These valuable things are stocks, which may (lower in value) over 
 time or may be expanded through investment. Based 
 on access to a particular set of valuable things for a given period, the household must decide which activities it 
 will employ and the strength of involvement in that 
 activity. For purposes of this paper, activities are actions taken by the household to produce income. They 
 involve the use of a single valuable thing or a set of valuable things. 
 Farming-based production, for example, may use natural 
 capital in the form of land and water, workers, 
 physical capital such as tractors, (money-related) capital for 
 the (instance of buying something for money) of inputs and respect in the form 
 of labour help by community members. Or, non-farm wage employment may only use workers. The strength of an activity depends on 
 the degree to which valuable things are used. A plan of farming-based (process by which something becomes stronger or worse) is likely to involve a greater 
 use of workers and (money-related) capital (for the (instance of buying something for money) of inputs) than a plan that focuses on other 
 activities or in less intensive farming-based production. 
 The decision on the set of activities a household will 
 employ and the strength of those activities is conditioned on the big picture  in which the household operates. 
 The big picture  influences household decisions through 
 natural forces, markets, state activity and people-related institutions. 
 Mentally, the mapping of valuable things to income 
 through activities can be viewed as almost the same as  a production process, with valuable things going along with/matching up to factors 
 of production and income as the output of the process 
 (Barrett and Reardon, 2000). The return to valuable things depends on the limits/guidelines of the functions, which are 
 figured out by/decided by prices of inputs and outputs as well 
 as other (features/ qualities/ traits) of the big picture. The portion 
 of valuable things to each activity is expected to (make as big as possible) 
 household income subject to some restrictions. 
 Families will set apart valuable things in a manner that 
 equates the not important value product across activities 
 1 The types of capital that families access can be categorised 
 in a variety of manners. One common categorisation is to define 
 four types of capital: natural, human-made (physical), human and 
 social (Serageldin and Steer, !994). Our categorisation reflects a 
 want to provide greater detail in the types of capital used by 
 families although each of these categories can be absorbed in 
 one of the four categories commonly presented.

 or will set apart valuable things completely to one activity that has 
 a superior return. 
 One of the key features of this approach is that 
 families (at the same time) decide/figure out the portion of 
 valuable things to different activities. Failure to think about  the 
 (happening together) nature of the decision can lead to curious and often disagreeing results across different 
 studies. For example, Taylor and Yunez-Naude (2000) 
 note that research on the returns to schooling in (away from cities) 
 (processes of people making, selling, and buying things) range from high to negative. They argue 
 that the reason for this is that (people who work to find information) did not 
 take into account the (related to computers and science) changes and part/areaal (getting involved with different types of things; not sticking with only one thing) that describe farming-based change in developing countries. Families may 
 collect  the rewards from education through leaving alone (and forgetting) 
 or limiting one activity in favour of another. A low or 
 negative return to schooling in crop production, for example, may mean that the more educated have shifted 
 to other activities such as non-farm employment. (in almost the same way), this logic holds for all valuable things. If the government puts a paved road through to a community, this 
 may cause some families in that community to change  income-creating activities. (people who work to find information) focusing 
 on a single activity may find that investment in (set of machines) reduces income from that activity, which 
 may lead to mentally sick policy effects/results/suggestions. While this 
 may be the case, analysis of a single activity ignores 
 the benefits of (set of machines) in other activities. Only 
 through (thinking about/when one thinks about) all income-creating activities 
 (at the same time) can this problem be avoided. The issue we want to examine in this paper is the relative 
 importance of different valuable things in the activities chosen 
 by (away from cities) Mexican families, with particular focus on social and public valuable things. 
 The household's decision on the portion of valuable things 
 across activities is a (happening together) decision and one 
 that is changed by the fact that families do not 
 necessarily participate in all possible activities. Some 
 families will therefore have zero income from, for 
 example, self-employment. 2 Examining the portion 
 and returns to valuable things needs/demands a (happening together) equation 
 model in which the dependent income (numbers that change/things that change) are 
 changed by unobservable hidden/covered up (numbers that change/things that change) influencing 
 2 Table I notes the participation rates for each activity. Less than 
 half of families participate in non-farming-based wage employment, farming-based wage employment, self-employment and traveling.

 the activity participation decision. Families get 
 income from an activity only if they participate in that 
 activity. Participation in an income-creating activity 
 happens if the household believes the expected returns 
 to that activity are greater than the other choice of not 
 participating. 
 The econometric approach follows Lee's (big statement based on very little information) of an guess way of thinking/basic truth/rule of Amemiya 
 (1977a,b) in a general (happening together) equation model. 
 
 Lee (1978) compared Amemiya's generalised twostage estimators with other two-stage estimators, 
 and showed that Amemiya's estimators are more 
 (producing a lot with very little waste) in all cases, including those proposed by 
 Heckman. This econometric (detailed description of exactly what is required) allows for 
 changed (things that change (like test scores) because of other things that you control (like study times)), where unobservable 
 hidden/covered up (numbers that change/things that change) influence the decision to participate in 
 an activity. (not very long ago), Taylor and Yunez-Naude (2000) 
 used Lee's (big statement based on very little information) in their study of returns 
 to schooling in both crop and non-crop activities in 
 (away from cities) Mexico and we follow their scientific approach. 
 In the first step, probits using the complete set of valuable thing 
 (numbers that change/things that change) as explanatory (numbers that change/things that change) are guessed. The 
 probit on each income-creating activity measures 
 the effects of valuable things on household participation in that 
 activity. The probits are also used to calculate inverse 
 Mill's ratios (IMR), which are included in the second 
 step to control for selectivity bias. The second step is 
 to guess the income equations, including an IMR 
 as a right-hand side (number or thing that changes) in each of the similar income equations. The income equations are 
 guessed both/together, to reflect the (happening together) nature 
 of the decision, for the full household sample using 
 three stage least squares which allows the including in something 
 of information contained in the cross-equation error 
 relationships. For the income equations, only valuable things 
 that are expected to affect the income level of that 
 activity are included as right-hand side (numbers that change/things that change). 
 The data used in this study comes from a nationally 
 representative sample of Mexican ejido, or land reform, families. 3 Data were collected at two points 
 in time during the Spring and early summer of 1994 
 and 1997, for 972 families. 4 The survey covered 
 a wide organized row of household valuable things as well as household 
 3 The ejido is the land reform (machine/method/way) used by the Mexican 
 government from the 1930s to 1992. Land and water supplies 
 were granted to a community or a group of producers, or ejido, 
 with each producer getting usufruct rights over a parcel and 
 access to common lands. A 1992 (agreeing with, or related to, the Constitution) reform ended the 
 distribution of land and established a process by which individual 
 titles may be given to ejidatarios, and by which ejidos may 
 decide to (turn over from the government to private companies) individual parcels. The ejido part/area covers 
 75% of all farming-based producers in Mexico (roughly 3 million 
 families), and over half of the country's watered and rainfed 
 land. 
 4 The (office of secretaries) of Land-related Reform and the World Bank carried out the surveys with help from the University of California, Berkeley. A described/explained description of the Mexico data and 
 its sampling properties can be found in Cord et a!. (1998).

 (information about people/combinations of different kinds of people), income-creating activities and participation in organisations. Community-level data was 
 also collected on (features/ qualities/ traits) and organisation of 
 the ejido. Most of the data used in this analysis, including the income data, is from the 1997 survey except sometimes where 1994 data was used to avoid 
 endogeneity problems.

 Valuable things 
 
 3. Valuable things and income-creating activities 
 Household activities can be divided into six 
 categories: crop production, animals production, 
 self-employment, non-farming-based wage employment, farming-based wage employment and traveling. 
 Table I presents data on these activities. On average families earned 10,888 pesos in 1997. Not 
 all families participate in every activity. A majority of families participate in crop (93.7%) and 
 animals (75.3%) production but few participate in 
 self-employment (17.2%) and traveling (15.8%). 
 Farming-based activities (crops, animals and farming-based employment) make up 55% of total (away from cities) household income showing that nearly half of income is 
 created by non-farming-based activities. Crop income 
 represents about 30% of total income in 1997 and 
 is the most important source of income followed by 
 non-farming-based wage income (27 .1% ). However, only 
 42.3% of families participate in non-farming-based 
 wage employment and for those that do, it is the most 
 important income-creating activity (52.8% of total income). (in almost the same way), families that participate in 
 self-employment and traveling receive, on average, 
 one-third of their income from this activity. Some farming-based families have this way shifted away 
 from farming-based to non-farming-based activities. 
 Valuable thing ownership differs/changes significantly across the 
 ejido part/area. In Table 2, explanatory valuable things are grouped 
 into the following categories-natural (land), physical (animals, equipment), human (education, (male/female status), 
 labour, labour experience and (family and cultural characteristics)), (money-related) 
 (credit), and traveling (US and Mexico traveling networks) capital. (related to a large area) (numbers that change/things that change) are also included 
 to control for unseen factors. On average, families have much less watered land than either 
 rainfed or (area of grassy land) land. For the 25% of families 
 with watered land, average size is 5.2 ha. Although 
 overall families hold an average of 6.4 heads of

 with animals own on average 13.5 heads. Education 
 level is divided by (male/female status) as we guesse that the 
 returns to workers change/differ  by this (using different things). 
 As would be expected, the average number of male 
 and female household members decreases with increasing levels of education. Labour (combination of different substances, objects, people, etc.) and 
 experience change/differ  significantly across families.

 that activity are not especially interesting. Rainfed 
 land and animals ownership positively influence participation in animals production while watered land 
 and tractor ownership are negatively connected with 
 animals participation. This is not surprising since 
 these latter valuable things are likely to have higher returns for 
 crop production. For a almost the same  reason, tractor owners 
 are less likely to participate in self-employment. Natural and physical capital reduces participation in both 
 forms of wage employment. The strong connection 
 between rainfed land and payment income may point to/show that participation in traveling needs/demands at least 
 a (almost nothing/very little) wealth level. Education, especially among 
 males, plays a strong role in non-farming-based wage employment. (almost nothing/very little) male education, or reading and writing ability, seems 
 to play a almost the same  role in animals production. Higher 
 levels of male education are negatively connected 
 with receipt of payments. Younger families (as 
 pointed to/showed by age of household head) are more likely 
 to participate in farming-based wage employment, and 
 older families in receiving payments. The presence of young males, controlling for education, leads 
 to increased participation in farming-based wage labour, 
 while the presence of older males leads to greater 
 participation in crop production. Previous experience in non-farming-based activities (self-employment 
 and non-farming-based wage earning), as expected, 
 leads to a greater chance of participation in each 
 (pertaining to each person or thing) activity. However, previous experience in 
 farming-based wage employment leads to greater participation in crop production, farming-based wage earning 
 and traveling. Somewhat surprisingly, access to formal credit in 1994 does not influence participation 
 in any activities in 1997. This could be because 
 credit is mostly tied to crop production. Native (to) 
 families are more likely to participate in on-farm 
 activities and less likely to move. Some 
 (related to a large area) (numbers that change/things that change) are related to particular activities suggesting there are certain (related to a large area) factors that 
 influence participation that are not controlled for in 
 the moving backward. Finally, traveling networks are most 
 important for receiving payment income. 
 Table 4 presents the results of the selectivity corrected system guesses of the income equations. 
 While the probits tested the chance of participation in activities, the income equations examine 
 the factors influencing the level of income from 
 each activity. Note that in all guesses, except for 
 
 self-employment, the IMR is significant at the 95% 
 level or above. This points to/shows that self-selection into 
 activities is an important factor in (thinking about/when one thinks about) the 
 income-created from a particular activity and failure to control for this would have led to (created unfair thinking in)/(unfair-thinking) results. 
 Valuable things play a variety of roles in terms of the generation of income by activity. Land size, especially 
 watered land, is important for on-farm categories as 
 well as self-employment and payments. Rainfed 
 get is important for animals income, as it serves 
 as an input into animals production. Rainfed land is 
 also important for self-employment suggesting that 
 farmers with more land can earn more through 
 self-employment than others. Education provides the 
 most interesting story. Education is most important, 
 as expected, for non-farming-based wage labour, 
 though this differs/changes by (male/female status). All levels of male education lead to higher off-farm income, while only the 
 highest level of female education has a positive-and 
 significant-coefficient. On the other hand, the number of females (old/allowed to get old/got older) 15-34 years, holding education 
 constant, has a positive and significant effect, signalling that lower levels of female education are not 
 valued on the labour market. This is probably due 
 to the kind of entry level employment (away from cities) women 
 can choose from, such as domestic servant. Female 
 education is also important for self-employment income, and surprisingly, animals income. Both higher 
 levels of male and female education are connected 
 with higher farming-based income, suggesting that education only becomes important when it reaches a 
 certain technical level. 
 
 4. Adding social and public capital 
 The purpose of this section is to discuss a method 
 for including community (numbers that change/things that change), including social and public capital, in the analysis of 
 income-creating activities and to present the results 
 of the analysis. There has been some debate over 
 the exact definition and measure of respect 
 (Woolcock and Narayan, 2000). Respect can 
 be defined as a variety of different things/businesses with two 
 common elements: they all consist of some aspect of 
 social structure and they help actions of actors 
 within that structure (Coleman, 1988). For our purposes, respect makes up/is equal to the social relations, 
 both up-and-down and flat/left-and-right, that help help the 
 
 P. Winters et al./ Farming-based Money flow 27 (2002) 139-156 
 
 generation of income. Since our interest is in examining the community factors that help income generation, we focus on relations at that level. Families 
 may belong to a set of formal and informal organisations that may provide direct or indirect help 
 in money-based activities. For example, membership in a 
 women's group may provide information on market 
 opportunities for non-farm products. In addition to 
 membership in individual organisations, the ejidos in 
 which families live may be well or poorly organised which will also affect the families' ability to 
 create income. Finally, up-and-down ties to, for example, 
 organisations that provide technical help will 
 influence income-generation. Each of these is carefully thought about/believed as part of respect. Another valuable thing that 
 is hard to measure and plays an important role in 
 income generation is public capital, which involves 
 access to public products (that are bought and sold)  and services. These include a 
 range of services and (set of machines) from health care 
 and telephone access to electricity and paved roads. 
 Calculating the value of social and public capital 
 is complicated by the (many different kinds of people or things) and variety of indicators. Families belong to a range of organisations both formal and informal and ejidos may have 
 different types of organisational structure. (set of machines) and services differ in terms of their presence and 
 importance in a community. Table 5 lists a variety of 
 community (numbers that change/things that change) that may be used as public and 
 respect indicators. They range from measures of 
 ejido organisation and household participation in organisations to the distance to different public services,

 the level of community (set of machines) and direct household access to publicly given infrastructure. 
 The challenge for analysing the benefits of social 
 and public capital in income-creating activities is 
 deciding/figuring out a method for using the information contained in this large set of (numbers that change/things that change). Two options have 
 generally been used. The first is to create a single 
 number-based index that is a weighted average of the 
 (connected/related) set of (numbers that change/things that change). A higher value for the index 
 hints, for example, greater respect. The index 
 is then used in later analysis such as moving backward 
 analysis of income generation. Narayan and Pritchett 
 (1999) use this approach to examine household income generation in (away from cities) Tanzania. The problem with 
 this approach is that it needs/demands strong and somewhat 
 random ideas (you think are true) about the weights for each 
 (number or thing that changes) in the grouping. What's more, this method 
 assumes that a single number-based index is (good) enough to 
 represent social or public capital. However, as with 
 other forms of capital, social and public capital are 
 not (a mixture of things that are all pretty much the same) things/businesses. The World Bank (2000), for 
 example, identifies three types of respect: (gluing or joining together/friendship forming), bridging and linking. A single index ignores this 
 possibility. Even if many indexes were to be created to measure the different types of social or public 
 capital, defining the different indexes would still be 
 random. 
 The second approach to including social and public 
 capital (numbers that change/things that change) in income analysis is to use all or 
 a subset of the (numbers that change/things that change) directly in income (moving backwards). For example, De Janvry and Sadoulet (2001) 
 in testing the (things that decide other things) of income in the ejido 
 part/area include social and institutional valuable things (native (to) household and access to technical help) 
 and locational (features/ qualities/ traits) (number of city-based  centres within 1 h, number of (away from cities) centres within an 
 hour and (related to a large area) dummies). One problem with this 
 approach is in deciding which (numbers that change/things that change) well enough 
 represent the presence of social and public capital. 
 Which (number or thing that changes) in Table 5, for example, represents 
 the level of (set of machines) in a community? The problem with including all or even a lot of 
 of (numbers that change/things that change) in moving backward analysis is that this (detailed description of exactly what is required) can lead to problems with degrees of freedom, 
 if the sample is not (good or well enough) large, and multicolinearity if, as is likely, the multiple social and public 
 capital (numbers that change/things that change) are highly related. In the presence 
 of multicolinearity, identification is not a problem 
 
 but with highly related (numbers that change/things that change) guesses are less 
 exact (Greene, 1997). 
 Given the faults/problems of these two methods in 
 this paper, a third method, factor analysis, is used to 
 incorporate social and public capital into the analysis 
 of income generation. The first (or most important) purpose of factor 
 analysis is to describe the relationships among many 
 (numbers that change/things that change) in terms of a few hidden (under), but unobservable, factors (Johnson and Wichern, 1988). Factor 
 analysis groups sets of (numbers that change/things that change) by their relationships 
 and each group of (numbers that change/things that change) represents a single hidden (under) construct or factor. 5 For example, Kline 
 and Wichelns (1996) use factor analysis to test 
 people who responded' perceptions of farmland preservation 
 programs. Based on reasons gave/given for preserving 
 farmland, they identify four factors that seem to explain preferences: (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) goals, beauty-related 
 goals, land-related goals and anti-growth goals. (in almost the same way), using the many measures of social 
 and public capital, the hidden (under) factors that represent the important (features/ qualities/ traits) of these valuable things can 
 be serious and stubborn. In one such study, Onyx and Bullen 
 (2000), using a set of 36 measures of respect 
 from five Australian communities, identify eight factors that represent respect including community 
 participation, (service business/government unit/power/functioning) and trust. While factor analysis 
 does help in identifying hidden (under) factors represented by a set of (numbers that change/things that change), the method is (not definite) 
 and needs/demands (understanding/ explanation) of the factors to give them 
 meaning. This (understanding/ explanation) depends on previous knowledge and gut feeling about hidden (under) relationships. 
 For this study, factor analysis was used to identify 
 factors that represent the important elements of social 
 and public capital. Social and public capital are not 
 necessarily (group of things that are all pretty much the same) and more than one factor 
 was expected to come out  for each set of (numbers that change/things that change). Social and public capital (numbers that change/things that change) were analysed using 
 the principal part-related factor method and rotated 
 using the varimax rotation method. 6 Usually, factors 
 5 Factor analysis is just like principal parts/pieces analysis 
 in that both are tries to come close to the covariance matrix. 
 However, factor analysis is more detailed and the first (or most important) question 
 it tries to ask is whether the data are agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with some 
 hidden (under) structure (Johnson and Wichern, 1988). 
 6 As recommended as a first step by Johnson and Wichern 
 (1988). Added/more methods including the cycled-through principal factor 
 method and the maximum chance factor method were examined. Since these approaches tended to bring about almost the same  solutions the original principal parts/pieces factor method was used.

 are kept/held in the analysis if their eigenvalues are 
 greater than one. To limit the number of factors kept/held the cut-off value was increased to 1.25, which 
 allows for a more plain/honest/easy (understanding/ explanation) of 
 factors. Even with this limitation, as will be seen 
 below, understanding/explaining some of the factors is hard. 
 At that cut-off, eight factors were kept/held which 
 represented 44% of the variance. 7 Results of the factor analysis are presented in Table 6. As is standard 
 practice, only factor loadings greater than 0.25 are 
 kept/held for (understanding/ explanation). 8 
 
 4.1. Factor 1: closeness 
 This factor points to/shows the closeness of the community to (set of machines), services and city-based  areas. This is 
 proven true by the high negative loadings on distance to 
 a health clinic ( -0.45), post office ( -0.84), telegraph 
 ( -0.80) and a fax ( -0.88), and the time ( -0.76) and 
 distance to an city-based  centre ( -0.84). Families with 
 a strong connection with this factor tend to be less remote than those negatively connected with this factor. 
 
 4.2. Factor 2: ejido population size 
 This factor is related to ejidos that have a big population, which exists along with access to 
 big community services and (set of machines). The 
 strong connections with DICONSA and LICONSA 
 stores, 9 as well as with the presence of a meeting 
 room, a secondary school and a high school show this. 
 The negative associations with distance to a health centre and to a post office also point to/show a large community 
 with access to those services. The negative association 
 with PROCEDE changes and the strong connection 
 with (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) worsening are indicators of the 
 co-operation problems connected with having a large 
 7 This goes along with the 49% of the variance explained by the 
 eight factors identified by Onyx and Bullen (2000). 
 8 While only one set of results is presented, some methods 
 of factor analysis were explored. Although the order of the factors 
 differed across method, the results were mostly the same across 
 methods. That is, the loadings and relevance of certain (numbers that change/things that change) 
 tended to be the same across methods suggesting these factors do 
 represent some hidden (under) structure in the data. 
 9 LICONSA is a federal program that provides give money tod milk 
 to very poor families, city-based  and (away from cities), with children under 
 12 years of age, and tortillas to very poor families, city-based 
 and (away from cities).

 ejido-difficulty in organising the reform process and 
 difficulty in managing the useful thing/valuable supply base. 
 
 4.3. Factor 3: semi-city-based 
 This factor appears to represent ejidos that are 
 semi-city-based. The number of city-based  centres within an 
 hour has a large coefficient (0.62) as does the number 
 of (away from cities) centres within an hour (0.35). Because of this, it is not 
 surprising to see a strong connection with share of 
 roads that are paved, DICONSA store, meeting room, 
 secondary school and telephone access. An ejido near 
 an city-based  or (away from cities) centre is more likely to have greater 
 (set of machines) and services. There is also a positive 
 association with the PROCEDE reform. Since this 
 reform leads to the portion of individual property 
 rights, it is likely to be the case that the reform process will happen in areas where land can be more easily 
 sold or rented, as is generally the case in semi-city-based 
 areas. Finally, there is a positive relationship with 
 informal organisation participation. Again this could 
 be connected with a semi-city-based  setting where (groups of people/animals/things) tend to be denser and organising for cultural 
 and money-based reasons is easier. 
 
 4.4. Factor 4: co-operation 
 This factor clearly represents co-operation within 
 the ejido as proven true by the strong loading on families often participating in (groups of people/devices made up of smaller parts) (0.72), respecting community agreements (0.71) and belonging 
 to informal organisations (0.40). 
 
 4.5. Factor 5: lack of formal production 
 arrangements 
 This factor describes the lack of formal production 
 organisation in the ejido, as there is a strong negative association with an ejido belonging to an ARIC 10 
 ( -0.63). What's more, a big number of families connected with this factor do not participate in 
 'other' formal organisations ( -0.54), production contracts ( -0.48) and the government technology move (from one place to another) program ( -0.48). There is a somewhat weird 
 10 ARIC, the Spanish (word made up from the first letters of words) for (away from cities) Associations of Total Interests, are organisations of ejidos that (help increase/show in a good way) common 
 goals.

 loadings on water (0.46), sewage (0.75), bathrooms 
 (0.72) and telephone (0.48) access. Families positively connected with this factor also tend to have a 
 lower share of people/of the group speaking an native (to)
