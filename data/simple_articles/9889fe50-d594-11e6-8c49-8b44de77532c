 ABSTRACT 
 The goal of this paper is to test the guess that farmer perceptions of technology-clearly stated/particular (features/ qualities/ traits) significantly condition technology adoption decisions. Earlier 
 adoption studies have not thought about/believed this in the analysis of the (things that decide other things) of adoption 
 decisions. The (something left out) of farmers' test of technology-clearly stated/particular attributes may bias the 
 results of factors conditioning adoption choices. 
 A Tobit model was used to test this guess using a layered random sample of 124 
 mangrove swamp rice farmers in Sierra Leone. The issue (examined closely) is the adoption of 
 improved mangrove swamp rice varieties. The guessed model results show that farmer 
 perceptions of the technology-clearly stated/particular attributes of the varieties are the major factors 
 deciding/figuring out adoption and use strengths. Indicators of adoption (things that decide other things) usually/(in the past) 
 used in adoption-diffusion studies were found not to be important in driving adoption 
 decisions. Therefore, there is need for adoption studies to think about  farmers' perceptions of 
 technology-clearly stated/particular attributes in the test of technology adoption decisions.

 groups of ways of thinking for explaining adoption decisions can be found in the 
 books: the invention of new things-diffusion, and the money-based restriction ways of thinking. 
 The invention of new things-diffusion model, following from the work of Rogers, 
 holds that access to information about an invention of new things is the important thing 
 deciding/figuring out adoption decisions (for a good review see Argarwal, 1983). 
 The appropriateness of the invention of new things is taken as given, and the problem 
 of technology adoption is reduced to communicating information on the 
 technology to the possible end users. By focusing on the use of extension, 
 media and local opinion leaders or by the use of experiment station visits 
 and on-farm trials the 'skeptic' non-adopters can be shown that it is 
 clear to adopt. 
 The money-based restriction model (Aikens et al., 1975) argues that 
 money-based restrictions reflected in (not mirror-images) distribution patterns of 
 useful thing/valuable supply gifts are the major (things that decide other things) of watched/followed adoption 
 behavior. Lack of access to capital (Places and Flinn, 1976) or land (Yapa 
 and Mayfield, 1978) could significantly hold back adoption decisions. While 
 attempts have been made to defend/express the 'superiority' of the money-based 
 restriction model over the invention of new things-diffusion model (Hooks et al., 1983), 
 such ends/end results have been challenged (Nowak, 1987). 
 A third way of thinking, which we will  call the 'adopter perception' way of thinking 
 (Kivlin and Fliegel, 1966a,b, 1967) - the least (numbers-based) developed in 
 the books - makes up/is equal to the focus of this paper. The idea, which is 
 now being completely/in a hinting way used in one form or the other in the farming-based 
 money flow/money-based studies books (Gould et al., 1989; Norris and Batie, 1987; Lynne et 
 al., 1988), hints that the perceived attributes of inventions of new things condition 
 adoption behavior. The limited (numbers-based) studies that have thought about/believed 
 farmers' perceptions in the big picture  of adoption decisions (e.g. Gould et al., 
 1989; Norris and Batie, 1987), have included a perception (number or thing that changes) measuring farmers' perception of a problem (e.g. soil wearing away) - in their 
 models. However, by being concerned mostly with only the farmers' 
 perceptions (related to/looking at/thinking about) the extreme harshness of the problem to be solved, the studies 
 completely/in a hinting way take the technical inventions of new things (designed to solve the problem) as 
 appropriate for farmers. 
 Therefore, a gap exists in the adoption books: How do farmers' 
 perceptions of the technology-clearly stated/particular attributes themselves condition 
 adoption decisions? Farmers have (not definite) preferences for technology 
 (features/ qualities/ traits) (Ashby and Sperling, 1992; Ashby et al., 1989) and these 
 could play big parts in technology adoption. Adoption (rejection) of 
 technologies by farmers may reflect clear decision making based upon 
 farmers' perceptions of the appropriateness (inappropriateness) of the 
 (features/ qualities/ traits) of the technologies under (act of asking questions and trying to find the truth about something). By extending the 
 analysis to cover the attributes of the technology that may condition

 adoption behavior, ex-post adoption studies could further increase their 
 utility for directing appropriate technology development plans. 
 Therefore, the goal of this paper is to test the guess that 
 farmer perceptions of technology-clearly stated/particular (features/ qualities/ traits) significantly explains technology adoption decisions. It is argued that the (something left out) of such 
 (numbers that change/things that change) in adoption models may bias the results on the factors deciding/figuring out adoption decisions of farmers. The particular case examined in the paper 
 is farmers' adoption decisions (related to/looking at/thinking about) modern mangrove swamp rice 
 varieties in Sierra Leone. The rest of the paper is divided into five sections. 
 Section 2 gives an summary of the adoption of modern mangrove swamp 
 rice varieties in Sierra Leone. Section 3 discusses the idea-based model, 
 while Section 4 presents the scientific model. Section 5 discusses the 
 scientific results, and the paper ends in Section 6 with ends/end results. 
 2. MODERN MANGROVE SWAMP RICE VARIETIES IN SIERRA LEONE 
 
 The mangrove rice ecology stretches about 1.2 million hectares in West 
 Africa, out of which over 200 000 ha are now under (producing crops/helping something grow) in 
 Guinea-Bissau, Gambia, Guinea, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria. Mangrove swamps are located on the tidal rivers close to the ocean. They 
 are hard  (surrounding conditions) for growing rice, especially during the dry 
 season, when salts deposited by the tidal flows are not easily washed off the 
 land. Rice growing is restricted to the rainy season when the rains flush salt 
 from the soil. The rice growing period is directly related to the distance of 
 the rice helping grow areas from the sea. The length of the salt-free period 
 increases with increasing distance away from the sea. Three mangrove rice 
 growing zones can be distinguished depending on the length of time of the 
 salt-free periods: (1) short season zone: with salt-free periods of less than 4 
 months; (2) medium growing season zone: with salt-free periods of 4-6 
 months; and (3) long growing season zone: with salt-free periods of more 
 than 6 months. 
 Over 3000 mangrove rice varieties and lines (both local germplasm and 
 crosses with introduced lines) have been screened and 17 high-cooperating with/producing/giving up 
 varieties have been recommended to farmers in West Africa (WARDA, 
 1989). Some these modern mangrove rice varieties are high-cooperating with/producing/giving up, 
 fit the different salt-free growing periods, and show tolerance to some 
 major pests and sicknesses such as blast, stem borers and crabs (WARDA, 
 1989). The modern mangrove swamp rice varieties that were (examined closely) in 
 this study (i.e. ROK 5, ROK 10, Kuatik Kundur and CP 4) were introduced 
 into Sierra Leone through group/(working well together) research between the Sierra Leone 
 Rice Research Station and the West Africa Rice Development Association. 
 ROK 5 is a short-length of time variety ( &amp;lt; 4 months), Kuatik Kundur is a

 medium length of time variety (4-6 months); ROK 10, ADNY-301 and CP-4 are 
 long season varieties ( &amp;gt; 6 months). The adoption patterns of the modern 
 varieties (Table 1) show that in the Great Scarcies study zone, these 
 varieties have met with long/big adoption among farmers. The percent of 
 farmers adopting improved varieties increased from 5% in 1986 to 52% in 
 1990. ROK 5, ROK 10 and Kuatik Kundur had been adopted by 20%, 16% 
 and 16% of farmers, (match up each pair of items in order), in 1990. The area helped grow under 
 improved varieties rose from 11% in 1988 to 21% in 1990. 
 3. CONCEPTUAL MODEL 
 
 Following Rahm and Huffman (1984), farmers' adoption decisions on 
 the modern mangrove rice varieties are assumed to be based upon utility 
 (biggest increase/best possible extent). Define the varietal technologies by j, where j = 1 for the 
 new technology and j = 2 for the old technology. The non-(capable of being seen and known) 
 hidden (under) utility function which ranks the preference of the ith farmer is 
 given by U(Mji- A j). So, the utility derivable from the varietal technology depends on M which is a vector of farm and farmer-clearly stated/particular attributes 
 of the adopter and A which is a vector of the attributes connected with the 
 technology. Although the utility function is unseen, the relation between the utility derivable from a jth technology is said to be a 
 function of the vector of watched/followed farm, farmer particular (features/ qualities/ traits) (e.g., 
 farm size, age, experience of farmer), and the technology specific (typical and expected) (e.g., yield, taste, tillering ability (to hold or do something) etc) and a disturbance term having 
 a zero mean: 
 j=1,2;i=1, ... ,n 
 (1) 
 
 301 
 
 TOBIT MODEL APPLICATION IN SIERRA LEONE 
 
 Equation (1) does not restrict the function F to be linear. As the utilities 
 are random, the ith farmer will select the different j = 1 if Uli &amp;gt; U2 i 
 or if the non-(capable of being seen and known) (hidden/covered up) random (number or thing that changes) y * = Uli - U2 i &amp;gt; 0. The 
 chance that Â¥; equals one (i.e., that the farmer adopts an improved rice 
 variety) is a function of the (things that you control (like study times), that cause other things to change (like test scores)):

 a 1 )]_) 
 
 =Pr(&#126;ti&amp;gt; -Fi(Mi, Ai)/3) 
 = 
 
 (2) 
 
 Fi(Xi/3) 
 
 where X is the n X k matrix of the explanatory (numbers that change/things that change), and f3 is a k X 1 
 vector of limits/guidelines to be guessed, Pr( Â·) is a chance function, ILi is 
 an random error term, and F(Xif3) is the total amount of distribution function 
 for ILi tested at Xi/3. The chance that a farmer will adopt the 
 modern mangrove rice variety is a function of the vector of explanatory 
 (numbers that change/things that change) and of the unknown limits/guidelines and error term. For all practical 
 purposes, equation (2) cannot be guessed directly without knowing the 
 form of F. It is the distribution of ILi that decides/figures out the distribution of F. 
 If lti is (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy), F will have a total (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) distribution (Rahm and 
 Huffman, 1984). 
 Following equation (2) the functional form of F is specified with a Tobit 
 model, where lti is an independently, (usually/ in a common and regular way) distributed error term with 
 zero mean and constant variance a 2 : 
 
 Â¥; =Xi/3

 + ILi &amp;gt; T

 where y; is the chance of adopting (and the strength of use of) the 
 modern mangrove rice varieties; i* is a non-(capable of being seen and known) hidden/covered up (number or thing that changes), and 
 T is a non-watched/followed dividing line level. 
 The Tobit model (Tobin, 1958) therefore measures not only the chance that a mangrove rice farmer will adopt the new variety but also the 
 strength of use of the technology once adopted. So, equation (3) is a 
 (happening together) and (random/including random data points) decision model. If the non-watched/followed hidden/covered up 
 changeable i* is greater than T, the watched/followed (not numbers-based) changeable yi that 
 indexes adoption becomes a continuous function of the explanatory (numbers that change/things that change), and 0 otherwise. (i.e. no adoption). In cases where (in a big way) large 
 numbers of decision makers have completely adopted the technology, a 
 version of the one-limit Tobit model in equation (3) (i.e. a 2-limit Tobit 
 proposed by Rossett and Nelson (1975)), could be used (e.g. Gould et al., 
 
 302 
 
 A.A. ADESINA AND M.M. ZINNAH 
 
 1989). Such an application of the Tobit analysis is, however, not appropriate for this study as only seven farmers (or 3% of the people who responded) had 
 completely adopted the improved rice varieties on all their total cropped 
 area. The use of the one-limit Tobit model in this study is agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with 
 other earlier studies (Akinola and Young, 1985; Shakya and Flinn, 1985; 
 Norris and Batie, 1987). 
 4. EMPIRICAL MODEL 
 
 The data on which the scientific model is based were collected in 
 1990-1991 during an intensive 6-month village level survey of a layered 
 random sample of 124 mangrove swamp rice farmers in the Great Scarcies 
 area of Sierra Leone. The guessed scientific model, came/coming from equation (1) to equation (3), was developed using the farm and farmer specific 
 attributes and farmer perception (numbers that change/things that change) (related to/looking at/thinking about) technology specific 
 (features/ qualities/ traits) of the modern varieties. The (thing that changes (like a test score) because of something else that you control (like study time)) is the 
 proportion of the total varietal (mix of stocks, bonds, etc./document collection) mix (i.e. local and improved 
 varieties) that created/made up by improved varieties The definitions and 
 measurements, and the sample (features/ qualities/ traits) of the (numbers that change/things that change) are given in 
 Table 2 and Table 3, (match up each pair of items in order). Further details are available in other places 
 (Zinnah, 1992). 
 The attribute vector A in equation (1) was specified in the scientific 
 model to include the following (numbers that change/things that change): taste, yield, ease of cooking, 
 tillering ability (to hold or do something) and the ease of beating/separating the collected rice. Taste is an 
 important attribute desired by rice farmers, especially since rice is mainly 
 home-ate/destroyed in the study zone. Surveys in other parts of West Africa 
 have found that taste of rice was referred to/was given a ticket as an important feature  desired by rice 
 people (Adewusi et al., 1991). Ease of cooking of rice is directly linked 
 to chemical (typical and expected) of the rice grain (i.e. the gelatinization temperature). Varieties having high gelatinization temperatures take longer periods 
 to cook (Unnevehr, 1986; Adewusi et al., 1991). Such a feature  should be 
 important to mangrove swamp rice farmers given that fuel-wood supply is 
 very much limited along the mangrove swamps. Women and children in 
 mangrove swamp rice helping grow families (especially those closer to the 
 sea) often have to travel a few kilometers by boats in search of fuel-wood 
 in the upland zones. It is guessed that ease of cooking is positively 
 related to adoption. 
 Ease of beating/separating is guessed to be positively related to adoption. 
 The usual methods of beating/separating rice are highly labor intensive and 
 consist of either pounding the collected paddy with sticks or with the only 
 of the feet. Therefore, varieties that are easier to thresh are more likely to 
 be preferred by farmers. Tillering ability of rice is important to mangrove 
 swamp farmers, as they link this with tolerance to crab damage, a major

 problem to young rice seedlings in mangrove rice ecologies (WARDA, 
 1989). Varieties with high tillering ability (to hold or do something) still give good yields (even though there is the existence of) 
 crab damage, especially due to the re-growth of new tillers. It is guessed that tillering ability (to hold or do something) is positively related to chance of adoption. 
 The perceived superior yield performance of modern rice variety is 
 expected to be related to adoption and use strengths. On-farm trials in the 
 study zone show that the modern varieties have significantly out-performed 
 local varieties under farmers' conditions (Adams, 1986). Therefore, it is 
 guessed that the perceived yield (quality of being better than everything else) of the modern varieties is 
 positively linked with adoption decisions. 
 The farm and farmer clearly stated/particular factors included in the model (i.e. vector 
 M) are based on invention of new things diffusion explanation and earlier studies. These 
 include age of the farmer; farm size; participation in on-farm mangrove 
 rice trials; contact with extension agents and the years of experience since 
 the farmer became an owner of a mangrove rice farm. The last thing just mentioned is to be 
 (told apart from/separate than) general farming experience. General farming experience is not (connected/related) for the scientific model since most farmers judge their 
 total experience as starting from the first day that they started going out 
 with their parents to the mangrove rice fields. What is important is the 
 experience since the farmer became a decision maker on his own field 
 (Mueller and Jansen, 1988). 
 Farm size has been shown to positively affect adoption decisions (Polson 
 and Spencer, 1991; Akinola, 1987; Norris and Batie, 1987). Therefore, it is 
 guessed that the sign on this (number or thing that changes) in the scientific model is 
 positive. Studies have shown that age of the farmer is related to adoption 
 decisions. Younger farmers have been found to be more full of knowledge 
 about new practices and may be more willing to bear risk due to their 
 longer planning horizons (Bultena and Hoiberg, 1983; Gould et al., 1989; 
 Polson and Spencer, 1991). Following earlier scientific findings, the maintained guess is that age is negatively related to adoption. 
 Contact with extension agents is expected to have a positive effect on 
 adoption based upon the invention of new things-diffusion explanation. Such contacts, by 
 exposing farmers to availability of information can be expected to stimulate 
 adoption (Polson and Spencer, 1991; Voh, 1982; Osuntogun et al., 1986; 
 Kebede et al., 1990). Years of experience in mangrove swamp rice farming 
 is expected to be related to the ability of the farmer to get, process, and 
 use information clearly connected with or related to (producing crops/helping something grow) under this rice ecology. A positive 
 relationship is guessed between this (number or thing that changes) and the chance of 
 adoption of modern swamp rice varieties. Participation in on-farm experimental trials on mangrove rice is an 'exposure variable' and is guessed 
 to be positively related to adoption. 
 Three differences/different versions of the scientific model were guessed: (1) using only

 5. EMPIRICAL RESULTS 
 
 When only the farm and farmer particular (features/ qualities/ traits) are carefully thought about/believed 
 (model 1), none of these (numbers that change/things that change) are significant at 0.05 importance level. 
 However, at the 0.10 importance level, participation in on-farm tests and 
 contacts with extension agents are significant in explaining adoption decisions. Apart from age, all the farm and farmer clearly stated/particular (numbers that change/things that change) are 
 positively related to adoption decisions (Table 4). When only the farmer 
 perceptions of technology-clearly stated/particular (features/ qualities/ traits) are carefully thought about/believed (model 2), 
 all of the varietal clearly stated/particular qualities, except taste, were highly significant (at the 
 0.01 and 0.05 importance levels) in explaining adoption and use strengths

 of the modern rice varieties. In similarity with the maintained guesses, 
 all these varietal clearly stated/particular (numbers that change/things that change), including taste, are also positively 
 related to the chance of adoption and the strength of use of the 
 modern mangrove rice varieties (Table 5). Combining both farm and 
 farmer specific, and technology clearly stated/particular (numbers that change/things that change) (model 3), the results 
 show that none of the farm and farmer clearly stated/particular factors argued in the 
 adoption books was significant in explaining the adoption decisions of 
 modern mangrove rice varieties. Rather, farmer perceptions of the technology-clearly stated/particular qualities of these varieties have been the major factors conditioning adoption behavior (Table 6). These results, which are strong, strongly 
 confirm the maintained guesses that farmers' perceptions of attributes 
 of farming-based technologies decide/figure out watched/followed adoption choices. So, 
 past ends/end results often reported in the adoption and diffusion books 
 about how farm and farmer clearly stated/particular factors significantly affect adoption of 
 farming-based technologies were not supported by (event(s) or object(s) that prove something)s from this study. 
 The scientific model can be used to draw money-based effects/results/suggestions for

 Leone. Following a Tobit rotting (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) suggested by McDonald and Moffitt (1980), the effects of changes of the varietal clearly stated/particular qualities 
 on adoption chances and use strengths can be gotten. 
 Let the expected value of the (thing that changes (like a test score) because of something else that you control (like study time)) PROPOTN across all 
 (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) be represented as E(P), the expected value of the dependent 
 (number or thing that changes) (may or may not happen, depending on something) on the mangrove rice farmer being above the dividing line 
 limit (i.e. already an adopter and so now worried about use strengths) 
 be given as E( p ), and the chance of the farmer being above the limit 
 (i.e. the chance of adoption) be represented as F( z ), where z = X3{ j lf. 
 The relationship between these (numbers that change/things that change) can be shown to be: 
 
 E(P) = F(z) * E(p)

 A.A. ADESINA AND M.M. ZINNAH 
 
 For a given change in the level of the varietal clearly stated/particular attributes in the 
 mangrove rice breeding program, the effects on farmer adoption behavior 
 can be broken down into two parts by (making different) equation (4) with 
 respect to the specific varietal attribute change: 
 
 3E(P)j3Xi = F(z)[3E(p)j3XJ + E(p)[3F(z)j3Xi] 
 
 (5.1) 
 
 Multiplying through by XJE(P), the relation in equation (5.1) can be 
 converted into ability to stretch forms: 
 
 [3E(P)j3Xi]XJE(P) 
 
 = 
 
 F(z)[3E(p)j3Xi]XJE(P) 
 
 + E(p)[3F(z)j3Xi]XJE(P) 
 
 (5.2) 
 
 Re-arranging (5.2) by using equation (4): 
 
 [3E(P)j3Xi] XJE(P) 
 
 = 
 
 [3E(p )j3XJ XJE(p) 
 
 + [3F(z)j3XJXJF(z) 
 
 (5.3) 
 
 Therefore, total ability to stretch of a change in the level of any of the varietal 
 clearly stated/particular (features/ qualities/ traits) (which is assumed to be directly perceived by 
 farmers) consists of two effects: (a) the change in the ability to stretch of the use 
 strengths of the modern mangrove rice varieties, for those mangrove rice 
 farmers that are already adopters; and (b) the change in the ability to stretch of 
 the chance of being an adopter. 
 The figured out/calculated elasticities, using model 3, are reported in Table 7. The 
 estimates show that not important changes in the perceived technology specific 
 (features/ qualities/ traits) increases the chance of adoption of the rice varieties 
 more than it increases the use strengths. However, the ability to stretch guesses 
 show inelastic responses to changes in these (features/ qualities/ traits). Cooking quality (feature/ quality/ trait) has the highest hit/effect on the chance of adoption and 
 use strengths. The total ability to stretch value is 0.86, which is divided into 0.45 
 for the ability to stretch of adoption chance and 0.41 for the ability to stretch of use

 strength. This hints that a 10% improvement in the ease of cooking 
 (feature/ quality/ trait) is expected to result in about 9% increase in the adoption 
 and use strengths of the improved rice varieties. The chance of 
 adoption will increase by 5%, while the use strengths will increase by 4%. 
 Improving the tillering ability (to hold or do something) of modern varieties in breeding programs is 
 guessed to increase the total ability to stretch by 0.58, which is rotten into 
 0.30 for the ability to stretch of the chance of adoption and 0.28 for the 
 ability to stretch of the expected use strength. Improving the produce and the ease of 
 beating/separating (features/ qualities/ traits) are guessed to have almost the same  effects on the total 
 adoption elasticities and its' parts/pieces. In each case, the total ability to stretch 
 of 0.50 consists of 0.26 due to the ability to stretch of adoption and 0.24 (named after/discovered by/caused by) the ability to stretch of expected use strengths. 
 Breeding efforts targeted only at improving taste of the modern varieties is guessed to have little or no effect on adoption elasticities. This 
 result may point to/show that farmers are well used to the taste of their existing 
 local varieties and are more likely to judge the local varieties as better in 
 terms of taste. Anyway, research programs may wish to treat taste 
 improvement as an important part of overall breeding goals, 
 but with much limited focus compared to the previously-mentioned factors. 
 6. CONCLUSIONS 
 
 This paper showed that farmer perceptions of technology-clearly stated/particular (features/ qualities/ traits) significantly condition technology adoption decisions. The results 
 showed that the (something left out) of such (numbers that change/things that change) in adoption models may bias the 
 results of the factors deciding/figuring out adoption decisions of farmers. 
 The results strongly suggest that farmer perceptions of technologyspecific (features/ qualities/ traits) should be thought about/believed in testing the (things that decide other things) 
 of adoption decisions on farming-based technologies. Such (numbers that change/things that change) will 
 enrich the set of factors ordinarily used in adoption studies (Feder et 
 al., 1985)
