 Abstract 
 The hits/effects of the Uruguay Round policy (legal rules/food and supplies) on the world sugar market show that these policies will (make steady/make firm and strong) the world sugar 
 price at (a) little higher levels than in the (a measure of what occurs naturally/sports boundary line). Worldwide  sugar consumption will increase as a result of the income growth caused by the 
 Uruguay Round. Money-based useful things/valuable supplies will be set apart and given out (producing more with less waste)ly among the sugar businesses of the different countries. However, the 
 hits/effects on the sugar businesses in countries with strong producer supports will be rather small because the (back-and-forth conversation to agree on something) process of the 
 Uruguay Round (has changed something (to help someone)/has taken care of someone) the changes in sugar policies already put into use by individual countries in the past few years. 
 Low-cost sugar producing countries will benefit from the higher world sugar price, and people in countries with protected markets will 
 benefit from lower domestic prices. 
 
 1. Introduction 
 
 Sugar is an important valuable thing in the world 
 market with a total production of 115.79 million t, 
 consumption of 111.15 million t, and world trade 
 equal to 27% of production in 1992. Sugar is produced in more than 100 countries and is one of the 
 most heavily traded valuable things. The international 
 sugar market has a few (like nothing else) (features/ qualities/ traits) that 
 distinguish it from other valuable thing markets. Among 
 these are heavy government helping actions, large price 
 dangerous nature/wild up and down prices, (existing all over a large area) production in many parts of 
 the world, and a growing market for sugar substitutes. These features make the world sugar market a 
 rich target for policy analysis, although they also 
 present/cause (large/relatively large) modeling (problems, delays, etc.).

 Sugar is taken from sugarcane and sugarbeet. 
 Sugarcane is mostly grown in (related to areas near the Equator/hot and humid) weather and 
 poor countries, and sugarbeet is mostly grown in mild/not extreme weather and high-income 
 countries. Sugar is, therefore, produced in big 
 amounts in many parts of the world. The cost of 
 sugar production is (compared to other things) lower in the poor countries than in the high-income countries. 
 What's more, most of these countries compete directly in the world market. As a result, the developed countries in the northern (half of a globe, ball, etc.) heavily 
 protect domestic producers, often at the expense of 
 domestic people. Webb et al. (1990) guessed 
 that in 1987, 67% of sugar producers' income in 
 Japan, 60% in the United States, 54% in Canada, and 
 41% in the (related to Europe) Union was came/coming from government payments and price supports. Ives and Hurley ( 1988) noted that the US sugar programs maintain the domestic price at a much higher level than 
 the free-market price at a cost to US people of

 over $3 billion every year. Borrell and Duncan (1993) 
 also decided that the total cost to US people 
 over the 1982-1988 period was about $2.5 billion 
 every year. Roberts and Whish-Wilson (1991) guessed that the (related to Europe) Union's sugar policies during the period 1979-1989 forced on people an once-a-year understood cost on people of about $3.8 billion. Sturgiss et al. (1988) guessed that Japanese sugar policies during 1985-1987 cost the people about 
 $2.3 billion every year. 
 The sugar policies of developed countries also 
 caused significant money-based loss on poor 
 sugar exporters as these countries experienced lower 
 world prices and production, and displacement of 
 employment opportunities. For example, Borrell and 
 Duncan ( 1993) (described the future) that the combined effects 
 of the sugar policies of the United States, the (related to Europe) Union, and Japan could depress the world price 
 by 33% and increase world price (quality of changing over time or at different places) by 28%. 
 Ives and Hurley (1988) (described the future) that, because of 
 reduction in the amount/quantity of the US import quota in 
 1987, countries exporting sugar to the United States 
 got/caused a loss in export earnings of over $700 
 million every year. Borrell and Duncan (1993) also 
 provide guesses of individual exporting country's 
 losses caused by the United States, the (related to Europe) 
 Union, and Japan. (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) from such studies lead 
 Marks and Maskus (1993) to decide that: developed countries' sugar policies have ''made sugar 
 markets among the most ridiculously badly twisted/partially untrue/lied about of all 
 farming-based valuable thing markets and have caused 
 significant worldwide  welfare losses.'' 
 Because of the level of distortion in the world 
 sugar market, trade (easing government rules) resulting from the 
 Uruguay Round (UR) of the General Agreement on 
 Taxes/import taxes and Trade (GATT) should lead to a big improvement in world useful thing/valuable supply portion by 
 shifting sugar production to (producing more with less waste) areas and 
 reducing the inefficient production of com-based 
 sweeteners. For example, Sturgiss et al. ( 1987) found 
 that previous international sugar agreements to raise 
 and (make steady/make firm and strong) the world price through stock management were inefficient, but elimination of government 
 payments and other forms of helping action would improve world welfare. 
 As UR policy (legal rules/food and supplies) are used, it is 
 important for the sugar exporting and importing 
 countries to test the effects of these trade changes 
 
 on their sugar markets. The goal of this study is 
 to scientifically number the effects of the trade (easing government rules) agreements (worked to reach agreement/got through) under the UR on 
 sugar production, consumption, trade, and prices of 
 the major sugar exporting and importing countries. 
 This is good by guessing a non-(related to space or existing in space) 
 balance model of the world sugar market consisting of 21 countries/regions. For each country, important parts/pieces of supply and demand are guessed by incorporating the domestic and trade policies and modeling sugar substitutes. The results of 
 these trade (easing government rules) analyses will be useful to 
 producers and policymakers. 
 
 2. Sugar policies and UR (legal rules/food and supplies) 
 Among the reasons countries get involved and help in the 
 sugar market are (a) sugar production needs/demands a 
 huge investment; (b) producers try to maintain 
 stable prices and incomes; (c) many countries depend on 
 the sugar industry for employment opportunities; (d) 
 poor countries create foreign exchange from 
 exports; and (e) some countries chase after independence goals because sugar is widely used in many 
 products. Since UR trade changes are aimed at freedom-creating the existing domestic and trade policies, a 
 brief review of the current policies of selected countries and the effects of the UR (legal rules/food and supplies) on these 
 policies are given next. The policy reviews presented in this section are drawn from Ives and 
 Hurley (1988), Lord and Barry (1990), and Borrell 
 and Duncan (1993). The described/explained UR sugar policy 
 (legal rules/food and supplies) for different countries are reported in De" 
 vadoss and Kropf (1995). 
 2.1. The United States 
 
 The major features of the US sugar programs in 
 the 1980s were a loan rate big plan/layout/dishonest plan and an import 
 quota system. The loan rate big plan/layout/dishonest plan (promised that something will definitely happen or that something will definitely work as described) sugar 
 processors a highest price for their sugar. The 
 processors in tum passed these loan rate (promises that something will definitely happen or that something will definitely work as described) 
 to red vegetable  and cane producers by paying a fixed highest price. The loan rate was set much higher 
 than the world sugar price. The processors could 
 loss (as punishment) their stocks to the Valuable thing Credit Corporation (CCC) at the loan rate. Though loan forfei- 
 
 S. Devadoss, J. Kropf/ Farming-based Money flow 15 ( 1996) 83-96 
 
 tures could cost the US treasury, the 1985 farm 
 laws (and law making) ordered that the US program should not 
 (force (on people)/cause an inconvenient situation) money-related heavy loads on the government. This 
 order was (accomplished or gained) by maintaining a domestic 
 price higher than the loan rate and moving (from one place to another) the 
 cost of the sugar programs to people. 
 To keep processors from losing their stocks to 
 the CCC and to prevent the domestic price from 
 falling below the loan rate, import quotas were (did/done/put into law) to limit the amount of import. Until 1990, the 
 US gave out these quotas among different exporting 
 countries. In 1990, in response to pressure from 
 GATT, the United States established a tax/import tax-rate 
 quota system. Under this system, the United States 
 now puts into use a country-by-country quota 
 with a low tax/import tax of 0.625 c per lb. Imports above the 
 quota limits are charged a tax/import tax of 16 c per lb. 
 Because of the (compared to other things) high domestic prices, 
 red vegetable  and, a little bit, cane production are expanding stronger than the level desired by the US 
 government. To restrict domestic production the 
 USDA puts into use a marketing portion arrangement, which sets apart the amount of sugar the millers 
 and processors can sell in the domestic market in a 
 year. The marketing portion is triggered if the 
 USDA guesses show that for a given year the 
 projected supply will go beyond demand. Specifically, 
 the formula used by the USDA, known as marketing 
 portion import guess (MAlE), to decide/figure out the 
 portion is domestic consumption + ending stocks 
 &amp;lt; domestic production + beginning stocks + 1.250 
 million short tons. This program was used in 
 money-related years 1993 and 1995. What's more, high price 
 support policies in the United States have encouraged fast (act of something getting bigger, wider, etc.) of high fruit sugar com syrup 
 (HFCS), moving aside domestic sugar consumption. 
 The UR (legal rules/food and supplies) for farming can be broadly 
 classified under the categories: market access, domestic support, and export competition (refer to the 
 add on table in Devadoss and Kropf, 1995, for 
 specific policy reduction schedules by different countries). For the United States, the figured out/calculated value of 
 the price support program is $1054 million, and the 
 United States is expected to apply a reduction of 
 20%, resulting in $843 million in price supports. The 
 figured out/calculated sugar tax/import tax equal is 39.59 c per kg 
 (149.40%) and the needed/demanded reduction is 15%. The 
 US government has changed its sugar programs to 
 
 85 
 
 meet the UR needed thing of reducing price supports 
 and tax/import tax equals. The market access provision 
 of minimum imports does not present/ask/stand in a showy and fake way a restriction since 
 the US imports are greater than 3% of its consumption. The export competition provision does not apply to the United States because of its limited export 
 abilities. 
 2.2. The (related to Europe) Union (EU) 
 The major sugar policies of the EU include domestic production and price controls helped by changeable import levies, export payments, and production 
 controls on high fruit sugar starch syrup (HFSS). These 
 policies have led to increased sugar production. As a 
 result the EU has switched from a net sugar importer 
 to a major sugar exporter. Domestic production is 
 controlled by (controlling or managing/giving medicine or something else) A and B production 
 quotas. Under Quota A, sugar is produced to meet 
 the domestic demand. Sugar produced under Quota 
 A qualifies for the EU helping action price, an given price (in a big way) higher than the world market price. 
 Quota B also receives the domestic price support 
 but faces a higher co-responsibility levy than Quota 
 A. So, the producer price for Quota B sugar equals 
 the helping action price minus a higher levy. Quota A 
 and B sugar more than domestic consumption is 
 exported with payments, which are financed by the 
 production levies on A and B sugar. Sugar produced 
 more than these quotas, termed as C sugar, receives the world price and is sold in the world 
 market without payments. 
 What's more, the EU (controls or manages/gives medicine or something else) dividing line prices 
 and (number or thing that changes) levies to protect the domestic market 
 from sugar imports. All these policies provide big support to domestic producers, but the management of these policies is very expensive. In order 
 to pay for these policies, the EU taxes domestic 
 people by setting the price at high levels. 
 For the EU, the figured out/calculated group measurement 
 of support (AMS) is 5.3 billion ECU, and the EU is 
 expected to apply a reduction of 20%, which results 
 in anÂ· AMS of 4.2 billion ECU. To meet the AMS 
 needed thing, the EU is expected to reduce its helping action price. The figured out/calculated sugar tax/import tax equal 
 is 524 ECU per t. A 20% reduction brings the tax/import tax 
 equal to 419 ECU per t. The current import 
 
 86 
 
 S. Devadoss. J. Kropf/ Farming-based Money flow 15 ( 1996) 83-96 
 
 access of 1.9 million t, mostly imported from African, 
 Caribbean, and Pacific (ACP) countries through the 
 Lome agreement, goes beyond 3% of EU consumption, 
 and so, the import access needed thing is being met 
 by the EU. The figured out/calculated amount/quantity of paid-for 
 exports is 1.6 million t and a reduction of 21 % 
 brings these exports to 1.3 million t. A 36% reduction in the value of paid-for exports is applied 
 which causes the EU export payments to come down 
 from 777 to 497 million ECU. 
 
 2.3. Australia 
 Australia is a sugar exporting country and ranked 
 third in the world in exports from 1986 to 1988. 
 Australia grows only sugarcane and is carefully thought about/believed to 
 be a low-cost producer of sugar. Australia controls 
 its sugar industry by putting into use policies through a 
 sugar board that controls producers as well as people. 
 The sugar board assigns sugarcane areas to producers. The sugar produced in these areas is sold for 
 an (related to managers) established price. Sugar produced 
 from unassigned areas is gotten/purchased by the government 
 for a price of Aus$1 per ton, which effectively 
 prevents cane production in these areas. The returns 
 from sugar sold in the domestic and export markets 
 are combined by the sugar board and distributed to 
 producers and mills. In the past, the return from 
 exports went up and down since world sugar prices varied 
 very (much). Until 1989, domestic prices were fixed in 
 Australia and in some years were lower than the 
 world price. Since 1989, domestic prices are allowed 
 to follow the world price. The import quota, in place 
 before 1989, was replaced by a tax/import tax system which 
 liberalized the Australian sugar market. This (easing government rules) resulted in a market-serious and stubborn personal 
 price. 
 For Australia, the figured out/calculated value of the AMS for 
 sugar is Aus$64. 73 million. A reduction of 20% 
 results in an AMS of Aus$51.8 million. The figured out/calculated sugar tax/import tax equal is Aus$143 per t 
 (149.40%) and the needed/demanded reduction is 15%. 
 2.4. Brazil 
 
 Brazil is a sugar exporting country and a leading 
 producer of sugarcane. Brazil is a low-cost sugar 
 
 producer. In Brazil, sugarcane is used to produce 
 sugar and ethanol (which is a first (or most important) domestic fuel). 
 The production of both valuable things is highly controlled by a almost-government (service business/government unit/power/functioning), the Brazilian 
 Institute of Sugar and Alcohol, by giving-out once-a-year 
 quotas to farms, mills, and (big places that make gasoline, etc., from oil). 
 Brazilian sugar policies include the portion of 
 sugarcane areas into sugar and ethanol production 
 areas. For example, in 1989, the ratio of ethanol to 
 sugar production was 60 to 40%. Other policies 
 include sugar export controls and desire/decision of 
 producer and personal prices. Producer prices are 
 fixed at a level above the world price and person 
 prices are set at a level well below the world price. 
 The price controls insulate domestic producers and 
 people from the world market. Brazil's ability to 
 switch between ethanol and sugar production is restricted because of the country's high dependency on 
 ethanol production as a (motor vehicle-related) fuel. Anyway, 
 Brazil has an huge sugarcane production ability (to hold or do something) that allows the country to increase sugar production and exports in response to rising world sugar 
 prices. Production and exports are expected to increase in the future if the attempts of the Brazilian 
 government to reduce the country's ethanol dependency as a fuel source are successful. 
 For Brazil, the figured out/calculated AMS is $857 million, 
 and a reduction of 13.3% results in an AMS of $743 
 million. The sugar tax/import tax equal is reduced from 
 46 to 35%. The figured out/calculated amount/quantity of paid-for 
 exports is 791300 t, which is reduced to 601 400 t. A 
 24% reduction in the value of paid-for exports is 
 applied which causes Brazil's export payments to 
 decline from $56 000 to $43 000. 
 2.5. Japan 
 Japan is the world's third largest sugar importer, 
 importing about twice the amount of sugar 
 it produces domestically. Since Japan is a high-cost 
 sugar producer, it controls the sugar market in order 
 to secure a smallest level of domestic production. 
 These controls include producer payments and import 
 policies. Japan's producers receive a government 
 (promised that something will definitely happen or that something will definitely work as described) price that is much higher than the 
 world price. For example, in 1987 the Japanese farm 
 price was set at about 65 c per lb of raw sugar. 
 Farmers receive the (promised that something will definitely happen or that something will definitely work as described) price from proces- 
 
 S. Devadoss, J. Kropf/ Farming-based Money flow 15 ( 1996) 83-96 
 
 sors who, in tum, sell the raw sugar to a government-established corporation for a higher price and 
 buy the valuable thing back from this corporation for a 
 lower price. So, the government provides helping payment 
 to processors and producers. To support these payments and maintain a stable market price, Japan establishes high fixed and (number or thing that changes) levies on sugar imports. In 1987, duties, excise taxes, and changeable 
 levies amounted to 31 c per lb of imported sugar, 
 which raised the final price for the imports to 41 c 
 per lb. Japanese people also add/give to the 
 money/money income by paying higher domestic sugar prices, 
 which results in a (compared to other things) low per-person use. Japan's policies also encourage HFCS consumption. 
 For Japan, the figured out/calculated value of the AMS for 
 sugarcane production is 88 billion desire, and a reduction of 20% calls for an AMS of 71 billion desire. The 
 figured out/calculated sugar tax/import tax equal is 41.5 desire  per kg 
 and a reduction of 15% brings the tax/import tax equal to 
 35.3 desire  per kg. Japan does not face the import 
 access needed thing because of its large amount/quantity of 
 sugar imports. (in almost the same way), the export competition (legal rules) do not apply to Japan because it does not 
 export sugar. 
 Though the other countries and areas included 
 in the model chase after helping action policies, these policies and the similar UR (legal rules/food and supplies) are not 
 discussed here because of space limits. However, 
 these policies are incorporated in the analysis. 
 
 3. Scientific model 
 
 A non-(related to space or existing in space) balance world sugar model consisting of 21 countries/regions is used for the analysis. The exporting countries/regions included in the model are Australia, Brazil, Cuba, the (related to Europe) 
 Union, India, South Africa, Thailand, other Central 
 America, and other South America. The importing 
 countries/regions are the United States, Canada, 
 Japan, Mexico, Indonesia, China, the Former Soviet 
 Union, Eastern Europe, other Western Europe, other 
 Asia, other Africa, and the rest of the world (ROW). 
 This large-scale model allows us to includes 
 the influence of domestic and trade policies on production, consumption, stocks, and trade. What's more, including government helping action 
 
 87 
 
 policies enables us to correctly take by force/take control of the effects 
 of trade (easing government rules). The model includes the energetic behavior of the sugar market, which captures 
 the changes/recalculations in the endogenous (numbers that change/things that change) over 
 time in response to policy changes. The influence of 
 macroeconomic (numbers that change/things that change) (exchange rates, interest 
 rates, inflation rates, and GNP) and time falls behind  in 
 production are also clearly modelled. 
 Data for production, consumption, exports, imports, and ending stocks are received/got from the Money-based Research Service and from the Foreign Farming-based Service of the US Department of Farming. Data for area collected, yield, and extraction 
 rates are received/got from the Food and Farming-based 
 Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. Macroeconomic data such as income, population, exchange 
 and inflation rates are received/got from the International Money-based Fund (IMF). The guess period 
 includes the years 1970 to 1992. 
 For each country, functional relationships for supply and demand parts/pieces and price linkage equations are guessed. The guess of the supply side 
 consists of sugarcane or sugarbeet area planted and a 
 total sugar production equation that is the product of 
 the area planted, the extraction rate, and the yield. 
 The supply functions incorporate the domestic policies chased after by different countries. The guess of 
 the demand parts/pieces consists of sugar consumption and ending stocks. If countries chase after domestic 
 policies that tax the people by making them pay 
 a higher domestic price than the world price, then the 
 domestic price is used to guess the consumption 
 functions. The price linkage equation links the domestic price to the world price. The wedge between 
 the domestic price and the world price reflects the 
 effects of trade policies conducted by a country. For 
 each country, the net excess demand or excess supply is received/made from and the world market clearing is 
 established by equating the net import demand of all 
 importers and the net export supply of all exporters. 
 The model includes a great many details such 
 as including in something of a large number of country-level disaggregations and the modeling of HFCS, incorporation of domestic and trade policies, including in something of 
 macroeconomic factors, and accounting for (like nothing else) 
 production (features/ qualities/ traits). A difficult/strict/high quality analysis can be 
 conducted, therefore, to correctly guess the effects of trade libera,lizations.

 The cross prices include wheat for US red vegetable, cotton for US cane, wheat for Australia and Canada, and ethanol for Brazil. 
 
 The model includes a total of 82 endogenous 
 equations and 21 market-clearing equations, which 
 decide/figure out 103 endogenous (numbers that change/things that change) and use 205 
 (coming from the outside of something) (numbers that change/things that change). Both linear and non-linear ways of doing things are used in guessing the endogenous equations. The guess procedure used is ordinary least 
 squares (OLS). The OLS guess way of doing things is 
 preferred over (happening together) guess ways of doing things 
 because, with a large number of (coming from the outside of something) (numbers that change/things that change) 
 and a limited number of (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements), (happening together) 
 guess ways of doing things present/ask/stand in a showy and fake way a degrees of freedom 
 problem. The principal part-related way of doing things is often used to avoid the degrees of freedom 
 problem. Since the number of (coming from the outside of something) (numbers that change/things that change) is 
 too large in the model, the principal part-related 
 way of doing things was not used to guess the model. 
 In the interest of shortness (with words), the complete scientific 
 model could not be included in the text. In Table 1 
 we report the guessed supply and demand elasticities for different countries. In Table 2 we report price 
 transmission elasticities. These ability to stretch guesses 
 
 represent behavioral relationships in the model, which 
 are compared with those found in the books. The 
 guessed own-price supply ability to stretch for red vegetable  in the 
 United states is 0.215 and cross-price (wheat price) 
 ability to stretch is - 0.077. The own-price red vegetable  supply 
 ability to stretch is just like the guesses of Lopez 
 (1989) at 0.246 and Vroomen (1984) at 0.280. 
 Sudaryanto's guess (Sudaryanto, 1987) for an earlier period is 0.70. The guessed own-price ability to stretch

 for cane in the United States is 0.054; cross-price 
 (cotton price) ability to stretch is - 0.05; and input price 
 ability to stretch is -0.046. The own-price cane ability to stretch is 
 very inelastic because of the ratooning practices for 
 sugarcane, which limit the land (change to make better/related to changing something) to 
 price changes. This inelastic guess is similar 
 to the ability to stretch reported by Lopez at 0.1 03, Vroomen 
 at 0.135, Leong ( 1985) at 0.16, and Sudaryanto at 
 0.17. Wong et al. (1989) (WSB) guessed an group US sugar supply ability to stretch of 0.221. The guessed own-price consumption ability to stretch is -0.042 
 and income ability to stretch is 0.254. The own-price ability to stretch guess is almost the same as the ones reported by 
 WSB at -0.048, Vroomen at -0.114, and Lopez at 
 - 0.141. The income ability to stretch guess is just like that of WSB at 0.287. 
 Table 2 reports price transmission elasticities for 
 selected countries. The (serving to severely limit or control) trade policies chased after by these countries insulate their domestic prices 
 from world price movements, by that/in that way reducing price 
 transmission elasticities to less than one. For example, the US domestic price support big plan/layout/dishonest plan and the 
 import quota system result in a price transmission 
 ability to stretch of 0.46 only. (in almost the same way), the EU price helping action big plan/layout/dishonest plan and the changeable import levy policies 
 create a price transmission ability to stretch of 0.48 only. 
 
 4. Hits/effects of the Uruguay Round on the world 
 sugar market 
 
 To examine the effects of the UR, a (a measure of what occurs naturally/sports boundary line) 
 picture/situation is run to project the endogenous (numbers that change/things that change) 
 over the period 1993 to 2001 by using the forecast 
 values of the (coming from the outside of something) (numbers that change/things that change). The forecast values of the (coming from the outside of something) (numbers that change/things that change) are taken from 
 different sources: GDP, GDP deflator, exchange rates, 
 valuable thing production, and prices are received/got from 
 the Food and Farming-based Policy Research Institute 
 (F APRI, 1994b). Population forecasts are received/got 
 from the USDA ( 1993 ). Oil extracted from the ground prices and coffee 
 prices come from a World Bank (1992) report. The 
 (a measure of what occurs naturally/sports boundary line) values of the endogenous (numbers that change/things that change) serve as 
 a test result to measure the effects of trade (easing government rules). 
 The GATT member countries will put into use the 
 policy provision schedule by reducing the group 
 measurement of support, tax/import tax equals, and ex- 
 
 89 
 
 port payments and by increasing import access. The 
 UR policy limits/guidelines along with the new income 
 growths under the UR (received/got from the USDA) are 
 incorporated in the world sugar trade model and the 
 UR picture/situation is run for the period 1995 to 2001. The 
 UR (legal rules/food and supplies) will liberalize the world sugar market 
 as sugar producing countries reduce their domestic 
 producer support, sugar importing countries increase 
 their market access, and sugar exporting countries 
 reduce their export payments. 
 Table 3 presents the (a measure of what occurs naturally/sports boundary line) projections and the 
 hits/effects of the UR on the net trade of major sugar 
 exporters and importers and on the world sugar 
 price. Most major sugar exporting countries increase 
 their net exports because of higher world sugar 
 prices resulting from the UR. However, the EU's net 
 sugar exports decline by an average of about 6% 
 (Fig. I) as a result of lower export payments needed/demanded 
 by the export competition provision of the UR. 
 Thailand's net exports decrease by a very small 
 amount (an average of 0.7%) because the strong 
 consumption increases, resulting from the higher income growth under the UR, run faster than the production 
 increases. India gains significantly from the UR because of its developing country status, availability of 
 more inputs, and improved technology, which result 
 in net exports about 9.5% higher than the (a measure of what occurs naturally/sports boundary line) 
 (Fig. 2). Australia and Brazil also post modest increases in net exports. 
 The hits/effects of the UR on major importing countries change/differ. Net imports by some countries decline 
 (a) little because of higher world prices (Canada), 
 increased substitution from HFCS (Japan), and production increases (Soviet Union). Higher income 
 growth, population growth, and reduction in tax/import tax 
 equals increase US net sugar imports by an 
 average of 16.03%. It should be noted that although 
 this percentage increase seems large, the volume of 
 the net import increase is very small compared with 
 the level of consumption in the United States. In 
 Indonesia, China, and Mexico, strong consumption 
 increases run faster than production increases causing the 
 net imports in these countries to rise. 
 The world income growth caused by the UR 
 increases worldwide  sugar consumption, going past production increases, which causes world sugar prices to 
 increase. The average increase in the world price is 
 about 8.83%, which translates into an increase of

 hits/effects of the UR on sugar production, consumption, and exports or imports for selected countries 
 only. Readers interested in the results for other countries refer to Devadoss and Kropf ( 1995). Here, we 
 provide a described/explained explanation of the UR hits/affects on 
 selected countries. 
 4.1. The United States 
 
 The (a measure of what occurs naturally/sports boundary line) projections show a small decline in 
 sugarcane area of about 6000 areas of land and a modest 
 decline in sugarbeet area of about 100 000 areas of land 
 from 1995 to 2001. These declines in area are in 
 response to US farm policies which, over the last few years, 
 have reduced the domestic price supports. As a result 
 of the UR, the cane and red vegetable  areas are lower than the 
 (a measure of what occurs naturally/sports boundary line) areas by an average of about 0.26 and 
 1.24%, (match up each pair of items in order). These decreases are caused by 
 the continued reduction in US domestic price support 
 and the resulting decline in the producer price. The 
 (a) little larger response of sugarbeet area to sugar 
 price changes is because red vegetable  supply is more elastic 
 than sugarcane supply. The reason for this result is 
 that sugarbeet is a (for only a short time) crop with significant 
 
 (possibility of/possible happening of)  year-to-year difference/different version in area planted, 
 whereas sugarcane area is a long-term crop with 
 3-4-year crop cycle due to ratooning practices. As a result, cane area planted shows little year-to-year 
 difference/different version in the short run. As a result of the decreases 
 in cane and red vegetable  area planted, the (a measure of what occurs naturally/sports boundary line) (describes the future) 
 total US sugar production declines from 1995 to 
 2001 of about 170 000 t. The UR causes an added decrease by an average of 1.06% (Fig. 4). 
 The (a measure of what occurs naturally/sports boundary line) projections of the US sugar consumption show a small increase of about 40 000 t 
 from 1995 to 2001 caused by an increase in US 
 population and income. The UR adds/gives to an 
 added/more income increase in the United States, lowers the price for the US person, and increases 
 HFCS prices relative to sugar prices. These developments result in an average increase in US sugar 
 consumption of about 1.82% over the (a measure of what occurs naturally/sports boundary line) consumption. 
 The (lowering in number/getting worse) production and increasing consumption (popular things/general ways things are going) in the (a measure of what occurs naturally/sports boundary line) will cause US sugar 
 imports to rise by about 360 000 t from 1995 to 
 2001. The tax/import tax reductions in the market-access provision of the UR and the developments in US domestic supply and demand during the putting into use

 Fig. 4. US sugar production under (a measure of what occurs naturally/sports boundary line) and Uruguay Round. 
 
 4.2. (related to Europe) Union 
 
 The Common Farming-based Policy's 1992 changes 
 reduce domestic support for sugar producers. This 
 reduction will result in a decrease in total EU sugar 
 production of about 800 000 t in the (a measure of what occurs naturally/sports boundary line) projections from 1995 to 2001. Declines in domestic supports, taxes/import taxes, and export payments as needed/demanded by the 
 UR will lead to an added decrease in total EU 
 sugar production by an average of about 0.53%. The 
 production Quotas A and B, which receive the domestic price supports, will (lower in number/get worse) by an average of 
 about 1% as a result of the UR. Larger declines will 
 happen in the later years than in the earlier years as 
 market signals arising from the UR tend to be 
 stronger toward the end of the putting into use period. The EU production of C sugar, which receives 
 the rising world price, will grow by an average of 
 2.21% during the putting into use period. Some of 
 the area gave out for Quotas A and B are used for C 
 sugar production because sugarbeet production in the 
 EU, even under C sugar, is still more money-making than 
 the production of other choice crops. As a result, 
 the hit/effect of the UR on EU sugar production is not 
 expected to be as said as the hits/effects on other 
 crops. 
 
 The EU sugar consumption will increase (a) little 
 by an average of 0.55% as a result of lower prices 
 and higher income growth from the UR. A projected 
 spoiling in EU population growth, however, will 
 limit the increase in sugar consumption. The decrease in total EU sugar production, the small increase in sugar consumption, and the reduction in 
 export payments as needed/demanded by the UR will cause a 
 decrease in EU sugar exports by an average of 
 1.23%. This reduction in sugar exports will be less 
 than the EU's commitment of reducing paid-for 
 exports by 340 000 t because the increase in (not getting any helping payments) exports from C production is expected to 
 make up for the decline in paid-for exports. 
 These results also back up (with proof) the findings of FAPRI 
 (1994a) and USDA (1994). So, this decline would 
 have been larger if it were not for the increase in the 
 (not getting any helping payments) exports resulting from higher production of C sugar. 
 4.3. Australia 
 
 Australia's sugar production is strongly affected 
 by developments in the world sugar market and the 
 world sugar price because the country is a sugar 
 exporter and sells its exports at the world price. 
 
 S. Devadoss, J. Kropf/ Farming-based Money flow 15 ( 1996) 83-96 
 
 Australian sugar producers are responding to the 
 higher world price from the UR by increasing their 
 production by an average of about 2.1% over (a measure of what occurs naturally/sports boundary line) production. This increase in production is good by relaxing stiff government rules 
 on cane area and by moving (from one place to another) land from other 
 crop production to sugarcane production. Australia's 
 sugar consumption will increase only (a) little (by 
 0.4%) as a result of higher income growth from the 
 UR and population growth. Larger production increases relative to consumption increases will lead to 
 higher sugar exports by an average of about 2.89% 
 over the (levels that naturally happen). 
 4.4. Brazil 
 
 The UR (legal rules/food and supplies) involve that the developments in 
 the world sugar market and the world sugar price 
 will influence the Brazilian sugar market by relaxing 
 the production controls and export limits. Allowing 
 the sugar industry to export at world prices will let 
 the (producing a lot with very little waste) producers (change to make better/change to fit new conditions) their production. As a result, the increase in the world price under the 
 UR will cause Brazilian sugar producers to increase 
 their sugarcane area, which will result in production 
 increases of an average of about 1.5% over (a measure of what occurs naturally/sports boundary line) 
 production. Brazil's sugar consumption will increase 
 by an average of 1.49% as a result of the higher 
 income growth from the UR, higher population 
 growth, and lower domestic prices. These developments will enable Brazil to increase its sugar exports 
 by an average of 2.3% over (a measure of what occurs naturally/sports boundary line) exports. 
 4.5. India 
 
 Sugar production in India will increase by an 
 average of about 1.37% over (a measure of what occurs naturally/sports boundary line) production. 
 !his increase is due to the increased availability of 
 Improved technology and inputs for production, 
 higher producer income, less government control, 
 and a higher world sugar price resulting from the 
 UR. Population and income increases will cause 
 sugar consumption to rise by an average of about 
 0.81% over the (a measure of what occurs naturally/sports boundary line) projections. These developments will enable India to increase its sugar exports 
 by an average of 5.34% over (a measure of what occurs naturally/sports boundary line) exports.

 5. End/end result 
 
 The (easing government rules) of domestic and trade sugar 
 policies as needed/demanded by the UR will have an hit/effect 
 on sugar supply and demand in different countries. 
 The demand side will be affected by worldwide  income 
 growth, causing an increase in sugar consumption 
 that is more significant in developing countries than 
 in developed countries. People in countries with 
 strong domestic and trade policy helping actions will 
 also enjoy lower domestic person prices, which 
 will increase the (wanting to beat others in contests) of sugar with 
 HFCS. 
 The hit/effect of the UR on the supply side will be 
 less obvious. Low-cost sugar producing countries 
 will benefit from the (a) little higher world price and 
 will increase their production and exports, as is the 
 case in Australia, Brazil, and India. High-cost sugar 
 producing countries will reduce their production 
 (a) little because of lower producer supports and domestic prices. However, the policy changes needed/demanded 
 by the UR have been changed something (to help someone)/took care of someone by most countries through policy changes, which have been already put into use during the past 10 years or so. 
 Fo&#126; &#126;ese co&#126;&#126;tries, the UR mostly serves to (put into law) 
 extstmg poltctes. Therefore, the hit/effect on sugar 
 production in these countries is rather small. This 
 case exists in the United States, where sugar production will decrease by only an average of 1%. In the 
 EU, paid-for sugar production will decrease while 
 (not getting any helping payments) production will increase, resulting in a 
 small decline of sugar exports. 
 As a result of the UR, the consumption increases 
 will go beyond the production increases, causing the 
 world price to rise only (a) little. In general, the 
 (easing government rules) of the sugar market caused by the UR 
 will add/give to a more stable world sugar price 
 and a (producing more with less waste) portion of money-based useful things/valuable supplies in sugar production in different countries.
