 Abstract 
 This paper (asks lots of questions about/tries to find the truth about) fresh meat consumption in Belgium during 1995-1998 through the (detailed description of exactly what is required) of a three-equation 
 almost ideal demand system (AIDS) incorporating a media index of TV coverage and advertising expenses as explanatory 
 (numbers that change/things that change). Guessed limits/guidelines and ability to stretch coefficients are reasonable and agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with demand explanation. Own-price elasticities are (compared to other things) low, pointing to/showing a low fresh meat demand sensitivity to price changes over this period which was ruled 
 by (TV, the Internet, etc.) reports about the possible health risks connected with meat consumption. The extent of/the range of the paper extends 
 beyond the guess of ability to stretch coefficients and includes the (detailed description of exactly what is required) of a media index and tests that provide 
 ideas of the hit/effect of negative press relative to advertising efforts. Specifically, the hit/effect of television (being talked about a lot on TV, online, etc.) is shown 
 to have been especially negative on beef/veal expenses in favour of pork/mixture. This finding conoborates expectations 
 since (TV, the Internet, etc.) issues mainly related to BSE (mad cow disease) and (chemical produced by the body) residues during the (examined closely) period. 
 With (compared to other things) little effort being tried and with its cunent plan, fresh meat advertising is found to have only a minor 
 hit/effect compared with negative press.Â© 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

 1. Introduction 
 
 During the last few years, fresh meat consumption heavily (lowered in number/got worse/gotten worse) in Belgium as it did in most (related to Europe) 
 countries. A lot of scientific research 
 has (not very long ago) been presented with respect to the hit/effect 
 of meat safety scares on people, producers, industry and government policies (McDonald and Roberts, 
 1998; Latouche et al., 1998; Henson and Northen,

 2000; Lloyd et al., 2000; Verbeke et al., 2000). Major 
 meat-health issues in the EU and Belgium included 
 BSE, growth (chemical produced by the body) (very mean, unfair treatment), (serving to stop something bad before it happens) germ-killer 
 residues, germs, classical swine fever, and the 
 (poisonous chemical) problem in Belgium. Each of these problems created a lot of negative (TV, the Internet, etc.) 
 coverage relating fresh meat consumption to potential 
 human health risks. 
 This paper specifies an almost ideal demand system 
 (AIDS) for fresh meat in Belgium to focus on health 
 risk and media coverage hits/effects on personal behaviour. Particular focus is directed to the hit/effect 
 of communication through (TV, the Internet, etc.) (being talked about a lot on TV, online, etc.) and 
 fresh meat advertising on consumption decisions. The

 potential bad effect of media coverage of health 
 issues on fresh meat consumption decisions has been 
 talked to/looked at by Beers and Unnevehr (1988), Carson 
 and Hassel (1994), Rabenstein and Thurman (1996), 
 Kinnucan et al. (1997) and Verbeke et al. (1999). 
 Findings almost (in total agreement) point towards falling 
 meat intake in response to negative press coverage. A 
 related topic with clear policy relevance involves the 
 (possible power or ability within/possibility of)  communication through plain and common thing/not a brand-name drug or brand 
 advertising, specifically in this time  ruled by negative (being talked about a lot on TV, online, etc.) from (TV, the Internet, etc.). Such advertising 
 efforts for fresh meat have been shown to be effective 
 under particular facts or conditions (that surround someone) (Jensen and Schroeter, 
 1992; Forker and Ward, 1993; Ward and Lambert, 
 1993; Piggott et al., 1996; Ward, 1999). However, it 
 has also been reported that a almost the same  amount of bad/unhelpful news weighs far more heavily in person 
 decision-making than good/willing news (Mizerski, 
 1982; Smith et al., 1988; Chang and Kinnucan, 1991; 
 Kinnucan and Myrland, 2000). 
 This analysis is based on an scientific Bayesian 
 approach with the (detailed description of exactly what is required) of an AIDS for fresh 
 meat consumption in Belgium. Since its introduction 
 by Deaton and Muellbauer (1980), the AIDS model 
 has been used in some scientific studies on 
 food consumption in general and meat consumption 
 especially. In our case, monthly time series data are 
 used for the guess of model limits/guidelines and fresh 
 meat ability to stretch coefficients. 
 The extent of/the range of this paper clearly extends beyond 
 presenting ability to stretch coefficients as is done in many 
 applications of the AIDS model. A first extension 
 includes the (detailed description of exactly what is required) of a media index based on 
 TV news reports as a measure of personal knowledge 
 of meat-health issues. Second, the guessed limits/guidelines are used to test out the hit/effect of negative 
 press and advertising on meat demand, expense 
 shares and overall meat expenses. Specifically, 
 the (possible power or ability within/possibility of)  commercial advertising to fight against 
 negative press or (being talked about a lot on TV, online, etc.) is explored. The following 
 section introduces the AIDS (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) for the analysis. Next, data sources and descriptive statistics are 
 presented. Major attention is paid to the (detailed description of exactly what is required) 
 of the negative press (number or thing that changes) or media index. The 
 presentation of the scientific results and ability to stretch coefficients is followed by tests and discussion. 
 Finally, ends/end results and recommendations are set 
 forward. 
 
 2. The almost ideal demand system (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) 
 The AIDS model is created from a personal 
 cost minimisation problem as expressed by a cost or 
 expense function (Deaton and Muellbauer, 1980; 
 Green, 1985) that defines the minimum expense 
 necessary to reach a specific utility level at a given 
 set of prices. By logarithmic (using different things) of the 
 expense function with respect to prices, demand 
 functions are received/got in budget share form. The 
 resulting original AIDS demand functions in budget 
 share form are given by 
 m 
 
 wu = ai 
 
 + LYiJ log PJt + f3i (log Yt 
 
 -log Pr) 
 
 (1) 
 
 }=1 
 
 The left-hand side ofEq. (1) points to/shows the budget share 
 of the ith valuable thing in period t, or wu = puqu/Yt 
 with pit as its price, qit as its amount andy1 as total expense. The right-hand side of the equation includes 
 the limits/guidelines a, f3 andy, p Jt as the price of valuable thing j in period t, and the price index Pt that is defined as 
 m 
 
 log Pt = ao 
 
 + Lak log Pkt 
 
 1 
 
 k=! 
 m m 
 
 +2 LLYkJ log Pkt log Pit 
 
 (2) 
 
 k=1}=1 
 
 Each YiJ represents the change in the ith valuable thing's 
 budget share with respect to a change in the jth price 
 with real expenses held constant. The f3i coefficients represent the change in the ith valuable thing's 
 budget share with respect to a change in real expenses with prices held constant. To be agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with 
 money-based demand explanation, the adding up restriction, 
 evenness and matching properties are (forced (on people)/caused an inconvenient situation) in 
 Eq. (1). Then, Eq. (1) represents a system of demand 
 functions which add up to total expense (i.e. for 
 each (instance of watching, noticing, or making a statement) the sum of the budget shares over 
 all equations always equals one). The evenness 
 of degree zero in all prices and total expense 
 hints that changing all prices and total (in name only/very small amount) 
 expense in proportion will not affect the physical 
 amounts of valuable things demanded or the real buying-related power of the household. Because of this, in (not being there; not being present) of 
 changes in relative prices or real total expense, the 
 budget shares will be constant. Both Marshallian or

 un-paid-for and Dummiesian or income-paid/made up for 
 measures of elasticities can be figured out/calculated following 
 Blanciforti and Green (1983). 
 As pointed to/showed by Chang and Kinnucan (1991), 
 classical static demand explanation assumes perfect information and constant tastes and preferences at the personal level. However, people often possess 
 less-than-perfect information and, more than that, tastes 
 and preferences may change as new or better information is received. When the idea (you think is true) of constant 
 person preferences is relaxed, personal demand 
 models can be extended to includes elements of 
 energetic personal behaviour by allowing some limits/guidelines that describe these preferences to change/differ 
 with (coming from the outside of something) (numbers that change/things that change) (Chang and Green, 1992; 
 Rickertsen et al., 1995; Briz et al., 1998; Rickertsen, 
 1998). One way to include the effects of information 
 is to assume that the price coefficients of the expense function depend upon information frequency 
 levels and advertising expense levels. Including explanatory communication (numbers that change/things that change) is 
 here (understood/made real/achieved) through changing the original AIDS 
 Eq. (1) and price index (2) into

 In Eq. (3), BVADV 1 and PKADV 1 represent actual TV 
 advertising expenses, (match up each pair of items in order), for beef/veal 
 and pork/mixture in period t. The changeable NPR 1 represents the Internet  index. This is a measure of television coverage or negative press related to fresh meat 
 issues. The exact (detailed description of exactly what is required) of this media index is 
 presented in the next section. 
 In the ordinary AIDS model, the (stopping and interfering with things) 
 are constants, restricted to sum to one across the 
 equations. The ordinary adding up restriction 
 is preserved in the extended model by (impressive/forcing (on people)/causing an inconvenient situation)

 parametric restrictions suggested by demand explanation

 (evenness and matching) are unaffected by the 
 change of the (stopping and interfering with things). 
 
 3. Data sources, descriptives and (detailed descriptions of exactly what is required) 
 3.1. Descriptive statistics of the raw data 
 Based on an in-depth survey of the econometric 
 measurement books, Clarke (1976) decided that 
 guess using monthly, (every two months) or quarterly data 
 is most likely free of data period of time (or space) bias. Econometric 
 books points to/shows that the hit/effect of communication 
 on demand is generally a matter of months rather than 
 of quarters or years. Therefore, monthly (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) 
 were used with the data extending from January 1995 
 to December 1998, giving a total of 48 data points for 
 each (number or thing that changes). Amount and price data started from 
 the GfK personal household panel (GfK, 1999) and 
 related to at-home consumption. The great value of 
 panel data as the basic mode of data collection for 
 the measurement of communication effects on demand 
 has been stressed by Simon and Arndt (1980). 
 Using the panel data (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) a three-equation 
 demand system was specified and guessed with the 
 three product groups defined as beef and veal, pork and 
 meat mixtures, and (related to chickens, hens, turkeys, etc.). The reasons for the groupings follows from previous research on Belgian 
 meat people (Peeters et al., 1997; Verbeke, 1999; 
 Verbeke and Viaene, 1999). First, group of beef 
 and veal in the big picture  of this research is reasonable 
 since both beef and veal start from the same animal species and have been facing almost the same  arguments 
 and (being talked about a lot on TV, online, etc.) with respect to potential human health 
 risks. Also, both beef and veal are priced in 
 the upper price range and are because of this thought about/believed as 
 the more expensive fresh meats (Verbeke and Viaene, 
 1999). Second, the group of pork and meat mixture is (done for good reason) by the fact that about 85% of the raw 
 meat used in mixtures is pork. Also, both meat 
 types are positioned as the more convenient and easy 
 to prepare fresh meats. The resulting three-equation 
 demand system, including beef/veal, pork/mixture 
 and (related to chickens, hens, turkeys, etc.) covers 92% of fresh meat expenses in 
 Belgium. For simpleness, the expressions "beef/veal" 
 and "pork/mixture" are used interchangeably with 
 "beef' and "pork", (match up each pair of items in order), in the rest of 
 this paper (e.g. in the (testing out) graphs).

 (large/relatively large) vanatwn in the changeable values is 
 seen across the data period (Table 1). Per-person use volumes range from 0.73 to 1.44kg per 
 month for beef/veal, from 1.49 to 2.73 kg per month 
 for pork/mixture and from 0.66 to 1.39 kg per month 
 for (related to chickens, hens, turkeys, etc.). Prices change/differ  from 7.95 to 9.17 (Euro)/kg for 
 beef/veal, from 4.68 to 6.35 (Euro)/kg for pork/mixture 
 and from 4.04 to 5.65 (Euro)/kg for (related to chickens, hens, turkeys, etc.). The resulting 
 expense shares change/differ  between 31.2 and 42.3% for 
 beef/veal, between 39.1 and 50.8% for pork/mixture 
 and between 15.5 and 24.9% for (related to chickens, hens, turkeys, etc.). 
 Since the specific goal of the paper is to account for the hit/effect of communication on meat demand, advertising and (being talked about a lot on TV, online, etc.) (numbers that change/things that change) are included 
 in the demand system as (before that/before now) described. Advertising expenses have most often been used 
 as a measure of advertising activities. In Belgium, 
 plain and common thing/not a brand-name drug meat advertising efforts are usually begun/tried by a promotion board and gave money (to) partly by 
 government (taxpayers) and partly by checkoffs from 
 all people (who were part of a study, etc.) in the meat chain. Plain and common thing/not a brand-name drug advertising 
 efforts outweigh brand advertising, which is mainly 
 begun/tried by stores or clearly stated/particular organisations with 
 fully (having different things working together as one unit) meat chains. Our study depends on actual TV advertising expenses and because of this assumes 
 every (in name only/very small amount) amount of money spent as an identical treatment without (impressive/forcing (on people)/causing an inconvenient situation) an advertising lag

 structure. This is reasonable given the relative short 
 period hidden (under) the analysis. Plain and common thing/not a brand-name drug and brand 
 TV advertising expense for beef/veal is represented 
 BVADV, while TV advertising for pork is expressed 
 as PKADV. During the time period of time (or space) thought about/believed, no 
 expenses were assigned to television advertising 
 for (related to chickens, hens, turkeys, etc.) or other fresh meats. Given the limited 
 time period covered, neither advertising expense 
 data nor meat prices are (lowered/flattened from losing air). 2 
 2 Reviewers raised the issue of facing the patterns of response to advertising shocks by using a distributed lag structure, 
 almost the same  as for the negative press index (see below). In the above 
 model the negative press index was introduced using a pre-planned lag structure and there is clear evidence that press 
 stories had a total effect. In the models explain in this paper (Eq. (3), Table 2) all advertising is included in the form of 
 (happening at the same time) promotion expenses. The same model was 
 guessed with both the beef and the pork advertising following 
 the same weighting procedures used for the negative press stories. However, in this case, the beef or pork coefficients were not 
 (meaningful numbers). The authors recognise that, with longer 
 datasets, a lag structure for beef and pork advertisement may exist 
 and good qualities (serious thought/something to think about/respect). However, with the limits of the current 
 data, lag structures for beef and pork advertising are not obvious. 
 In some studies on US beef promotions, Ward has decided that the carryover effects are not obvious based on different 
 distributed lag models covering a much longer period than used in 
 the present analysis. The interested reader may contact the authors 
 for more details.

 3.2. (detailed description of exactly what is required) of the Internet  index 
 Much previous research on media impact depended on 
 basic input from scientific journal information files such as 
 MEDLINE. The hidden (under) guess is that those 
 scientific medical journals are read by medical personnel, fighters for fairness or the popular media, who 
 in turn move (from one place to another) the information to people (Rickertsen and von Cramon-Taubadel, 2000). Although 
 journal information file indices often perform (well enough/good enough/in a smart way) 
 well, the clear idea (you think is true) of full information flow 
 from science to person is recognised as the major 
 (bad result or effect) to this approach. Therefore, the effect of 
 (TV, the Internet, etc.) (being talked about a lot on TV, online, etc.) (non-commercial communication) about meat is included in our AIDS model as 
 an information index based on the number of TV 
 news reports of meat issues, which are clearly closer 
 to consumer knowledge. Over the time period under 
 (serious thought/something to think about/respect), almost all these news reports 
 dealt with potential negative effects of meat consumption on human health. Opposite to the situation in e.g. 
 the UK, multiple and less sharp peaks in TV coverage 
 of meat-health issues are watched/followed in Belgium. Over 
 the period of 1995-1998,77% of all TV coverage was 
 related to beef, with the lead clearly being taken by 
 messages related to beef (chemical produced by the body) (very mean, unfair treatment) in 1995 and 
 BSE (mad cow disease) from May 1996. Other issues 
 dealt with the event of residues or germs. 
 A few types of indices have (before that/before now) been introduced for use in econometric demand analysis, 
 ranging from dummy vmiables (Tansel, 1993), actual 
 message numbers (Smith et al., 1988) or total 
 message numbers (Brown and Schrader, 1990; Chang 
 and Kinnucan, 1991; Van Ravenswaay and Hoehn, 
 1991), sometimes with (telling the difference between) negative and positive messages and/or including some 
 message or time weighting factor. 
 In our study, an index based on the number of 
 'negative' minus 'positive' TV reports is proposed as 
 a substitute for personal knowledge of meat issues. This 
 approach is fairly almost the same as  the one used by Burton and Young (1996) which, however, was based on 
 newspaper articles and did not tell the difference between 
 negative and positive reports. The reasons for subtracting positive from negative reports, leading to a 
 number of reports N 1 in month t, is that both message types are assumed to have an opposite hit/effect on 
 person decision-making. While this approach was 
 
 363 
 
 based on possible arguments, practically it is very 
 almost the same as  just using the negative press stories as the 
 relationship between negative stories only and the difference (as used here) is 0.98. There were 190 reports 
 on beef and only 12% were positive. Positive reports 
 were around 6% of the total reports on pork. No TV 
 coverage of (related to chickens, hens, turkeys, etc.) issues happened during the data period of time (or space). Because of this, in either case it was silly/not doable to try 
 to disaggregate or weight and separate out the positive 
 from negative effects this way leading to the reasons for 
 using the difference between the number of negative 
 and positive stories. 3 
 The effect of (TV, the Internet, etc.) coverage is expected to 
 be total extending back a few months. In order to take by force/take control of this, a five-period distributed lag in TV 
 coverage is specified, this way extending the total response 
 period of time (or space) to a period of 6 months for negative press. 
 This lag is agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with recommendations by Clarke 
 (1976) and with the approaches followed by Brown 
 and Schrader (1990), Ward and Lambert (1993) and 
 Kinnucan et al. (1997), as well with widely recognised findings from social (the study of thinking and behavior) and personal 
 behaviour research. So, the fell behind index reflects 
 the assumed delayed hit/effect of messages as information is added to the stock of knowledge or beliefs in 
 people' minds. 
 Given the limited number of (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements), and 
 knowing that each lag reduces the degrees of freedom, an different approach was figured-out for creating 
 the total amount of press (number or thing that changes) NPR1 - In the extreme, 
 the total amount of effect could be 
 NPRt = Nt 
 
 + Nr-1 + Nr-2 + Nt-3 + Nt-4 + Nt-5 
 
 where each period is given the same weight. Or, the total amount of effects could be weighted as 
 
 + m2N1-2 
 +m3Nr-3 + m4Nr-4 + m5Nt-5 
 
 NPRr =moNt+ m1Nr-1 
 
 where the fell behind (TV, the Internet, etc.) coverage values are 
 weighted by coefficients mi. A useful definition of the 
 3 What's more, it is generally easier to classify negative stories 
 than positive ones. Also, most of the positive messages were 
 broadcast with pictures, for example, of a 'mad' cow, 
 a murderhouse or a below the skin syringe (beef (chemical produced by the body)), this way 
 visually drawing the consumer's attention back to the first problems.

 weights is 
 
 where j represents the lag, and r is decided when 
 guessing the AIDS model using a maximum chance search over T values. If r = 0 the (rotted, inferior, or ruined state) is linear 
 and, for example, if r = 2 some fell behind effects go beyond the current media coverage effect. Also, define 
 Mm as the maximum weight among the m 1. With this 
 (detailed description of exactly what is required), the negative press (number or thing that changes) finally enters 
 the model using NPRt = .L N(t-j) (m i j Mm), with 
 T &amp;gt; 0.5. Here, T = 2 is chosen but the results were 
 not very sensitive to the value of r beyond 0.5, where 
 N(t-2) and N(t-3) receive most weight. 
 
 4. Scientific results 
 The AIDS equations were used to guess the limits/guidelines of the demand system for a group of three 
 fresh meat types in Belgium, this way assuming weak separability from other food and non-food valuable things. 
 Hence, choices and preferences within the meat basket are assumed to be independent of price changes 
 for other products (that are bought and sold). Evenness and matching restrictions were forced on people obeying the possible 
 properties of demand systems. Since the adding up 
 condition holds by restrictions, one equation was 
 dropped from the model in order to avoid amazingness. 
 The system is invariant to which equation is deleted 
 and the limits/guidelines of the dropped equation ((related to chickens, hens, turkeys, etc.)) 
 are taken from the adding up conditions. 
 The demand model is tested for negativity, which 
 hints that the matrix of Hessian price effects must 
 be negative semidefinite (Molina, 1994). A Lagrange 
 Multiplier test is applied to detect heteroscedasticity of 
 the disturbance term (Breusch and Pagan, 1979). The 
 LM heteroscedasticity statistic is 0.02 for the beef/veal 
 equation and 1.03 for the pork/mixture equation. Both 
 are unimportant, which means that there is no ground 
 for rejecting the null guess of homoscedasticity. 
 R 2 equals 0.42 for the beef/veal equation and 0.30 for 
 the pork/mixture equation. The econometric limit/guideline 
 guesses, connected standard errors and t-values are 
 presented in Table 2. 
 Limits/guidelines relating to beef/veal and (related to chickens, hens, turkeys, etc.) price 
 effects are (meaningful numbers) at the 5% level 
 
 or better. 4 None of the price effects relating to 
 pork/mixture are (meaningful numbers). With respect 
 to expense effects, the beef/veal and pork/mixture 
 limits/guidelines are highly significant. Expense, Marshallian and Dummiesian elasticities figured out/calculated at the 
 means from the coefficient guesses are presented in 
 Table 3. Expense ability to stretch coefficients are positive as expected for (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) products (that are bought and sold)  and equal 1.13 for 
 beef/veal, 0.88 for pork/mixture and 1.05 for (related to chickens, hens, turkeys, etc.). 
 These high levels point to/show that fresh meat is still quite 
 sensitive to expense with beef/veal and (related to chickens, hens, turkeys, etc.) 
 being a little more sensitive than fresh pork/mixture. 
 The finding that the beef/veal expense ability to stretch 
 clearly goes beyond one backs up (with proof) expectations in that 
 beef/veal is seen as  more expensive meat and 
 the typical meat for festive and special occasions in 
 Belgium (Verbeke and Viaene, 1999). 
 Price ability to stretch guesses are (may or may not happen, depending on something) on (in name only/very small amount) expense on meat being constant. Own-price 
 ability to stretch coefficients are all negative, pointing to/showing the 
 expected inverse relationship between price and amount demanded. As expected for (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) products (that are bought and sold), the 
 Dummiesian own-price elasticities are smaller in total 
 terms than Marshallian elasticities. The differences 
 between un-paid-for and paid/made up for price elasticities result from (compared to other things) high meat expense 
 elasticities. In terms of high levels, all own-price 
 elasticities are less than or equal to one in (value of a number, ignoring its sign), pointing to/showing inelastic demand relationships. 
 The own-price paid/made up for elasticities for beef/veal, 
 pork/mixture and (related to chickens, hens, turkeys, etc.) equal -0.09, -0.61 and 
 -0.15, (match up each pair of items in order). Because of this, beef/veal is the least price 
 sensitive fresh meat while pork/mixture is the most 
 price sensitive, which is assumed to result from the 
 fact that this meat type is constantly affected by retail 
 price promotions. 
 The Dummiesian values provide the most correct picture of cross-price substitution since they provide a 
 measure of substitution effects net of income effects. 
 Most Dummiesian cross-price ability to stretch coefficients are 
 positive, suggesting that net substitutability among fresh 
 meats wins when the income effect is removed. 
 The negative cross-price elasticities for beef/veal and 
 4 Ability to stretch coefficients are received/made from following Blanciforti and 
 Green (1983) and Green (1985). The price slope coefficients can 
 either be positive (as in the current analysis), or negative, and still 
 provide ability to stretch coefficients in line with classical demand explanation.

 (related to chickens, hens, turkeys, etc.) are a important/famous exception. This finding points 
 towards (when two things work together equally well) and can be explained by the 
 fact that both meat types are seen as  the leaner 
 other choice to pork/mixture and are often bought 
 both/together for cooking on a grill. 
 Most limits/guidelines relating to advertising expenses and negative press coverage are found to be 
 significant. A important/famous exception is A11 representing a 
 (only a little bit) unimportant own advertising effect for 
 beef/veal using a one-tail test. Anyway, the 
 coefficient is positive as could be expected. Also, 
 beef/veal advertising has a significant negative effect 
 on pork/mixture consumption and a (only a little bit) significant but positive effect on (related to chickens, hens, turkeys, etc.) consumption. 
 Pork advertising has a significant positive effect on 
 pork/mixture consumption, mainly at the expense of 
 beef/veal consumption. The TV coverage effect is 
 significantly negative for beef/veal and positive for 
 pork/mixture consumption. This mostly backs up (with proof) 
 expectations given the nature of the TV coverage, 
 with mainly negative associations having to do with (chemicals produced by the body) and BSE as beef issues. The hit/effect of the 
 advertising and TV coverage will be further explored 
 and discussed in the tests' sections below. 
 
 5. Testing out the Internet  hit/effect: negative press 
 against/compared to/or advertising 
 As pointed to/showed earlier, TV advertising or promotion 
 has the expected positive effects on beef or pork demand, while the negative press index has opposite hits/effects on the demand for beef (negative) and pork (positive). While some policy issues can be talked to/looked at 
 using (testing out) ways of doing things, we will focus on two of 
 the more important questions: how much change in 
 fresh meat demand can be expected from TV promotion, and what are the relative hits/effects of the negative 
 press compared with the TV promotions? In each of 
 the following tests, the hits/effects are measured 
 by (changing to make better/changing to fit new conditions) one or more (numbers that change/things that change) relative to the mean 
 values of all other (numbers that change/things that change) in the models. The changes/recalculations of the (examined closely) (numbers that change/things that change) range from 50 to 
 150% of their mean level using small steps forward/upward of 10%. 
 In Fig. 1, beef/veal prices on the bottom left axis 
 range from 50 to 150% of the mean price. Demand 
 declines from 1.4 to near 0.8 kg per person per month, 
 this way clearly illustrating the important role of pricing 
 
 in the demand for beef/veal. Responses were also tested out for pork/mixture and (related to chickens, hens, turkeys, etc.) but are not presented here. For comparison, beef/veal advertising also 
 ranges from 50 to 150% of its mean level on the bottom right axis. While the advertising has the expected 
 positive effect, its hit/effect on beef/veal demand is very small compared with price effects. 
 Given a beef price fixed at the mean level in Fig. 1, 
 what are the relative hits/effects of beef and pork promotions? In Fig. 2a and b, changes in both beef and pork 
 promotions are (like the real thing) while holding prices and all 
 other factors constant at their mean values. In contrast 
 to Fig. 1, the (like the real thing) effects are now shown in terms 
 of (your share of sales out of all sales)s so that the different tests can 
 be easily compared. Beef advertising has the expected 
 good effect on beef/veal shares while pork advertising reduces beef/veal's share of the market as seen 
 in Fig. 2a. Yet what is more important is the (compared to other things) 
 small change in the beef/veal share over the (like the real thing) 
 values, from about 0.357 to 0.365 or (a) little under 
 1%. Pork/mixture's share of the market is (like the real thing) 
 in Fig. 2b and the ends/end results are quite almost the same  with 
 pork advertising positively and beef/veal advertising 
 negatively affecting the pork/mixture (your share of sales out of all sales). 
 Combined, Fig. 2a and b show that beef and pork promotions have (compared to other things) small hits/effects on the demand 
 for both meats based on the guesses for the data period of the analysis. 
 From the previous tests, the promotion ability to stretch can be calculated. Using Fig. 1, an guessed 
 advertising ability to stretch shows that for every 10% increase in advertising, the amount demanded increases 
 by 0.05-0.13%, depending on the promotion level and 
 at the mean negative press index level. This ability to stretch is what would be expected; most plain and common thing/not a brand-name drug promotion elasticities are quite small and these results are 
 generally agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with other studies. It is equally 
 important to note that advertising ability to stretch says nothing about the rate-of-return. Small share changes can 
 translate in large relative gains when calculating the 
 rates-of-return to a particular promotion effort (see 
 Ward (1998) for an example of the rate-of-return in the 
 US beef case). Because of this, while the ability to stretch is of interest, it generally has less meaning to decision-makers 
 responsible for plain and common thing/not a brand-name drug promotion programs. 
 The AIDS guesses in Table 2 show the significant 
 hit/effect of TV press reports and the especially bad effect on beef/veal demand. Given the guessed

 responses, is it reasonable to expect that beef/veal advertising could offset the bad effect of TV stories? This issue is (examined closely) in two phases. 
 First, Fig. 3 shows the guessed hit/effect of advertising and negative press on beef (your share of sales out of all sales)s. In this 
 particular example, prices, incomes and other demand 
 drivers are held fixed at their mean values. TV coverage of meat-health issues affects beef/veal's 
 (your share of sales out of all sales) as tested out on the bottom right axis in 
 Fig. 3. Beef/veal shares decline from 0.37 to near 0.35 
 as the number of negative stories increases. While the 
 good effect of beef/veal advertising could counter 
 some of the negative press, it is clear from the different 
 slopes of the border lines in the graph that beef/veal 
 promotions can hardly be expected to fully offset the 
 effect of negative press. It is not clearly connected with or related to show the 
 same graph for pork/mixture since the pork industry 
 is the receiver of money of the negative press stories. 
 Second, tests have been (sang, danced, acted, etc., in front of people) to test the amount of beef TV advertising expenses 
 needed to offset negative press, (in other words) to maintain the 
 
 initial beef/veal (your share of sales out of all sales). The results are displayed in Fig. 4, with the flat/left-and-right axis pointing to/showing 
 the Internet  index. TV advertising expenses are assumed to begin either from zero or from their mean 
 level of 1650 (Euro) per month. Generally, for each unit 
 increase of the Internet  index, beef TV advertising expenses must go up by about 500 (Euro) per month to 
 maintain the beef share at its original level. At the 
 mean media index level of 15.1, beef TV advertising 
 expense would need to be increased to about 8000 
 (Euro) per month or about five times its mean value over 
 the data period. Finally, if negative TV stories continue to be broadcast and the Internet  index increases to 
 its (like the real thing) maximum of 28.7, a 10-fold increase in 
 the beef TV advertising expenses will be needed 
 to offset the negative press effect. 
 Given the promotion efforts and the resulting demand responses watched/followed in recent history, the promotion gains are small relative to the hit/effect of negative 
 press. If the effectiveness of TV promotions could be 
 improved, the expense levels needed to offset the

 negative press would be somewhat less. Anyway, 
 it is seen/obvious for the beef/veal industry that the conditions leading to the negative press must be changed 
 and that the content and (machine/method/way) of beef/veal advertising needs to be improved if this industry expects 
 to reverse the current problems with media coverage 
 and its hit/effect on beef demand. 
 
 6. Expenses and the negative media 
 The AIDS model in budget share form based on 
 meat expenses enables one to (ask lots of questions about/try to find the truth about) what really drives changes in fresh meat demand: negative 
 TV coverage or the level of expenses on all meats? 
 Changes in the total expenses on meats (i.e. the y 1 
 in the AIDS model from Eqs. (1) and (3)) along with 
 changes in the amount of negative TV coverage are 
 (like the real thing) in Fig. Sa and b. 
 What is most seen/obvious in both graphs is that changes 
 in total expense on meats create much 
 greater moves/changes in (your share of sales out of all sales)s than result from negative press. In Fig. Sa, beef/veal's share of the meat 
 market, even with the most negative levels of press, 
 increases from 32 to over 37% as total expenses 
 range from 50 to 150% of the current level. As the 
 number of negative press stories declines the share increases to over 38%.

 Clearly, the beef/veal industry would benefit from 
 an overall growth in personal spending on all meats 
 (without any concern about/having nothing to do with) negative TV coverage. Therefore, the 
 growth in total expenses could far outweigh the 
 negative press hits/effects. In contrast, pork/mixture loses 
 (your share of sales out of all sales) as total meat expenses increase, 
 with the shares (lowering in number/getting worse) from over 48 to near 42% 
 (Fig. Sb). Pork industry gains from negative TV coverage are easily seen in the form of the positive slope 
 on the bottom left axis in Fig. Sb. 
 
 7. Testing out total expense changes 
 In all of the previous figures, responses were tested out using mean values as the base. An different 
 approach to showing the hits/effects is to calculate the 
 change in expenses over the actual data period 
 (January 1995 to December 1998) assuming that a particular condition had not happened. For example, the 
 model allows one to (describe the future) expense on each meat 
 type under actual market conditions and then compare 
 this to a situation in which there were no negative 
 press stories. The total amount of expense changes 
 would be attributed to the negative press in this example. In Fig. 6 such tests have been completed 
 for each of the (examined closely) media efforts. Changes in 
 expense are shown for beef/veal, pork/mixture and

 (related to chickens, hens, turkeys, etc.) under the condition that the Internet  efforts were 
 zero compared to the actual ones. 
 The first three bars in Fig. 6 measure the total amount of hit/effect of the TV coverage of meat-health issues. 
 Negative press resulted in an overall lower expense of about 195 million (Euro) for beef/veal and 125 
 million (Euro) for (related to chickens, hens, turkeys, etc.), both to the benefit of pork 
 expenses (the positive middle bar). The picture 
 for negative press and advertising together is fairly 
 almost the same, which confirms the finding that advertising 
 effects are modest compared with the hit/effect of negative press. The beef/veal expense gain attributed 
 to beef/veal advertising amounts to some 40 million 
 (Euro), which is in (value of a number, ignoring its sign) almost five times lower 
 that the hit/effect of negative press. Pork/mixture is the 
 major loser as a result of beef/veal advertising and 
 beef is the major loser as a result of pork advertising. It is important that the combined hit/effect of 
 beef and pork advertising resulted in small losses of 
 expenses for both meats to the benefit of (related to chickens, hens, turkeys, etc.). 
 What is most important is the ranking of these hits/effects as shown from the left to the right in Fig. 6, with 
 the control of negative press on beef and (related to chickens, hens, turkeys, etc.) 
 and the clear gains to the pork industry. Plain and common thing/not a brand-name drug and 
 brand advertisement have effects of the expected signs, 
 but are of little result compared with negative 
 press. 
 
 8. Ends/end results 
 This paper has focused on (asking lots of questions about/trying to find the truth about) the hit/effect 
 of negative TV coverage and advertising on meat consumption through the (detailed description of exactly what is required) and guess of 
 a three-equation AIDS model with monthly data covering the period of January 1995 to December 1998. 
 Negative press coverage of meat-health issues entered the model as a five-period fell behind and weighted 
 index based on the number of negative minus positive TV news reports. The limit/guideline guesses and 
 resulting ability to stretch coefficients are reasonable and 
 mostly agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with classical demand explanation. The 
 own-price ability to stretch coefficients of the fresh meats 
 are (compared to other things) low compared with (before that/before now) reported 
 ability to stretch coefficients from other countries. Although 
 the current model does not deal with limit/guideline 
 changes, it appears reasonable to assume that fresh 
 meat demand has become less price sensitive in an 
 
 time  ruled by continuous reports about potential 
 health risks. 
 Tests based on our AIDS guesses provide 
 in-depth scientific ideas of the hit/effect of negative 
 press and advertising. Findings from this time series 
 analysis show the huge hit/effect of negative (being talked about a lot on TV, online, etc.) and mostly back up (with proof) previous research by Verbeke et al. (2000) based on thin sliceal data from 
 a sample of Belgian meat people. The tests 
 based on the model guesses clearly extend beyond 
 the guess of ability to stretch coefficients and along with this 
 respond to a major criticism by Ward (1999, p. 518) on 
 the use of many demand models in scientific research. 
 The findings are most upsetting with respect to television (being talked about a lot on TV, online, etc.), (in other words) TV coverage of the potential bad health effects of meat consumption, and are not 
 very promising with respect to advertising. The last thing just mentioned may be not so surprising. Following Forker and 
 Ward (1993), some advertising expense dividing line 
 may have to be went beyond before any significant results 
 are (saw/heard/became aware of). This certainly holds in times ruled 
 by long/big negative media coverage that mostly outweighs almost the same  amounts of positive coverage aimed at 
 personal kind words. While the own beef advertising effect is found to be (related to numbers) unimportant, the 
 guess that television (being talked about a lot on TV, online, etc.) negatively affects 
 beef/veal demand is (related to numbers) supported and fully 
 explored in the tests. At the mean media index 
 level, beef TV advertising expenses would need to 
 be increased to about five times their mean level in order to maintain beef expense share. Shifts are seen 
 towards using/eating pork/mixture, both as a result of a 
 response to negative beef/veal press and positive own 
 advertising effects. 
 The hit/effect of the negative press and advertising 
 is also illustrated by the calculation of expense 
 gains or losses at the industry level. Again a negative 
 press/advertising ratio of about 5 is found, with the total beef expense gain attributed to own advertising 
 being five times lower in (value of a number, ignoring its sign) than the total loss resulting from negative (being talked about a lot on TV, online, etc.). The results 
 clearly show the big impact of negative press on 
 the beef/veal industry, as well as the small 
 performance of brand and plain and common thing/not a brand-name drug advertising efforts. 
 Increases in total meat expenses could outweigh

 second, is hard to influence directly by the affected 
 parts/areas. Therefore, eliminating the grounds for negative press, and searching for better and more effective 
 ways of communicating come out  as recommendations 
 for the meat industry, and especially for the beef 
 part/area.
