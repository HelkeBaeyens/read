 ABSTRACT 
 Belete, A., Dillon, J.L. and Anderson, F.M., 1991. Development of farming in Ethiopia 
 since the 1975 land reform. Agric. Econ., 6: 159-175. 
 A stated goal of the Ethiopian Government since it came to power in 1975 has been 
 to increase the production of crops for both domestic consumption and export. As a result, some plans and programs have been proposed and put into use to bring 
 about such development in Ethiopian farming. This paper mainly focuses 011 a macro 
 review of the general course of Ethiopian farming-based development since the land reform of 
 1975. The food production in Ethiopia has fell behind the population growth as 
 proven true by the gap between the growth rates of population (3%) and food production 
 (1.8%) over the period from 1970 to 1983. (not very long ago), this situation has, maybe, further 
 broke down/got worse. Seventy-one percent of the total land mass is guessed to be good for 
 farming, but only about 19% is (helped to grow). This suggests an underutilisation of land. 
 More than that, Ethiopia has a (constant/not going away) survival/income production problem in farming. Farming-based research and education which are very important to development have not been given due 
 attention by the policy makers. As a result, the farming-based technologies used by farmers 
 have changed little in this century. More than that, small-scale farmers, although still the most 
 strong  money-based force in the country, have not been given the (rewards or reasons for doing something) necessary to 
 expand production, and now receive less than (good) enough support from the central 
 government. Some 85%, 50%, and 79% of total farming-based credit, fertiliser and improved 
 seeds (match up each pair of items in order) go directly to socialist businesses/projects (state farms and producers' cooperatives) which, up to 1985, have both/together accounted for only 5% of the total (helped to grow) land and 
 4% of the national crop production. The favouring of large-scale and capital-intensive 
 state-owned farming businesses/projects with credit, payments, and money-related (rewards or reasons for doing something), while neglecting 
 smallholders, has added/has given to the spoiling of farming-based production in Ethiopia. 
 Overall, the analysis points to/shows that there has been no significant development of farming 
 in Ethiopia following the 1975 land reform.

 INTRODUCTION 
 
 Ethiopia is mostly an farming-based country. It is believed to possess an 
 huge (possibility of/possible happening of)  farming-based production, a potential which has not 
 yet happened/been made real. Out of the total land area of 1.22 million km 2 , some 71% 
 is guessed to be good for farming. However, only 19% of the land is 
 at some time used for crop production (NRDCjCPSC, 1983; MSFD, 1984). 
 This (based on what's seen or what seems obvious) low rate of use is due in part to common problems 
 of bad disease, sleeping sickness, etc. in the lowland areas. But 40% of the 
 country's total area is classified as highlands (above 1500 m a.s.l.) and 
 about 88% of the national farming population lives in these highland areas. 
 Before 1975, the land-related (process of people making, selling, and buying things) in Ethiopia was mostly (related to a very old land ownership system). 
 During the (related to a very old land ownership system) time  an farming-based extra was (pulled out or taken from something else) by a (compared to other things) 
 small group of (managers of apartment buildings). It is generally believed that the system kept the 
 poor people poor and preserved old simple/from many years ago (producing crops/helping something grow) 
 practices. (state of not being safe/source of mental worry) of individual (length of time at work or in power/right to permanent employment) under the (related to a very old land ownership system) system also 
 reduced We (rewards or reasons for doing something) for (people or businesses who occupy a house, office, etc.) to increase yields through investment in 
 the improvement of land. The overall effect of these (length of time at work or in power/right to permanent employment) arrangements 
 was reflected in the spoiling of farming. This perceived bottleneck 
 was removed by the land reform legal announcement of 4 March 1975 which made 
 all (away from cities) lands public property and in that way basically changed land-related 
 relationships in Ethiopia (PMAC, 1975). Since 1975, through a series of 
 related legal announcements, the government has tried to organize farming 
 into production units of individual farms, each of at most 10 ha, state farms 
 (mainly making up former huge houses, (large farms with crops) and large commercial farms) 
 and producers' cooperatives. 
 Under the land reform, private farm families were .organized into 
 Poor (person) Associations (PAs) each including a (in name only/very small amount) 800 ha and 
 usually made up of 300 to 400 farmers and their families. Members of 
 each PA helped grow the land as people. The total number of PAs, as of 
 1985, was 20 158 with a total membership of some 5.6 million families 
 (MOA, 1985b). In the same year there were 54 state farms operating on 
 250 000 ha of land. There were also 1856 producers' cooperatives, of which 
 only 191 were registered and had legal status. These cooperatives accounted for a total of 132 842 farm families (MOA, 1985a). 
 In spite of these major changes to the structure of farming in the 
 country, production has gone bad. 
 Now, Ethiopia is experiencing a wide food gap. Farming-based production has been increasing every year by about 1.8% while population 
 growth is about 3% (World Bank, 1984). Although recent data are 
 not available, per-caput consumption of cereals and pulses fell steadily 
 from an guessed 415 g per caput per day in 1975/76 to 367 gin 1981/82

 (FAO, 1982). Ethiopia has become a regular importer of some 300 to 400 
 thousand metric tonnes of food grain each year. Imports of food increased 
 from US$11.2 million in 1974 to US$62.3 million in 1982 (NBE, 1982). The 
 total volume of food aid flowing into the country increased from 135 000 
 metric tonnes in 1978 to 243 000 metric tonnes in 1982 (FAO, 1982). The 
 increase in food aid is even more striking if the drought years of 1984 and 
 1985 are taken into account. In each of these years, international food 
 help reached 1.1 million metric tonnes of grain (RRC, 1985). 
 The basic restriction on development in Ethiopia is that farming 
 now produces little money-based extra. Yet, it is the farming-based part/area 
 that can provide investable useful things/valuable supplies for national development. Farming, according to NRDCjCPSC (1982a), should finance its own growth 
 and also finance industrialisation of the country. The problem, therefore, is 
 how to (accomplish or gain with effort) development and growth in farming. An appreciation of 
 the general course of farming-based development in Ethiopia since the 1975 
 land reform may provide some ideas on this matter to decision makers in 
 Ethiopia. 
 ROLE OF AGRICULTURE IN ETHIOPIA'S ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 
 STRATEGY 
 
 Farming can directly add/give to Ethiopia's money-based development 
 in six important ways. These are (NRDCjCPSC, 1983): 
 (1) by providing basic food supplies for the nation; 
 (2) by creating foreign exchange earnings through farming-based exports; 
 (3) by supplying labour needed by the industrial part/area; 
 (4) by providing the necessary capital for industrial development and social 
 investment; 
 (5) by raising the income of the (away from cities) population and in that way being an 
 important source of effective demand; and 
 (6) by providing employment for a significant part of the (away from cities) population. 
 The size and part/areaal origins of Ethiopia's GDP over the period 1970/71, 
 to 1985/86 are shown in Table 1. From these data it can be seen that 
 agriculture's share of GDP, at around 50% (made up of some 80% from 
 crop and some 20% from animals production) did not change significantly 
 over the period. The industrial, domestic trade and other services parts/areas 
 make up about 15%, 15% and 20% of GDP, (match up each pair of items in order). The data also 
 show that farming made an almost equal (thing that's given/work that's done) to the GDP of the 
 country during both the pre- and after- 1975 period. The development of the 
 non-farming-based parts/areas has not reduced (a lot) the (very big/very strong) 
 rule of the (process of people making, selling, and buying things) by the farming-based part/area. The money-based 
 development of Ethiopia will continue to depend mostly on farming 
 for at least 50 years to come.

 Agriculture's (thing that's given/work that's done) is also important/famous in the earnings of foreign 
 exchange needed for modernization of the country. Over the ten-year 
 period 1975/76 to 1984 j85, export earnings mostly started in farm-related. Table 2 shows that agriculture's share in the total value of exports was 
 close to 90% over the period 1975j76 to 1984/85. The value of coffee 
 exports has generally increased. However, the value of exports of pulses 
 and oil seeds has tended to (lower in number/get worse). Exports of animals and their products 
 and other industrial crops have not grown importantly. 
 PERFORMANCE OF THE PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SECTORS OF AGRICULTURE 
 SINCE 1975 
 
 Appropriate production technologies, research, extension and agrometeorological services are important factors affecting farming-based working well in Ethiopia.

 University (AAU, 1980), confirms the view that improved and appropriate 
 technology is not available or used by lots of smallholder 
 farmers in Ethiopia. 
 , The large gap between crop yields on research plots and on farmers' 
 fields points to/shows that the research results are either beyond the small 
 farmers' reach or they are not extended to the farmers in a proper way 
 (Table 3). The complex (the study of (or the location of) mountains, rivers, hills, etc.) of Ethiopia and important local differences in climate, soils, etc., make it hardest to overcome these gaps 
 unless the money/giving money (to) of farming-based research is very much increased. 
 The shortage of agro-weather-related services and information in the 
 country, for example, hints that the problems connected with (related to the Earth's weather) 
 difference/different version in a country like Ethiopia where smallholder farming depends 
 completely on rainfall, are (ignored/didn't notice/looked at). The country also has big 
 (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) restrictions to increased production among which the most 
 important are wearing away due to not enough water and soil conservation 
 programmes, high human and animals population pressures on farming-based land, and repeated and (constant/not going away) drought especially in the northern 
 and northeastern areas. These restrictions limit directly the opportunities 
 of development efforts, especially in the poor (person) farming part/area where 
 individual farmers' efforts can not lessen their effects.

 of the national crop. The PCs accounted for about 1.8% of land in 
 farming-based use and added/gave about 1.2% of the total national crop 
 production. 
 Over the same period, cereals ruled national crop production, 
 accounting for over 80% of the area spread around (Tables 5 and 6). Pulses and 
 oilseeds accounted for all but a minor percentage of the rest of the 
 croppmg. 
 Guesses of the once-a-year compound growth rate of area and of production for the period 1975 j76 to 1985 j86 point to/show that the output of cereals 
 increased by an average of 1.91% per year, whereas the once-a-year growth 
 rate in area spread around was 0.88%, the output of pulses and oilseeds increased by 
 1.67% and 6.74% per year, (match up each pair of items in order), while their growth rate in area 
 was 1.26% and 3.36% per year, (match up each pair of items in order). The compound growth 
 rates in area and production were highest for oilseeds due to (the creation of/the beginning of the existence of) state farms and the (creation and construction/ group of objects) of producers' cooperatives since 
 these two parts/areas have given special focus to the production of exportable crops such as oilseeds. 
 Table 7 shows that, at the national level, yields per hectare of most 
 major crops have been (lowering in number/getting worse). The national level yield data were 
 disaggregated to test the once-a-year change in yields per ha at the part/area 
 level. The results are presented in Table 8. They point to/show that positive

 State farms do not produce these crops. 
 
 Tables 7 and 8 point to/show that the (compared to other things) unimportant growth in cereal and 
 pulse production in Ethiopia over the after-(related to fighting authority or causing huge, important changes) ten years was not 
 only due to no (act of something getting bigger, wider, etc.) of the (helped to grow) area but also to declines in yield, 
 especially in the state-owned and operated farming-based parts/areas. More 
 importantly, the once-a-year growth rates of cereal and pulse production -both 
 guessed to be less than 2% - are less than the current once-a-year population 
 growth rate of 3%. For reasons of national food security and development, 
 it is important  to decide/figure out why total crop production has not significantly 
 increased over the period of the last 11 years when, (probably), the 
 problem of (length of time at work or in power/right to permanent employment) (state of not being safe/source of mental worry) was solved by land reform and improved 
 technologies had been extended to farmers. 
 Some discussion of animals production is necessary to give a more 
 complete picture of Ethiopian farming. Animals play an important role 
 in Ethiopian farming in supplying animal power for (producing crops/helping something grow), especially 
 in highland areas. In the highlands, poor (person) farmers keep animals as a 
 form of insurance against crop failure, as a form of savings for emergency 
 use, for breeding draught animals for cropping, to supply transport services, to supply poop/fertilizer for fuel and as a source of meat and milk (FAO, 
 1982; GOE/ AACM, 1984). The national groups and groups/travels are mainly kept

 in the highlands where disease challenges to animals are less than in the 
 hotter lowland areas. Animals are privately owned and the markets for 
 stock, meat and other animal products are not subject to significant 
 government helping action. Animals have been and still are the single most 
 important capital valuable thing of (away from cities) people. The Ethiopian highlands are 
 stocked at an average of 35 (related to areas near the Equator/hot and humid) Animals Units per km 2 - higher than 
 any other area of similar size in the continent. Ethiopia has the largest 
 animals population in Africa (FAO jLUPRD, 1984). The guessed animals population of Ethiopia in 1982 is shown in Table 9. Its size is 
 impressive, but its working well is low (Table 10). There are a few reasons 
 for this (FAO jLUPRD, 1984). 
 Firstly, the number of animals in Ethiopia is not in balance with the 
 available feed useful things/valuable supplies. Overstocking - connected with resulting land 
 worsening - is (existing all over a large area) in the highland areas. General levels of 
 nutrition of animals are low and hold back both production and reproduction. Secondly, although the highlands are mostly free of trypanosomiasis 
 and other important sicknesses mainly happening in the lowlands, animals in 
 the highlands are affected by many other sicknesses causing deadliness and

 death. Thirdly, the animals marketing system is poorly developed. The 
 main animals production and extra areas are located far from the main 
 local meat-using/eating andjor exporting centres. The transport of animals 
 over these long distances is mostly by traveling. Animals are driven for days 
 without proper feed, water and rest causing significant bodyweight losses 
 before murder. In the usual farming/managing money systems, draught oxen are 
 given priority in feeding over stock which are traded or sold, so the last thing just mentioned 
 are almost never specially fattened before disposal. Anyway, animals sales 
 are the major source of cash income in the mostly survival/income farming 
 areas. Introduced animals breeds have had little hit/effect nationally and 
 they are mainly in the small-scale commercial dairy part/area close/nearest to 
 Addis Ababa (Tegene and Tenassie, 1984). 
 INVESTMENT IN AGRICULTURE 
 
 The central importance of farming to the nation is stressed in the 
 national development plan of Ethiopia (NRDCjCPSC, 1983). The plan has 
 admitted/recognized/responded to the need to increase and (branch out into different things) farming-based output, to 
 (accomplish or gain with effort) independence in food supply, and to raise (away from cities) incomes and living 
 standards. To (accomplish or gain with effort) this, big public investment in farming is of 
 most important importance. Viewed over time, maybe the most famous aspect 
 of public investment in farming is that its after- 1975 share is greater than 
 its pre-1975 share (Table 11). The socialist Government created its first 
 ten-year long-term plan in 1981 for the period 1984 to 1994 (NRDCjCPSC,

 1982a). According to this plan farm-related will get 22.1% of the total 
 national investment. Out of the total farming-based budget, 10.8% is for 
 poor (person) farming, 6.1% for state farms, 22.4% for producers' cooperatives 
 and settlement farms, 38.6% for crop-watering/rinsing with water farming on state farms, 9.8% for 
 export crops, 4.2% for forestry, 7.8% for animals and 0.3% for fisheries. 
 The most striking point, however, is the large total and relative size 
 of investment pictured for the crop-watering/rinsing with water and settlement sub-parts/areas. 
 These two sub-parts/areas together make up/be equal to 61% of the total investment 
 planned for farming and over 13% of total planned investment. Settlement farms are also state-owned farms. Crop-watering/rinsing with water farming is only on 
 state farms. Very differently, poor (person) farming is to receive only 11% of the total 
 investment planned for farm-related going along with/matching up to 2% of the planned 
 total national investment. This highlights the lack of appreciation of the 
 (related to a plan to reach a goal) role of smallholders in the development of Ethiopian farming. 
 What's more, the giving out of this investment between the poor (person) and 
 cooperative poor (person) farming is not clear. It is likely that (even though there is the existence of) their poor 
 performance to date (mid term through the ten-year plan), the focus 
 will continue to be on state farms, producers' cooperatives and settlement 
 farms. This will result in underinvestment in the poor (person) part/area, the part/area 
 which has, (even though there is the existence of) limited state support since 1975, gave/given the only 
 working well gains watched/followed in Ethiopia's farming-based (process of people making, selling, and buying things). 
 Some projects have been done during the last 20 years to 
 supply farm inputs (e.g., (material that makes plants grow better) and improved seed), to provide (for only a short time) 
 credit for the (instance of buying something for money) of inputs and to make farming-based extension 
 services available to smallholders. Anyway, the domestic portion of 
 capital outlays for these 'package' programs was generally not enough and

 most of them were dependent on external money for their operation. 
 Farming, besides providing food and employment to the people and raw 
 materials to businesses, also supplies about 90% of the total exports by 
 value. (even though there is the existence of) this, the portion of foreign exchange for the (instance of buying something for money) of 
 farming-based equipment and imported farm inputs was only between 2.3% 
 and 10.2% of total export go aheads from farming over the period 
 1971/72 to 1980/81 (NRDCjCPSC, 1982b). Also, although the farming-based part/area adds/gives more than 50% of GDP and accounts for 85% of 
 employment, the useful things/valuable supplies gave out to farming-based research are not enough. In 1982/83, for instance, only about 0.4% of the 1981/82 GDP was 
 gave out to farming-based research. 
 INCENTIVES TO PRODUCERS 
 
 Farmers growing crops for sale have responded to the failure of the 
 government to provide them with proper (rewards or reasons for doing something) (prices) by backing away/moving away 
 further into the survival/income mode. Almost all government farm-gate 
 prices (required quota selling prices) for the (people and businesses that are not part of the government) for most crops 
 have fallen behind well behind local free-market prices. Farmers terms of trade 
 broke down/got worse as producer prices remained fixed relative to the prices of 
 major farming-based inputs, especially of (material that makes plants grow better). At current official prices 
 smallholders do not cover their cost of production for some crops. 
 The pattern of distribution of (material that makes plants grow better), improved seed and farming-based 
 credit has also (not having money or education) smallholder farmers. As may be seen from 
 Tables 12, 13 and 14, state farms (which for example in 1980/81 added/gave less than 5% to national crop production and made up/was equal to less than

 5% of the total area helped grow) used 52% of the (material that makes plants grow better), 79% of 
 improved seed and 91% of farming-based credit available nationally. In the 
 same year, the poor (person) part/area which helped grow 95% of the area and 
 added/gave 94% of the national harvest used 43, 16 and 9% of (material that makes plants grow better), 
 improved seed and credit (match up each pair of items in order) which were available. 
 Too much/too many focus on the two state farming-based parts/areas and hence 
 neglect of the poor (person) part/area has resulted in low farm input consumption 
 by this latter part/area. Smallholders' (reward or reason for doing something) for producing more are also 
 dampened by the large scale helping action of the State in food grain 
 marketing. This helping action compounds the (problems, delays, etc.) of marketing in a 
 nation with limited road, transport and storage facilities. 
 CONCLUSIONS 
 
 Ethiopian farming-based development has been very much held back by the 
 application of inappropriate farming-based policies and the low amount of investment in the smallholder part/area which rules the national (process of people making, selling, and buying things). 
 Low working well and poorly structured markets for farming-based inputs and 
 outputs have also added/gave to the poor performance of the farming-based 
 part/area since 1974/75. The often (without hope/very upset) food situation in the country has 
 not improved very much since then. Poor growth in production can be 
 attributed to different factors, the most important of which are: the favouring of large-scale and capital-intensive state-owned farming businesses/projects 
 with rare/not enough  credit, other modern inputs and skilled labour to the relative 
 neglect and generally to the harm of smallholders and the (numbers-based) 
 and (not numbers-based) shortages of research, extension and other support service efforts. 
 The 1975 land reform did secure/make sure of access to land to the country's 5.6 
 million smallholder farm families. However, a successful land reform would 
 have taken better account of the money-based, (related to computers and science) and social factors 
 involved. 
 The socialist farming-based revolution in Ethiopia has not yet resulted in 
 the cooperatives and state farms using more than 5% of the total (helped to grow) 
 land or producing more than 4% of the total farming-based production 
 although, together, they have accounted for more than 60% of publicly 
 gave money (to) farming-based investment, 91% of farming-based credit, 79% of improved seed portion and 52% of (material that makes plants grow better) used in the 1975 j76 to 
 1985 j86 period. 
 Goal conditions must be taken into account when moving from 
 redistribution to collectivization in a country where survival/income production 
 with a low level of technology continues to rule the 
 farming-based part/area. The drive towards collectivization should neither under-

 guess nor ignore the important money-based role that could and should be 
 played by the small-scale farmers who now account for 96% of total 
 farming-based production. Greater attention to the strengthening of smallscale farmers is warranted, in fact very important, in order to increase farming-based production and to (help increase/show in a good way) (away from cities) development in Ethiopia.
