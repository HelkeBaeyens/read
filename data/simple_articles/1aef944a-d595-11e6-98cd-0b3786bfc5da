 Abstract 
 This paper presents case-study results and group data to test the hit/effect of research in African farming. Of 32 case 
 studies, all but eight report once-a-year returns over 20% and many are far higher, with most gains arising in the late 1980s and 
 1990s. Helped/encouraged by policy changes and changing (rewards or reasons for doing something), these inventions of new things have led to (growth over time) in group cereal 
 crop yields since 1985. Africa's late 'green revolution' is based on new varieties (often with early maturing for drought 
 escape), complemented by new management ways of doing things (usually labor-intensive efforts to (protect from harm) soil moisture and build 
 soil life-creating ability). Â© 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

 1. Introduction 
 Total investment in African farming-based research 
 increased during the 1960s and 1970s, but has gone bad or (lowered in number/got worse/gotten worse) since then (Pardey et al., 1997). Low 
 levels of support may be due to the failure of research 
 to create visible gains. This paper shows that past 
 benefits of research in Africa were hidden by other 
 factors, and that recent changes have made the gains 
 from research much clearer. 
 Using group data, we show that the continent's 
 decline in per person production happened between

 1973 and 1985, a period of very fast population growth, frequent (riots, looting, etc.), and heavy taxation 
 of farming, all of which very much/very badly reduced working well. Without research, performance during this period might have been even worse than it was. 
 Using case studies, we show that by the late 1980s, 
 many ways of doing things produced by research were 
 being adopted, and are now producing high levels 
 of social gain. These include new varieties, whose 
 principal feature is often early maturity for drought 
 escape, as well as new management ways of doing things aimed 
 at moisture keeping/holding onto/remembering and soil life-creating ability. This type of 
 technical change is very different from that which 
 produced the green revolution in Asia and Latin 
 America, where greater moisture availability made 
 short height and (material that makes plants grow better) (quality of quickly responding to things) the keys 
 to higher yield.

 performance

 Although the data are limited, Africa-wide conditions can maybe best be described using FAO index 
 numbers for production, exports and imports, as 
 shown in Fig. 1. After a period of (compared to other things) good 
 performance in the 1960s, the FAO index of total 
 farming-based production per person fell regularly 
 from 1971 to 1984, for a total decline of 
 22% (from about 115 to 90). In the same period, 
 the amount/quantity of farming-based exports fell even more 
 sharply, for a total decline of over 40% (from 
 about 120 to near 70). And the amount/quantity of farming-based 
 imports rose also, more than tripling over the period 
 (from around 40 to 130). 
 The beginning of the decline in the 1972-1973 and the 
 beginning of recovery in 1985 can maybe be linked to 
 climate change, especially in the Sahel area where 
 rainfall was below long-term averages during this 
 whole period. But Africa as a whole appears to have 
 had (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) weather (Nicholson et al., 1988; Le 
 Houerou et al., 1993), so sustained farming-based weakness during the long 1971-1984 period, and later recovery must have been due to causes other 
 than climate. 
 Some clues as to the causes of farming-based spoiling are given by focusing on cereal grains. In 
 Fig. 2, we show average cereal grain yields for all

 Sub-Saharan Africa, West Africa, and the Sahel from 
 1960 to 1995, calculated from USDA data. The continent, area and smaller area show somewhat different 
 year-to-year difference/different version, but a almost the same 20-yr 
 period of yield spoiling from 1964 until their lowest 
 point in 1984. Most (in a surprising and interesting way), after 1984, there is a 
 sustained improvement in yields through 1995 in all 
 three areas. 
 Total production, shown in index-number terms on 
 Fig. 3, is a result of both produces and area. Again, 
 USDA data show a break after 1984, which is most 
 dramatic for the Sahel. All three areas had significant 
 increases in total cereal grain production from 1960 to 
 1984, but growth speeded up sharply in the following 
 ten years especially in the Sahel. 
 Figs. 2 and 3 are group averages, around which 
 there is huge (quality of changing over time or at different places) at the level of individual 
 crops and countries. Measurement error certainly

 plays a role, although sustained (popular things/general ways things are going) such as those 
 shown here are unlikely to be due to chance alone. 
 And it is important to note that group growth could 
 happen even if yields for all crops and countries are 
 constant, if production were to move/change towards higheryield crops and countries. 
 A few possible explanations could account for 
 Africa's seen/obvious success in raising group yields 
 over the past ten years. Access to markets and improved 
 (rewards or reasons for doing something) after policy changes is clearly important, as 
 is higher rainfall in some areas, reduced population 
 growth, and relative political (firm and steady nature/lasting nature/strength). But Africa's 
 success in increasing average cereal produces /gives up also points 
 to an untold story of successful technology development and move (from one place to another), as farmers adopt more and more productive seed varieties and production ways of doing things. 
 Some of the (process by which something becomes stronger or worse) watched/followed after 1984 
 involves pre-existing ways of doing things that were used more 
 intensively after policy reform changed farmers' 
 (rewards or reasons for doing something). But the mid-1980s also saw the (existing all over a large area) 
 release of new grain varieties and (producing crops/helping something grow) ways of doing things developed by African (people who work to find information) and their across-the-ocean partners. It was only in the 1970s that many 
 research programs began to focus on food crops or on 
 smallholders in not important areas, and farming-based 
 research programs often take 10 or more years to bear 
 fruit. The exact length of time of research and extension 
 effort differs/changes widely by program, but across Africa and 
 in the Sahel, the fruits of the first after-Independence 
 research programs began to reach farmers only in the 
 mid-1980s.

 3. Case studies of farming-based research hits/effects 
 To test the (thing that's given/work that's done) of research to Africa's 
 farming-based recovery and money-based growth, it is helpful to go ahead on a case-study basis, with hit/effect 
 tests of individual research programs. Since 
 1993, the authors have given training and technical 
 help to fellow workers in many national farming-based research services, and cooperated directly on a 
 number of studies across the continent. 
 In this paper, to present as large a sample of case 
 studies as possible, we provide rate-of-return guesses from other similar studies next to our 
 own research. This collection updates previous surveys of research hits/effects in Africa (Oehmke and 
 Crawford, 1996), permitting comparison with results 
 for the world as a whole (Echeverria, 1990; Evenson 
 et al., 1979). 
 Guesses from 11 analyses done before 1993 are 
 summarized in Table 1, while Table 2 summarizes the 
 results of 21 case studies completed since then. Most 
 of these 32 studies were never published, as they were 
 written for and circulated among an audience of 
 specialists in a particular country. Maybe the most 
 striking result of this collection is that, of the 32 
 studies we found, only 8 report rates of return below 
 20%-and the costs of these relative failures would be 
 more than offset by the many cases of very high 
 returns. 
 The research programs talked about in these studies 
 may not be a random sample of research activity, but

 they cover programs facing heavy criticism, as well as 
 those seen as successful, and include a broad crosssection of the major types of research programs. Our 
 collection confirms that returns to research in Africa 
 are almost the same  those found in other places, showing high payoffs for a wide range of programs. The (thing that's given/work that's done) of 
 research to farming-based performance and money-based 
 growth is not obvious, since it happens slowly, and is 
 spread widely across the population, but the net 
 benefits are significantly larger than the money/giving money (to) gave/given. 
 A striking result from our collection is that the 
 research failures are often-but not always-in the 
 hardest agroecological areas. A few competing guesses could explain this result. The first and 
 maybe most in control/most common view is that payoffs tend to be lower 
 in lower-possible areas because (the health of the Earth/the surrounding conditions)'s 
 low reserves of soil and water limit any possible 
 production increases. A second and more detailed 
 view would be that those working well-improving 
 
 inventions of new things, which are discovered in these areas, 
 are limited in their (ability to be used for something), due to the (many different kinds of people or things) of 
 micro-(surrounding conditions) found in low-rainfall areas. A 
 third explanation would involve the political-(process of people making, selling, and buying things) 
 problems of these areas, where weak governments are 
 often unable to provide key public products (that are bought and sold). But all of 
 these guesses are argued by the sustained 
 yield increases watched/followed for the Sahel in Figs. 2 and 3 
 above, which shows that sustained working well 
 growth is possible even in that very harsh (surrounding conditions). 
 Maybe the most interesting general explanation 
 for some programs' failure is simply that local institutions had not (yet) found the right mix of activities to 
 produce (producing a lot for a given amount of money) technologies in those locations. 
 For example, on Table 1, the very low rate of return to 
 research in Niger found by Mazzucato and Ly (1992) 
 can be connected with that country's very weak seedmultiplication system, which effectively prevented the 
 (existing all over a large area) spreading around of new varieties. On

 Table 2, the (compared to other things) low gains from a project to 
 (help increase/show in a good way) stone dikes in Burkina Paso recorded/supported by 
 Ouedraogo and Illy (1996) can be connected with that 
 project's provision of credit to farmers for the (instance of buying something for money) of rock phosphate to go with the stone dikes, 
 which accounted for a big part of the project's costs, but may have added/have given little to its 
 benefits. In these and other cases, described/explained hit/effect 
 tests provide key lessons for the design of 
 future projects, but provide no (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) that research 
 itself is unproductive. In fact, (even though there is the existence of) the late start and 
 occasional failures of Africa's foodcrop research programs, case studies provide (enough information or physical objects that clearly prove something) that highimpact inventions of new things are now newly appearing in all of Africa's 
 agroclimatic zones.

 Mrican research, like almost the same  efforts in other places, does 
 yield great money-based gains in terms of the level and 
 (firm and steady nature/lasting nature/strength) of farmers' income, and in terms of national 
 money-based growth.

 in (serving to compare two or more things) (way of seeing things / sensible view of what is and is not important) 
 
 The group and case-study (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) presented 
 here helps explain why working well growth in Africa 
 has happened later and less very much than the 
 'green revolution' in Asia and Latin America. Africa's 
 farming-based (process by which something becomes stronger or worse) in the late 1980s and 1990s 
 shares some features of the earlier changes in Asian 
 and Latin American farming, famously the increased 
 use of labor and (bought something for money) inputs to sustain higher 
 yields per hectare. But there are also major differences, and Africa's working well growth is clearly less 
 visible in farmers' fields or off-farm markets. In 
 particular, much working well growth in the green 
 revolution areas of Asia and Latin America was driven 
 by the adoption of short-height (material that makes plants grow better)-(able to reply or react/quick to respond) 
 crop varieties, in the big picture  of relative moisture 
 (oversupply/large quantity)-and led to sharp rises in marketed extra 
 of food grains (Falcon, 1970). In contrast, much of 
 Mrica's working well growth has happened through 
 early-maturing varieties aimed (making steady/making firm and strong) yields in 
 short rainy seasons-and has happened in food-shortage 
 (surrounding conditions), where marketed extra consists of 
 animals, oilseeds, cotton and other products (Sanders 
 et al., 1995). This contrast hints that Africa's 
 working well growth was delayed in part simply 
 because the (connected/related) research happened (compared to other things) late, 
 and has been hidden from view simply because the 
 (connected/related) benefits are not easily watched/followed. Anyway, 
 the work reported here (shows or proves) convincingly that
