 ABSTRACT 
 Battese, G.E., 1992. Edge of something/unexplored area production functions and technical (wasting very little while working or producing something): a survey of 
 scientific applications in farming-based money flow/money-based studies. Agric. Econ., 7: 185-208. 
 The modelling and guess of edge of something/unexplored area production functions has been an important 
 area of econometric research during the last twenty years. Forsund, Lovell and Schmidt 
 (1980) and Schmidt (1986) present reviews of the ideas and models involved and refer to 
 some of the scientific applications which had appeared to their (pertaining to each person or thing) times of 
 (book, magazine, etc.). 
 This paper tries to update the econometric modelling of edge of something/unexplored area production functions 
 connected with the guess of technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) of individual firms. A survey of 
 scientific applications in farming-based money flow/money-based studies is an important part of the paper. 
 
 1. INTRODUCTION 
 
 In microeconomic explanation a production function is defined in terms of the 
 maximum output that can be produced from a specified set of inputs, given 
 the existing technology available to the firms involved. However, up until 
 the late 1960's, most scientific studies used traditional least-squares methCorrespondence to: G.E. Battese, Dep. Econometrics, University of New England, Armidale,

 This paper is a rewriting/redoing of that presented at the 35th Once-a-year Conference of the 
 Australian Farming-based Money flow (community of people/all good people in the world), University of New England, Armidale, 11-14

 ods to guess production functions. So the guessed functions could 
 be more appropriately described as response (or average) functions. 
 Econometric modelling of production functions, as usually/(in the past) defined, 
 was stimulated by the important paper of Farrell (1957). Given that the 
 production function to be guessed had constant returns to scale, Farrell 
 (1957) assumed that watched/followed input-per-unit-of-output values for firms 
 would be above the (what people commonly call a/not really a) unit isoquant. Figure 1 shows the situation in 
 which firms use two inputs of production, X 1 and X 2 , to produce their 
 output, Y, such that the points, defined by the input-per-unit-of-output 
 ratios, (X 1 jY, X 2 jY), are above the curve, II'. The unit isoquant defines 
 the input-per-unit-of-output ratios connected with the (producing the most with the least waste) use of 
 the inputs to produce the output involved. The moving away of watched/followed 
 input-per-unit-of-output ratios from the unit isoquant was carefully thought about/believed to be 
 connected with technical inefficiency of the firms involved. Farrell (1957) 
 defined the ratio, OB jOA, to be the technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) of the firm with 
 input-per-unit-of-output values at point A. 
 Farrell (1957) suggested that the (producing a lot with very little waste) unit isoquant be guessed by 
 programming methods such that the curving out function involved was never 
 above any of the watched/followed input-per-unit-of-output ratios. 
 A more general presentation of Farrell's idea  of the production 
 function (or edge of something/unexplored area) is shown in Fig. 2 involving the original input and 
 output values. The flat/left-and-right axis represents the (vector of) inputs, X, 
 connected with producing the output, Y. The watched/followed input-output values 
 are below the production edge of something/unexplored area, given that firms do not reach the 
 maximum output possible for the inputs involved, given the technology

 available. A measure of the technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) of the firm which produces 
 output, y, with inputs, x, represented by point A, is given by y /Y *, where y * 
 is the 'frontier output' connected with the level of inputs, x (see point B). 
 This is a measure of technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) which is (may or may not happen, depending on something) on the levels 
 of the inputs involved. 
 The existence of technical inefficiency of firms working at production 
 has been a subject of large amounts of debate in money flow/money-based studies. For example, 
 Muller (1974) states (p. 731): "However, little is known about the role of 
 non-physical inputs, especially information or knowledge, which influence 
 the firm's ability to use its available technology set fully .... This suggests 
 how relative and (not made by nature/fake) the idea  of the edge of something/unexplored area itself is. . . . Once all 
 inputs are taken into account, measured working well differences should 
 disappear except for random disturbances. In this case the edge of something/unexplored area and the 
 average function are identical. They only diverge if significant inputs have 
 been left out in the guess". Upton (1979) also raised important 
 problems connected with scientific production function analysis. However, 
 (even though there is the existence of) these criticisms, we believe that the econometric modelling of 
 edge of something/unexplored area production functions, which is surveyed below, provides useful 
 ideas of best-practice technology and measures by which the productive (wasting very little while working or producing something) of different firms may be compared. 
 2. ECONOMETRIC MODELS 
 
 Production edge of something/unexplored area models are reviewed in three sub-sections involving 
 pre-decided edges of something/unexplored areas, (random/including random data points) edges of something/unexplored areas and panel data models. For 
 
 188 
 
 G.E. BATTESE 
 
 convenience of explaining/big show, these models are presented such that the 
 (thing that changes (like a test score) because of something else that you control (like study time)) is the original output of the production process, represented by Y, which is assumed to be expressed in terms of the product of a 
 known function of a vector, x, of the inputs of production and a function of 
 unobservable random (numbers that change/things that change) and (random/including random data points) errors. 
 
 2.1 
 
 Pre-decided edges of something/unexplored areas 
 
 The pre-decided edge of something/unexplored area model is defined by: 
 i=1,2, ... ,N 
 Y; = f(x;; f3) exp( -u;) 
 (1) 
 where Y; represents the possible production level for the ith sample firm; 
 
 f(x;; 3{) is a good function (e.g., Cobb-Douglas or TRANSLOG) of the 
 vector, X;, of inputs for the ith firm and a vector, 3{, of unknown limits/guidelines; u; is a non-negative random (number or thing that changes) connected with firm-specific 
 factors which add/give to the ith firm not reaching highest (wasting very little while working or producing something) 
 of production; and N represents the number of firms involved in a 
 thin sliceal survey of the industry. 
 The presence of the non-negative random (number or thing that changes), u;, in model (1), is 
 connected with the technical inefficiency of the firm and hints that the 
 random (number or thing that changes), exp(- u;), has values between zero and one. This way it 
 follows that the possible production, Y;, is bounded above by the non-(random/including random data points) (i.e., pre-decided) amount, f(x;; 3{). So the model (1) is 
 referred to as a pre-decided edge of something/unexplored area production function. The (state where two things are not the same) 
 relationships: 
 i = 1, 2, ... , N 
 
 (2) 
 
 were first specified by Aigner and Chu (1968) in the big picture  of a CobbDouglas model. It was suggested that the limits/guidelines of the model be 
 guessed by applying linear or quadratic programming computer codes. Aigner 
 and Chu (1968) suggested (p. 838) that chance-held back programming 
 could be applied to the (state where two things are not the same) restrictions (2) so that some output 
 (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) could be permitted to lie above the guessed edge of something/unexplored area. Timmer (1971) took up this suggestion to get the (what people commonly call a/not really a) (related to the study of how likely or unlikely things are to happen) 
 edge of something/unexplored area production functions, for which a small proportion of the (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) is permitted to go beyond the edge of something/unexplored area. Although this feature was carefully thought about/believed desirable because of the likely (number of times something happens) of (something that's not part of the main group) (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements), it 
 obviously doesn't have any (related to studying numbers) or money-based reasons. 
 The edge of something/unexplored area model (1) was first presented by Afriat (1972, p. 576). 
 Richmond (1974) further thought about/believed the model under the idea (you think is true) that 
 u; had gamma distribution with limits/guidelines, r = n and A = 1 [see Mood, 
 Graybill and Boes (1974, p. 112)]_). Schmidt (1976) stated that the 
 
 FRONTIER PRODUCriON FUNCI'IONS 
 
 189 
 
 maximum-chance guesses for the J3-limits/guidelines of the model could be 
 received/got by linear and quadratic programming ways of doing things if the random 
 (numbers that change/things that change) had huge or half-(usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) distributions, (match up each pair of items in order). 1 
 The technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) of a given firm is defined to be the factor by 
 which the level of production for the firm is less than its edge of something/unexplored area output. 
 Given the pre-decided edge of something/unexplored area model (1), the edge of something/unexplored area output for the ith 
 firm is Y; * = f(x ;; J3) and so the technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) for the ith firm, 
 represented byTE;, is: 
 TE; = Y;/Y;* 
 = 
 
 f(x;; J3) exp( -U;)/f(x;; J3) 
 
 = exp(- U;) 
 
 (3) 
 
 Technical (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) for individual firms in the big picture  of the pre-decided edge of something/unexplored area production function (1) are (described the future) by getting the ratio of 
 the watched/followed production values to the similar guessed edge of something/unexplored area 
 values, TE; = Yjf(x;; #_#), where ti is either the maximum-chance estimator or the corrected ordinary least-squares (COLS) estimator for J3. 2 
 If the U;-random (numbers that change/things that change) of the pre-decided edge of something/unexplored area (1) have huge or half-(usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) distribution, guessing about the J3-limits/guidelines cannot 
 be gotten from the maximum-chance estimators because the wellknown (happening over and over again in a predictable way) conditions (see Theil, 1971, p. 392) are not made happy. 
 Greene (1980) presented (good) enough conditions for the distribution of the 
 U;'s for which the maximum-chance estimators have the usual asymptotic properties, upon which large-sample guessing for the J3-limits/guidelines 
 can be gotten. Greene (1980) proved that if the U;'s were independent 
 Given that the 3-limits/guidelines{ of model (1) are expressible as a linear function when 
 logarithms are taken, it follows that the maximum-chance guesses for the 3-limits/guidelines{ 
 when ll; has huge or half-(usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) distributions are defined by (making small) the 
 total sum or the sum of squares of the mistakes of the logarithms of production from 
 the similar edge of something/unexplored area values, subject to the linear restrictions received/got by applying 
 logarithms to (2). However, the non-negativity restrictions on the limit/guideline guesses, which 
 are (usually/ in a common and regular way) connected with linear and quadratic programming problems, are not needed/demanded. 
 Although non-negative guesses for the partial elasticities in Cobb-Douglas models are 
 generally reasonable, it does not follow that non-negativity restrictions should be applied for 
 such functional forms as the TRANSLOG model. 
 2 Given that the model (1) has the form of a linear model (with an (stopping or interfering with something)) when 
 logarithms are taken, then the COLS estimator for f3 is defined by the OLS estimators for 
 the coefficients of 3{, except the (stopping or interfering with something), and the OLS estimator for the (stopping or interfering with something) plus the 
 largest leftover/extra needed/demanded to make all mistakes of the production (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) from the 
 guessed edge of something/unexplored area non-positive. Greene (1980) showed that the COLS estimator is consistent, given that the ll;-random (numbers that change/things that change) are independent and identically distributed.

 and identically distributed as gamma random (numbers that change/things that change), with limits/guidelines 
 r &amp;gt; 2 and A &amp;gt; 0, then the needed/demanded (happening over and over again in a predictable way) conditions are happy. 
 2.2 
 
 (random/including random data points) edges of something/unexplored areas 
 
 The (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area production function is defined by: 
 Y; = f ( x;; 3{) exp ( 
 U;) 
 i = 1, 2, ... , N 
 ( 4) 
 where 
 is a random error having zero mean, which is related to 
 random factors (e.g., measurement errors in production, weather, industrial 
 action, etc.) not under the control of the firm. 
 This (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area model was independently proposed by Aigner, 
 Lovell and Schmidt (1977) and Meeusen and Van den Broeck (1977). The 
 model is such that the possible production, Y;, is bounded above by the 
 (random/including random data points) amount, f(x;; 3{) exp(V); so the term (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area. 
 The random errors, 
 i = 1, 2, ... , N, were assumed to be independently 
 and identically distributed as N(O, cr3) random (numbers that change/things that change), independent of 
 the U;'s, which were assumed to be non-negative cutting offs of the N(O, cr 2 ) 
 distribution (i.e., half-(usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) distribution) or have huge distribution. 
 Meeusen and Van den Broeck (1977) thought about/believed only the case in which the 
 U;'s had huge distribution (i.e., gamma distribution with limits/guidelines 
 r = 1 and A &amp;gt; 0) and noted that the model was not as (serving to severely limit or control) as the 
 one-limit/guideline gamma distribution (i.e., gamma distribution with limits/guidelines r = n and A= 1) thought about/believed by Richmond (1974). 
 The basic structure of the (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area model (4) is shown in Fig. 
 3 in which the productive activities of two firms, represented by i and j, are 
 carefully thought about/believed. Firm i uses inputs with values given by (the vector) X; and 
 gets the output, Y;, but the edge of something/unexplored area output, Y; *, goes beyond the value on 
 the pre-decided production function, f(x;; 3{), because its productive 
 activity is related to 'favourable' conditions for which the random 
 error, V;, is positive. However, firm j uses inputs with values given by (the 
 vector) xj and gets the output, Yj, which has corresponding edge of something/unexplored area 
 output, Yj *, which is less than the value on the pre-decided production 
 function, f(xj; 3{), because its productive activity is related to 'unfavourable' conditions for which the random error, Vj, is negative. In both 
 cases the watched/followed production values are less than the similar 
 edge of something/unexplored area values, but the (unobservable) edge of something/unexplored area production values would lie 
 around the pre-decided production function connected with the firms 
 involved. 3

 Given the ideas (you think are true) of the (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area model (4), guessing 
 about the limits/guidelines of the model can be based on the maximum-chance estimators because the standard (happening over and over again in a predictable way) conditions hold. Aigner, 
 Lovell and Schmidt (1977) suggested that the maximum-chance guesses of the limits/guidelines of the model be gotten in terms of the 
 limit/guidelineization, o-&#126; + o- 2 = a-J and A= a- fo-v. Rather than use the nonnegative limit/guideline, A (i.e., the ratio of the standard moving away of the 
 N(O, o- 2 ) distribution involved in specifying the distribution of the nonnegative U;'s to the standard moving away of the matching errors, V), Battese 
 and Carra (1977) thought about/believed the limit/guideline, y = o- 2 j(o-l + o- 2 ), which is 
 bounded between zero and one. 
 Technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) of an individual firm is defined in terms of the ratio 
 of the watched/followed output to the similar edge of something/unexplored area output, (may or may not happen, depending on something) on 
 the levels of inputs used by that firm. 4 This way the technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) of firm 
 i in the big picture  of the (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area production function (4) is the 
 
 4 Battese and Coelli (1988) suggest (p. 389) that the technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) of firm i, connected 
 with a panel data model with time-invariant firm effects, be defined as the ratio of its mean 
 production, (may or may not happen, depending on something) on its levels of inputs and its (understood/made real/achieved) firm effect, U;, to the 
 corresponding mean production if the firm effect, U;, had value zero (and so the firm was 
 fully (producing a lot with very little waste)). This definition yields the same measure of technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) as that given 
 in the text.

 Although the technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) of a firm connected with the pre-decided and (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area models are the same, it is important to note 
 that they have different values for the two models. (thinking about/when one thinks about) Fig. 3, it is 
 obvious that the technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) of firm j is greater under the (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area model than for the pre-decided edge of something/unexplored area, (in other words), Oj/}j*) &amp;gt; 
 [}j/f(xj; 3{)]_). That is, firm j is judged technically (producing more with less waste) relative to 
 the bad/unhelpful conditions connected with its productive activity (i.e., 
 &#126; &amp;lt; 0) than if its production is judged relative to the highest connected 
 with the value of the pre-decided function, f(xj; 3{). Further, firm i is 
 judged technically less (producing a lot with very little waste) relative to its good/willing conditions than if 
 its production is judged relative to the highest connected with the value 
 of the pre-decided function, f(x;; 3{). However, for a given set of data, the 
 guessed technical (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) received/got by fitting a pre-decided edge of something/unexplored area 
 will be less than those received/got by fitting a (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area, because the 
 pre-decided edge of something/unexplored area will be guessed so that no output values will go beyond 
 it. 
 Stevenson (1980) suggested that an different model for the &#126;'s in the 
 (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area (4) was the non-negative cutting off of the N(f.L, a- 2 ) 
 distribution. This (big statement based on very little information) includes the cases in which there may be 
 low chance of getting &#126;'s close to zero (i.e., when there is (large/relatively large) technical inefficiency present in the firms involved). 
 Aigner and Schmidt (1980) contains a few other important papers 
 dealing with the pre-decided and (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area models. 
 The (statement about the future) of the technical (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) of individual firms connected 
 with the (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area production function (4), defined by TE; = 
 exp(- U), i = 1, 2 ... , N, was carefully thought about/believed impossible until the appearance 
 of Jondrow, Lovell, Materov and Schmidt (1982). This paper focussed 
 attention on the (may or may not happen, depending on something) distribution of the non-negative random (number or thing that changes), &#126;' given that the random (number or thing that changes), E; = &#126;- &#126;, was (capable of being seen and known). 
 Jondrow et al. (1982) suggested that &#126; be (described the future) by the (may or may not happen, depending on something) 
 expectation of &#126;' given the value of the random (number or thing that changes), E; &#126; &#126;- This 
 expectation was received/made from for the cases that the &#126;'s had half-(usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) and 
 huge distributions. Jondrow et al. (1982) used 1 - E(&#126; I&#126;- &#126;) to 
 (describe the future) the technical inefficiency of the ith firm. However, given the 
 (related to multiplying numbers) production edge of something/unexplored area model (4), Battese and Coelli (1988)

 pointed out that the technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) of the ith firm, TEi exp(- U), is

 value of the random (number or thing that changes), Ei V; - &#126;- This latter result was calculated

 Panel data models 
 
 The pre-decided and (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area production functions (1) and 
 (4) are defined for thin sliceal data (i.e., data on a thin slice of N 
 firms at some particular time period). If time-series (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) are 
 available for the sample firms involved, then the data are referred to as 
 panel data. Pitt and Lee (1981) thought about/believed the guess of a (random/including random data points) 
 edge of something/unexplored area production function connected with N firms over T time periods. 
 The model is defined by: 
 &#126;,=[(xu; 
 
 f3) exp(V;,- 
 
 &#126;1 ) 
 
 i= 1, 2, ... ,N 
 t = 1, 2, ... , T 
 
 (5) 
 
 where &#126;&#126; represents the possible production for the ith firm at the tth 
 time period. 
 Pitt and Lee (1981) thought about/believed three basic models, defined in terms of 
 the ideas (you think are true) made about the non-negative &#126;/s. Model I assumed that 
 the &#126;/s were time-invariant effects, (in other words), &#126;&#126; = &#126;' t = 1, 2, ... , T. Model II 
 specified that the &#126;/s were uncorrelated. Model III permitted the &#126;/s to 
 be related for given firms. 5 
 The time-invariant model for the non-negative firm effects was carefully thought about/believed by Battese and Coelli (1988) for the case in which the firm effects 
 were non-negative cutting offs of the N(f.J-, 17 2 ) distribution. Battese, Coelli 
 and Colby (1989) thought about/believed the case in which the numbers of time-series 
 (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) on the different firms were not all equal. Coelli (1989) wrote 
 the computer program, FRONTIER, for getting the maximum-chance guesses and the (statements about the future) for the technical (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) of the 
 firms involved. 
 More (not very long ago) (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area models for panel data have been 
 presented in which time-changing/different firm effects have been specified. Cornwell, 
 Schmidt and Sickles (1990) thought about/believed a panel data model in which the 
 firm effects at different time periods were a quadratic function of time, in 
 Pitt and Lee (1981, p. 46) wrongly defined Model II as specifying E(U;, Lf;,,)=O i=j 
 and t=t'. Model III is defined by Cov(U;,,Cf;,,)=u11 , and Cov(U;,Lf;,,)=O if ii=j= 
 1,2, ... ,N.

 which the coefficients varied over firms according to the (detailed descriptions of exactly what is required) of a 
 multivariate distribution. The limits/guidelines of the model were guessed 
 using instrumental-changeable methods. 
 Kumbhakar (1990) presented a model in which the non-negative firm 
 effects, &#126;&#126;, were the product of an huge function of time (involving 
 two limits/guidelines) and a time-invariant (non-negative) random (number or thing that changes). This 
 latter model permits the time-different firm effects to be boring voice decreasing (or increasing) or curving out (or curved) functions over time [i.e., the 
 technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) of firms in the industry involved could monotonically 
 increase (or decrease) or increase and then decrease (or the other way around, too)]_). 
 Battese and Coelli (1992) suggested a time-different firm produces model for 
 incomplete panel data, such that the technical (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) of firms either 
 monotonically increased or decreased or remained constant over time. This 
 time-different model assumes that the firm effects are an huge function of time which involves only one added/more limit/guideline to the time-invariant model of Battese and Coelli (1988). 
 3. EMPIRICAL APPLICATIONS 
 
 Edge of something/unexplored area production function models have been applied in a (large/relatively large) 
 number of scientific studies in farming-based money flow/money-based studies. (books, magazines, etc.) have 
 appeared in the all major farming-based money flow/money-based studies journals and a lot of other money-based journals. The Journal of Farming-based Money flow has published the most papers (at least seven, referred to below) dealing 
 with edge of something/unexplored area production functions. Other journals which have published at 
 least two applied production edge of something/unexplored area papers are the Canadian Journal of 
 Farming-based Money flow (4), the American Journal of Farming-based Money flow 
 (2) and the Southern Journal of Farming-based Money flow (2). At least one 
 edge of something/unexplored area production function paper involving farm-level data has appeared 
 in the Australian Journal of Farming-based Money flow, the (related to Europe) Review 
 of Farming-based Money flow, the North Central Journal of Farming-based Money flow and the Western Journal of Farming-based Money flow. A few papers 
 have appeared in development money flow/money-based studies journals as well as econometric 
 and other applied money flow/money-based studies journals. 
 The scientific studies are surveyed under the three headings involved in 
 the above section, depending on the type of edge of something/unexplored area production function 
 guessed. 
 
 3.1 
 
 Pre-decided edges of something/unexplored areas 
 
 Russell and Young (1983) guessed a pre-decided Cobb-Douglas 
 edge of something/unexplored area using corrected ordinary least-squares moving backward with a cross-sec-

 tion of 56 farms in the North-West area of England during 1977-78. The 
 (thing that changes (like a test score) because of something else that you control (like study time)) was total money/money income received/got from the crop, animals and 
 miscellaneous activities on the farms involved. Technical (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) for 
 the individual farms were gotten using both the Timmer and Kopp 
 measures. 6 These two measures of technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) gave about 
 the same values and the same rankings for the 56 farms involved. The 
 Timmer technical (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) ranged from 0.42 to 1.00, with average 0.73 
 and sample standard moving away 0.11. Russell and Young (1983) did not 
 make any strong ends/end results as to the policy effects/results/suggestions of these results. 
 Kontos and Young (1983) managed and did/done almost the same  edge of something/unexplored area analyses to those of 
 Russell and Young (1983) for a data set for 83 Greek farms for the 
 1980-81 harvest year. Kontos and Young (1983) applied a Box-Cox change to the (numbers that change/things that change) of the model and received/got almost the same  elasticities to 
 those received/got by guessing the Cobb-Douglas production function by 
 ordinary least-squares moving backward. Since the chance ratio test pointed to/showed 
 that the Box-Cox model was not very different from the usual 
 Cobb-Douglas model, the pre-decided edge of something/unexplored area model was guessed by 
 corrected ordinary least-squares moving backward. The guessed edge of something/unexplored area model 
 was used to get the values of the Kopp measure of technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) 
 for the individual farms involved. These technical (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) ranged from 
 about 0.30 to 1.00, with an average of 0.57, pointing to/showing that (large/relatively large) 
 technical inefficiencies existed in the Greek farms surveyed. 
 Dawson (1985) analysed 4 years of data for the 56 farms involved in the 
 paper by Russell and Young (1983). Three estimators for the technical 
 (wasting very little while working or producing something) of the individual farms were presented which involved a two-step, 
 ordinary least-squares procedure, an analysis-of-covariance method and the 
 linear programming procedure suggested by Aigner and Chu (1968). The 
 technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) measures received/got by the three methods showed wide 
 difference/different version and the guessed relationship coefficients were quite small. Dawson (1985) claimed that there was indication that the technical (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) 
 were directly related to the size of the farm operation. 
 Taylor, Drummond and Gomes (1986) thought about/believed a pre-decided 
 Cobb-Douglas edge of something/unexplored area production function for Brazilian farmers to (ask lots of questions about/try to find the truth about) the effectiveness of a World Bank sponsored farming-based credit 
 programme in the State of Minas Gerais. The limits/guidelines of the edge of something/unexplored area 
 The Timmer measure of technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) is the measure discussed above in Section 3. 
 The Kopp measure of technical (wasting very little while working or producing something), introduced by Kopp (1981), involves the ratio of 
 the edge of something/unexplored area input levels which would be needed/demanded to produce the watched/followed level of output 
 (the input ratios being constant) if the farm was fully technically (producing a lot with very little waste), to the actual 
 input levels used. These two measures are not equal unless the production edge of something/unexplored area has 
 constant returns to scale.

 model were guessed by corrected ordinary least-squares moving backward and 
 the maximum-chance method under the idea (you think is true) that the non-negative farm effects had gamma distribution. The authors did not report 
 guesses for different edge of something/unexplored area functions for person (who was part of a study, etc.) and non-person (who was part of a study, etc.) farmers in the farming-based credit programme and test if the 
 edges of something/unexplored areas were (group of things that are all pretty much the same). It appears that the technical (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) of 
 person (who was part of a study, etc.) and non-person (who was part of a study, etc.) farmers were guessed from the common 
 production edge of something/unexplored area reported in the paper. The average technical (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) for person (who was part of a study, etc.) and non-person (who was part of a study, etc.) farmers were reported to be 0.18 
 and 0.17, (match up each pair of items in order). 7 The authors decided that these values were not 
 very different and that the farming-based credit programme did not 
 appear to have any significant effect on the technical (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) of 
 person (who was part of a study, etc.) farmers. 
 Bravo-Ureta (1986) guessed the technical (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) of dairy farms in 
 the New England area of the United States using a pre-decided CobbDouglas edge of something/unexplored area production function. The limits/guidelines of the production 
 edge of something/unexplored area were guessed by linear programming methods involving the 
 (related to the study of how likely or unlikely things are to happen) edge of something/unexplored area approach. Using the 96% (related to the study of how likely or unlikely things are to happen) edge of something/unexplored area guesses, Bravo-Ureta (1986) received/got technical (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) which ranged 
 from 0.58 to 1.00, with an average of 0.82. He decided that technical 
 (wasting very little while working or producing something) of individual farms was (related to numbers) independent of size of the 
 dairy farm operation, as measured by the number of cows. 
 Aly, Belbase, Grabowski and Kraft (1987) (examined closely) the technical 
 (wasting very little while working or producing something) of a sample of Illinois grain farms by using a pre-decided 
 edge of something/unexplored area production function of ray-homothetic type. The authors presented 
 a well-said summary of the different approaches to edge of something/unexplored area production 
 functions, including (random/including random data points) edges of something/unexplored areas. The pre-decided ray-homothetic 
 edge of something/unexplored area, which was guessed by corrected ordinary least-squares moving backward, had the output and input (numbers that change/things that change) expressed in money/money income terms rather 
 than in physical units. So the technical (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) also reflected 
 allocative (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste). The mean technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) for the 88 grain farms 
 involved was 0.58 which pointed to/showed that (large/relatively large) inefficiency existed in 
 Illinois grain farms. The authors found that larger farms tended to be more 
 technically (producing a lot with very little waste) than smaller ones, ignoring whether land 
 helped grow or gross money/money income was used to classify the farms by size of 
 operation. 
 
 If Taylor, Drummond and Gomes (1986) had guessed separate production edges of something/unexplored areas for 
 person (who was part of a study, etc.) and non-person (who was part of a study, etc.) farmers, then the mean technical (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) of the farmers 
 in the different groups could be guessed by [A /(A+ 1)]', where A and r are the 
 limits/guidelines of the gamma distribution involved.

 Ali and Chaudhry (1990) guessed pre-decided edge of something/unexplored area production 
 functions in their analyses of a thin slice of farms in four areas of 
 Pakistan's Punjab. The limits/guidelines of the Cobb-Douglas edge of something/unexplored area functions 
 for the four areas were guessed by linear programming methods. 
 Although the edge of something/unexplored area functions were not (group of things that are all pretty much the same) among the different areas, the technical (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) in the four areas ranged from 0.80 
 to 0.87 but did not appear to be very different. 
 
 3.2 
 
 (random/including random data points) edges of something/unexplored areas 
 
 Aigner, Lovell and Schmidt (1977) applied the (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area production function in the analysis of aggregative data on the U.S. first (or most important) 
 metals industry (involving 28 states) and US farming-based data for 6 years 
 and the 48 (covering the same area; being the same length, size, etc.) states. For these applications, the (random/including random data points) 
 edge of something/unexplored area was not very different from the average response function. 
 Almost the same  results were gotten by Meeusen and Van den Broeck (1977) in 
 their analyses for ten French manufacturing businesses. 8 
 The first application of the (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area model to farm-level 
 farming-based data was presented by Battese and Corra (1977). Data from the 
 1973-74 Australian Grazing Industry Survey were used to guess pre-decided and (random/including random data points) Cobb-Douglas production edges of something/unexplored areas for the three 
 states included in the Peaceful/church-related Zone of Eastern Australia. The variance of 
 the farm effects was found to be a highly significant proportion of the total 
 (quality of changing over time or at different places) of the logarithm of the value of sheep production in all states. 
 The y-limit/guideline guesses went beyond 0.95 in all cases. So the (random/including random data points) 
 edge of something/unexplored area production functions were very different from their corresponding pre-decided edges of something/unexplored areas. Technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) of farms in the areas was not talked about in Battese and Corra (1977). 
 Kalirajan (1981) guessed a (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area Cobb-Douglas production function using data from 70 rice farmers for the rabi season in a 
 district in India. The variance of farm effects was found to be a highly 
 significant part in describing the (quality of changing over time or at different places) of rice yields (the guess for the y-limit/guideline was 0.81). Kalirajan (1981) went ahead to (ask lots of questions about/try to find the truth about) the relationship between the difference between the guessed 'maximum yield function' and the watched/followed rice produces and such (numbers that change/things that change) as 
 farmer's experience, educational level, number of visits by extension workSince that time there have been a large number of scientific uses of the (random/including random data points) 
 edge of something/unexplored area model in production and cost functions involving industrial and manufacturing 
 businesses in which the model was very different from the average response function 
 and the similar pre-decided edge of something/unexplored area. These are not included in this survey.

 ers, etc. 9 In this second-stage analysis, 1 Kalirajan (1981) noted the policy 
 effects/results/suggestions of these findings for improving crop yields of farmers. 
 Kalirajan (1982) guessed a almost the same  (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area production function to that in Kalirajan (1981) in the analysis of data from 91 rice farmers 
 for the kharif season in the same district of India as in his earlier paper. 
 The farm effects in the model were again found to be very highly significant (with y = 0.93). 
 Bagi (1982a) used the (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area Cobb-Douglas production 
 function model to decide/figure out whether there were any a big differences 
 in the technical (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) of small and large crop and mixed-business/project 
 farms in West Tennessee.' The (quality of changing over time or at different places) of farm effects were found to be 
 highly significant and the mean technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) of mixed-business/project 
 farms was smaller than that for crop farms (about 0.76 against/compared to/or 0.85, 
 (match up each pair of items in order)). However, there did not appear to be a big differences in 
 mean technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) for small and large farms, ignoring whether 
 the farms were classified according to land or value of farm sales. 11 
 Bagi (1984) thought about/believed the same data set as in Bagi (1982a) to (ask lots of questions about/try to find the truth about) 
 whether there were any a big differences in the mean technical 
 (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) of part-time and full-time farmers. No a big differences 
 were seen/obvious, ignoring whether the part-time and full-time farmers 
 were working at mixed farming or crop-only farms. 
 Bagi and Huang (1983) guessed a translogarithmic (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area 
 production function using the same data on the Tennessee farms thought about/believed in Bagi (1982a). The Cobb-Douglas (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area model was 
 found not to be an (good) enough representation of the data, given the (detailed descriptions of exactly what is required) of the translog model for both crop and mixed farms. The limits/guidelines 
 
 9 It is possible for watched/followed yield to go beyond the similar value of the ' highest yield 
 function' because the last thing just mentioned is received/got by using the guessed f3-limits/guidelines of the 
 (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area production function. Negative differences are clearly reported in 
 Kalirajan (1982) in Table 2 (p. 233). Under the ideas (you think are true) of the (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area 
 production function (4) the watched/followed yields cannot go beyond the similar (random/including random data points) 
 edge of something/unexplored area yields, but the last thing just mentioned are not (capable of being seen and known) values. 
 10 Kalirajan (1981, p. 289) states that the limits/guidelines of the second-stage model involving 
 differences between guessed maximum produces and watched/followed yields were guessed by the 
 maximum-chance method connected with the (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area model. However, the 
 ideas (you think are true) of the (random/including random data points) model (4) would not hold when the guessed yield function 
 from the first-stage analysis is involved. 
 11 Bagi (in a mistaken way) (p. 142) claimed that the guess for the y-limit/guideline in the (random/including random data points) 
 edge of something/unexplored area model [see the reference to Battese and Corra (1977) in Section 2(ii) above] of 0.72 
 hints that 72% of the mistake between the watched/followed and maximum (edge of something/unexplored area) output 
 results from technical inefficiency.

 of the model were guessed by corrected ordinary least-squares moving backward. 
 The mean technical (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) of crop and mixed farms were guessed to 
 be 0.73 and 0.67, (match up each pair of items in order). Individual technical (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) of the farms 
 were (described the future) using the (describe the future)or exp(- &#126;), where &#126; is the guessed 
 (may or may not happen, depending on something) mean of the ith farm effect (suggested by Jondrow, Lovell, 
 Materov and Schmidt, 1982). These technical (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) varied from 0.35 
 to 0.92 for mixed farms and 0.52 to 0.91 for crop farms. 
 Bagi (1982b) included scientific results on the guess of a translog 
 (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area production function using data from 34 share cropping 
 farms in India. The limits/guidelines of the model were guessed using corrected ordinary least-squares moving backward. The Cobb-Douglas functional 
 form was judged not to be an (good) enough representation of the data given the 
 ideas (you think are true) of the translog model. For these Indian farm data, the 
 variance of the non-negative farm effects was only a small proportion of the 
 total variance of farm outputs ( .Y = 0.15). The individual farm technical 
 (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) were (described the future) to be between 0.92 and 0.95. These high 
 technical (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) are agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with the (compared to other things) low variance of farm 
 effects which hints that the (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area and the average production function are expected to be quite almost the same. 
 Kalirajan and Flinn (1983) organized and listed the way(s) of doing things by which the 
 individual firm effects can be (described the future) (as discussed above with reference 
 to Jondrow et al., 1982) and applied the approach in their analysis of data 
 on 79 rice farmers in the Philippines. A translog (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area production function was assumed to explain the difference/different version in rice output in terms 
 of a few input (numbers that change/things that change). The limits/guidelines of the model were guessed by 
 the method of maximum chance. The Cobb-Douglas model was found 
 to be an not enough representation for the farm-level data. The individual 
 technical (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) ranged from 0.38 to 0.91. The (described the future) technical 
 (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) were moved backward on a few farm-level (numbers that change/things that change) and farmerspecific (features/ qualities/ traits). It was decided that the practice of transplanting 
 rice seedlings, (number of times something happens) of (the adding of things to soil to make plants grow better), years of farming and number of 
 extension contacts had big influence on the difference/different version of the guessed farm technical (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste). 
 Huang and Bagi (1984) assumed a changed translogarithmic (random/including random data points) 
 edge of something/unexplored area production function to guess the technical (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) of individual farms in India. It was found that the Cobb-Douglas (random/including random data points) 
 edge of something/unexplored area was not an (good) enough representation for describing the value of 
 farm products, given the (detailed descriptions of exactly what is required) of the translog model. The variance 
 of the random effects was a significant part of the (quality of changing over time or at different places) of 
 value of farm outputs. Individual technical (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) ranged from about 
 0.75 to 0.95, but there appeared to be no a big differences in the 
 technical (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) of small and large farms.

 Taylor and Shonkwiler (1986) guessed both pre-decided and (random/including random data points) production edges of something/unexplored areas of Cobb-Douglas type for people (who were part of a study, etc.) and nonparticipants of the World Bank sponsored credit programme (PRODEMATA) for farmers in Brazil. The limits/guidelines of the edges of something/unexplored areas involved 
 were guessed by maximum-chance methods, given the ideas (you think are true) 
 that the farm effects had gamma distribution in the pre-decided edge of something/unexplored area 
 and half-(usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) for the (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area. The authors did not report that 
 (related to studying numbers) tests had been managed and did/done on the evenness of the edges of something/unexplored areas for 
 people (who were part of a study, etc.) and non-person (who was part of a study, etc.) farmers. Farm-level technical (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) 
 were guessed for all the edges of something/unexplored areas, as suggested by Jondrow et al. (1982). 
 Given the (random/including random data points) edges of something/unexplored areas, the average technical (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) for people (who were part of a study, etc.) and non-people (who were part of a study, etc.) were 0.714 and 0.704, (match up each pair of items in order), and were not 
 very different. However, given the ideas (you think are true) of the pre-decided 
 edges of something/unexplored areas, the average technical (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) were 0.185 and 0.059, (match up each pair of items in order), and were very different. Taylor and Shonkwiler (1986) decided that their results pointed to/showed somewhat confusing results as to the 
 hit/effect of the PRODEMATA Â·programme on person (who was part of a study, etc.) farmers in 
 Brazil. 12 
 Huang, Tang and Bagi (1986) adopted a (random/including random data points) profit function 
 approach to (ask lots of questions about/try to find the truth about) the money-based (wasting very little while working or producing something) of small and large farms in 
 two states in India. The (quality of changing over time or at different places) of farm effects was highly significant and 
 individual farm money-based (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) tended to be greater for large farms 
 than small farms (the average money-based (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) being 0.84 and 0.80 for 
 large and small farms, (match up each pair of items in order)). The authors also thought about/believed the 
 desire/decision of best demand for hired labour under conditions of 
 doubt. 
 Kalirajan and Shand (1986) (examined closely) the technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) of rice 
 farmers within and without the Kemubu Crop-watering/rinsing with water Project in Malaysia 
 during 1980. Given the (detailed descriptions of exactly what is required) of a translog (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area 
 production function for the output of the rice farmers, the Cobb-Douglas 
 model was not an (good) enough representation of the data. Maximum-chance methods were used for guess of the limits/guidelines of the models 
 and the edges of something/unexplored areas for the two groups of farmers were very different. 
 Kalirajan and Shand (1986) reported that the individual technical (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) ranged from about 0.40 to 0.90, such that the (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) for those 
 12 However, given the (compared to other things) large guessed standard errors for the variances of the 
 random errors in the (random/including random data points) edges of something/unexplored areas, it may be the case that the (random/including random data points) model is not 
 very different from the pre-decided model. Because of this this would suggest that the 
 results received/got from the pre-decided edges of something/unexplored areas are more encouraging as to the positive 
 hit/effect of the credit programme on person (who was part of a study, etc.) farmers, even though the total levels of 
 technical (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) were quite small.

 outside the Kemubu Crop-watering/rinsing with water Project were (a) little narrower. They decided that their results pointed to/showed that the introduction of new technology 
 for farmers does not necessarily result in increased (a lot) technical 
 (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) over those for traditional farmers. 
 Ekanayake and Jayasuriya (1987) guessed both pre-decided and 
 (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area production functions of Cobb-Douglas type for two 
 groups of rice farmers in an watered area in Sri Skinnya. The limits/guidelines of 
 the two edges of something/unexplored areas were guessed by maximum-chance and corrected 
 ordinary least-squares methods. In only the 'tail reach' watered area, the 
 (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area appeared to be very different from the pre-decided model. Individual farm technical (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) were guessed for both 
 areas. The guesses received/got for the farms in the 'head reach' area (for 
 which the (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area appeared not to be very different from 
 the pre-decided edge of something/unexplored area) were hugely different for the two different 
 (random/including random data points) edges of something/unexplored areas. These results are not obviously reasonable. 
 Ekayanake (1987) 13 further discusses the data thought about/believed by Ekanayake 
 and Jayasuriya (1987) and used moving backward analysis to decide/figure out the 
 farmer-clearly stated/particular (numbers that change/things that change) which had significant effects in describing the 
 (quality of changing over time or at different places) in the individual farm technical (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) in the 'tail reach' of 
 the crop-watering/rinsing with water area involved. Allocative (wasting very little while working or producing something) was also thought about/believed in the 
 scientific analysis. 
 Kalirajan (1989) (described the future) technical (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) of individual farmers 
 (which he called "human capital") involved in rice production in two 
 areas in the Philippines in 1984-85. A Cobb-Douglas (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area 
 model was assumed to be appropriate in the scientific analysis. The 
 (described the future) technical (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) were moved backward on a few farm- and 
 farmer-clearly stated/particular (numbers that change/things that change) to discover what (numbers that change/things that change) had significant effects 
 on the difference/different version in the technical (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste). 
 Ali and Flinn (1989) guessed a (random/including random data points) profit edge of something/unexplored area of changed 
 translog type 14 for Basmati rice farmers in Pakistan's Punjab. After 
 guessing the technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) of individual farmers, the losses in (money made/good thing received) 
 due to technical inefficiency were gotten and moved backward on different 
 farmer- and farm-clearly stated/particular (numbers that change/things that change). Factors which were significant in 
 describing the (quality of changing over time or at different places) in profit losses were level of education, off-farm 
 employment, unavailability of credit and different restrictions connected with 
 crop-watering/rinsing with water and (material that makes plants grow better) application. 
 13 The author was wrongly listed as S.A.B. Ekayanake by the Journal of Development 
 Studies. The correct spelling of the author's name is "Ekanayake". 
 I 4 Ali and Flinn (1989) deleted (numbers that change/things that change) in the translog (random/including random data points) profit edge of something/unexplored area which had

 recommended applied econometric way(s) of doing things.

 Dawson and Lingard (1989) used a Cobb-Douglas (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area 
 production function to guess technical (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) of Philippine rice 
 farmers using four years of data. The four (random/including random data points) edges of something/unexplored areas guessed 
 were very different from the similar pre-decided edges of something/unexplored areas, 
 but the authors did not put into use any panel-data approach or test if the 
 edges of something/unexplored areas had (group of things that are all pretty much the same) elasticities. The individual technical (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) 
 ranged between 0.10 and 0.99, with the means between 0.60 and 0.70 for 
 the 4 years involved. 
 Bailey, Biswas, Kumbhakar and Schulthies (1989) guessed a (random/including random data points) 
 model involving technical, allocative and scale inefficiencies for thin sliceal data on 68 Ecuadorian dairy farms. The technical inefficiencies of 
 individual farms were about 12%, with little difference/different version being displayed by 
 individual farms. However, the authors found that the losses in (money made/good things received) due 
 to technical inefficiencies ranged from 20% to 25%. 
 Kumbhakar, Biswas and Bailey (1989) used a system approach to guess technical, allocative and scale inefficiencies for Utah dairy farmers. 
 The (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area production function which was specified included 
 both endogenous and (coming from the outside of something) (numbers that change/things that change). The endogenous (numbers that change/things that change) included were labour (including family and hired labour) and capital (the 
 opportunity cost of capital expenses on the farm), whereas the (coming from the outside of something) 
 (numbers that change/things that change) included level of formal education, off-farm income and measures 
 of farm size for the farmers involved. Both types of explanatory (numbers that change/things that change) 
 were found to have significant effects on the difference/different version of farm production. 
 Technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) of farms was found to be positively related to farm 
 size. 
 Bravo-Ureta and Rieger (1990) guessed both pre-decided and 
 (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area production functions for a large sample of dairy farms in 
 the northeastern states of the U.S.A for the years 1982 and 1983. The 
 Cobb-Douglas functional form was assumed to be appropriate. The limits/guidelines of the pre-decided edges of something/unexplored areas were guessed by linear programming, corrected ordinary least-squares moving backward and maximum-chance 
 methods (assuming that the non-negative farm effects had gamma distribution). The (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area model was guessed by maximum-chance 
 ways of doing things (given that the farm effects had half-(usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) distribution). The 
 (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area model had significant farm effects for 1982 but it was 
 (based on what's seen or what seems obvious) not very different from the pre-decided edge of something/unexplored area in 
 1983. The guessed technical (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) of farms received/got from the three 
 different methods used for the pre-decided model showed (large/relatively large) 
 (quality of changing over time or at different places) but were generally less than those received/got by use of the 
 (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area model. However, Bravo-Ureta and Rieger (1990) found 
 that the technical (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) received/got by the different methods were 
 highly related and gave almost the same  ordinal rankings of the farms.

 Panel data models 
 
 Battese and Coelli (1988) applied their panel-data model in the analysis 
 of data for dairy farms in New South Wales and Victoria for the three 
 years - 1978-79, 1979-80 and 1980-81. Given the (detailed descriptions of exactly what is required) of the 
 (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area Cobb-Douglas production function involved, the guess that the non-negative farm effects had half-(usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) distribution 
 was rejected for both states. Individual farm technical (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) ranged 
 from 0.55 to 0.93 for New South Wales farms, whereas the range was 0.30 
 to 0.93 for Victorian farms. 
 Battese, Coelli and Colby (1989) guessed a (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area production function for farms in an Indian village for which data were available 
 for up to ten years. Although the (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area was significantly 
 different from the similar pre-decided edge of something/unexplored area, the guess that 
 the non-negative farm effects had half-(usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) distribution was not rejected. Technical (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) ranged from 0.66 to 0.91, with the mean 
 (wasting very little while working or producing something) guessed by 0.84. 
 Kalirajan and Shand (1989) guessed the time-invariant panel-data 
 model using data for Indian rice farmers over five in-a-row harvest 
 periods. The farm effects were found to be a highly significant part 
 of the (quality of changing over time or at different places) of rice output, given the (detailed descriptions of exactly what is required) of a translog 
 (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area production function. Individual technical (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) 
 were guessed to range from 0.64 to 0.91, with average 0.70. A moving backward 
 of the guessed technical (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) on farm-clearly stated/particular (numbers that change/things that change) pointed to/showed 
 that farming experience, level of education, access to credit and extension 
 contacts had big influences on the difference/different version of the farm (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste). 
 Battese and Coelli (1992) applied their panel-data model including 
 time-changing/different firm effects in the analysis of data for paddy farmers in an 
 Indian village who were watched/followed for up to ten years. Given the (detailed descriptions of exactly what is required) of a (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area production function with time-invariant limits/guidelines, the guess of time-invariant technical (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) of the 
 paddy farmers was rejected. However, given that a linear time (popular thing/general way things are going) was 
 included in the (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area model (Dummiesian neutral technical 
 change), then the guess of time-invariant technical (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) was 
 accepted. Also, the (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area production function with the 
 time (popular thing/general way things are going) included was not very different from the average response function (i.e., technical inefficiences could be thought about/believed (not there; not present) 
 from the model. 15 The scientific results were gotten using the computer 
 15 However, in other scientific applications of the time-different model which have been 
 conducted, including a time-trend (number or thing that changes) in the (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area production 
 function has not necessarily resulted in time-invariant technical inefficienies or the end/end result that technical inefficiency does not exist (see Battese and Tessema, 1992).

 Edge of something/unexplored area production functions have been applied in the analysis of 
 farm-level data in a large number of developed and developing countries.
