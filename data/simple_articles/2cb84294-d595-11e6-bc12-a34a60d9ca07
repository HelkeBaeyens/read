 Abstract 
 A shadow-price profit edge of something/unexplored area model is developed to examine production (wasting very little while working or producing something) of Chinese (away from cities) families in farming operations. 
 The model includes price distortions resulting from (not totally pure/not totally correct) market conditions and (how money affects people's lives) and institutional restrictions, but 
 keeps/holds the advantages of (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area properties. The shadow prices are received/made from through a generalized profit function guess. The 
 shadow-price profit edge of something/unexplored area is then guessed and an (wasting very little while working or producing something) index based on the guessed profit edge of something/unexplored area is figured out/calculated and rotten to 
 household (features/ qualities/ traits). Scientific results using data from China's (away from cities) Household Survey for 1991 reject the neoclassical profit 
 (biggest increase/best possible extent) guess based on market prices in favor of the general model with price distortions. Farmers' useful thing/valuable supply gift and 
 education influence their response to the market restrictions, this way change  their performance in terms of (wasting very little while working or producing something). The guessed (wasting very little while working or producing something) 
 index ranges from 6% to 93% with a sample average of 62%. Families' educational level, family size and per person net income are 
 positively related to production (wasting very little while working or producing something). Families living in mountain areas or with family members employed by the government or 
 state businesses are (compared to other things) inefficient. Reducing market helping action, allowing right of use of farm land to be moved (from one place to another) among 
 families, encouraging traveling of excess farm labor, and (helping increase/showing in a good way) farmers' education will improve (away from cities) families' (wasting very little while working or producing something) in 
 farming-based production. 
 
 1. Introduction 
 The (wasting very little while working or producing something) gains from improving useful thing/valuable supply 
 portion resulting from money-based changes in 
 China's farming have been dramatic. Fan ( 1991) 
 guessed that about 63% of the working well change 
 (at an average of 2.13% per year, 1965-1985) is 
 (named after/discovered by/caused by) improvement in (wasting very little while working or producing something). Lin ( 1992) 
 found that the working well change resulting from 
 different changes made up 42.23% of the output growth 
 during 1978-1984, and no increasing (popular thing/general way things are going) in (related to computers and science) change was detected. Central to this change towards free markets in Chinese agricul-

 ture is the behavior of the individual (away from cities) household. 
 With the (away from cities) Household Responsibility System 
 (RHRS) the basic production unit was moved/changed from 
 collectivized farms to the (away from cities) families. Other 
 changes allowed for the sale of valuable things to private parties and the free flow of extra (away from cities) labor 
 to local businesses and city-based  areas. The farming-based 
 part/area responded to these changes with increased 
 production for most major valuable things due to working well gains. With the full (putting into) use of 
 RHRS nationwide in 1983-1984, the question of 
 whether production (wasting very little while working or producing something) is still a great (possibility of/possible happening of)  working well growth remains unanswered. 
 Although the money-based changes have greatly reduced 
 direct control by government over production, different interferences in farming-based markets still distort

 farmers' production decisions. The relationships between (wasting very little while working or producing something) and market indicators and household (features/ qualities/ traits) have not been well studied in 
 this unfolding process of farming-based reform. A better understanding of these relationships should aid 
 policymakers in creating improved (wasting very little while working or producing something)-improving policies and in judging the effectiveness of past 
 changes. These relationships are also of interest to 
 policymakers in other nations where government 
 plays a big part in traditional farming. 
 Production (wasting very little while working or producing something) is usually carefully studied by separately examining its two parts/pieces: technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) and allocative (wasting very little while working or producing something). Recent developments reported in the books combine both measures into one system. This approach enables more 
 (producing a lot with very little waste) guesses to be gotten by (at the same time) 
 guessing the system (e.g. Kumbhakar, 1989; Kalirajan, 1990). However, previous research (after- 1978) 
 on Chinese farming-based working well focused on total 
 factor working well, while technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) and 
 allocative (wasting very little while working or producing something) were rarely examined 1- 
 Although (random/including random data points) production edge of something/unexplored area functions 
 are most commonly used in studying production 
 (wasting very little while working or producing something), Yotopoulos and others argued that a production function approach may not be appropriate 
 when guessing the production (wasting very little while working or producing something) of individual farms because they may face different prices and 
 have different factor gifts (Ali and Flinn, 
 1989). An attempt to incorporate firm level prices 
 and input use led to (make money/get something good) function creation. The 
 early development of profit function models did not 
 provide a number-based measure of firm clearly stated/particular (wasting very little while working or producing something) (Aigner et al., 1977). Ali and Flinn (1989) 
 directly guessed farm-clearly stated/particular (wasting very little while working or producing something) from a 
 random coefficient profit edge of something/unexplored area function using 
 market prices. In general, the use of standard dual 
 representations of the production structure needs/demands 
 the similar maintained guesses of cost 
 minimization or profit (biggest increase/best possible extent), subject to parametric market prices. So, in the case of controlled 
 businesses or (not totally pure/not totally correct) markets, as in China, these 
 guesses may be invalid. 
 A generalized profit function (behavioral (money made/good thing received) 
 1 Most after- 1978 working well studies focused on the effects of 
 institutional changes on output and working well growth (e.g. Lin, 
 1992; McMillan et al. (1989); Fleisher and Liu ( 1992). Only Ma 
 et al. (1989) examined (wasting very little while working or producing something) at farm level. 
 
 function) approach which incorporates market distortions resulting from (not totally pure/not totally correct) market conditions has 
 been developed in the books. Kumbhakar and 
 Bhattacharyya (1992) developed a behavioral profit 
 function to test the appropriateness of a neoclassical 
 profit function and the effect of education and farm 
 size on allocative performance. Their model, however, does not provide a number-based measure of profit 
 (wasting very little while working or producing something) for each farm. A more recent study done by Ali et al. (1994) employed both (random/including random data points) 
 edge of something/unexplored area and behavioral (money made/good thing received) functions separately in 
 a study of Pakistan farming. The rejection of 
 profit (biggest increase/best possible extent) based on watched/followed market prices 
 from the behavioral profit function, however, points to/shows that their (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area function, which 
 was specified by using watched/followed market prices, is 
 subject to misspecification. (related to/looking at/thinking about) after- 1978 
 Chinese farming-based (wasting very little while working or producing something) studies, very few employed the dual approach and none incorporated 
 market distortions. 
 The goal of this study is to carefully study production (wasting very little while working or producing something) of farm families facing different 
 market restrictions in Chinese farming. An guess process that incorporates market distortions but 
 keeps/holds the advantages of (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area properties in (wasting very little while working or producing something) analysis is developed in this study. 
 China's (away from cities) Household Survey data for 1991 are 
 used for the scientific analysis. First&#126; a behavioral 
 profit function is used to get farmers' shadow 
 prices. Then a (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area profit function, 
 using the shadow prices received/got from the behavioral profit function, is guessed and the (wasting very little while working or producing something) 
 index is received/made from and related to farm families' 
 information about people to identify the factors that 
 affect farm families' (wasting very little while working or producing something). 
 
 2. Modeling market distortions and the (random/including random data points) 
 profit edge of something/unexplored area 
 Given the existence of binding restrictions on 
 decision-making, as showed by some studies 
 (e.g. Toda, 1976; Atkinson and Halvorsen, 1980; 
 Kumbhakar and Bhattacharyya, 1992), the producers' decision is often made with respect to shadow 
 prices-i.e. the prices that they actually paid and 
 received, rather than watched/followed market prices. The 
 separation between the shadow and watched/followed market 
 prices can be understood/explained as the result of different 
 
 J. Wang et al.j Farming-based Money flow 15 (/996) 17-28 
 
 market restrictions, as well as allocative inefficiency 
 caused by errors in optimization. One commonly 
 used measure of the separation between the two 
 prices, based on Lau and Yotopoulos (1971), is to 
 define a relationship between the (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy)ized shadow 
 price, p' ( w' for input), and the (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy)ized market 
 price, p ( w), as P} = ej pj and w: = ei W;, where ej 
 and ei are (non-negative) price (wasting very little while working or producing something) limits/guidelines. The subscripts j and i index outputs and inputs, 
 (match up each pair of items in order). If there are no bending market restrictions then () equals togetherness. So, a farmer is allocatively (producing a lot with very little waste) with respect to watched/followed market prices 
 only when the watched/followed market prices reflect the 
 farmer's opportunity cost of inputs and outputs 2 - 
 Based on the above settings, a profit-making the most of 
 farmer's behavior can be expressed by specifying a 
 behavioral (money made/good thing received) (shadow (money made/good thing received)) function, 1T * = 
 7T( p', w', z) in the translog form, (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy)ized by one 
 input price, as: 
 n-1 
 
 ln7T 
 
 a0 
 
 * = 
 
 + [_(, a 1 In( e1 pJ + [_(, /3; 
 
 In( 8;w;) 
 
 j 
 
 19 
 
 where j,k = 1,2 ... M are number of outputs, i,l = 
 1,2 ... N-1 are number of inputs, q,h= 1,2 ... Q 
 are number of fixed inputs, (e1p) and (e;w) are 
 (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy)ized shadow prices of outputs and inputs (match up each pair of items in order), and z" are amounts of fixed inputs. 
 Eq. (1) cannot be directly guessed to measure 
 the profit (wasting very little while working or producing something) 3 because the shadow prices are 
 unseen, and so is the shadow (money made/good thing received) 1T *. In an 
 scientific sample, however, whether or not a good 
 guess of the shadow (money made/good thing received) ( 1T * ) exists depends on the (detailed description of exactly what is required) of 1T *, as well as on 
 survey design and the data collection (machine/method/way). 
 Given the shadow (money made/good thing received) 1T * defined in Eq. (1), 
 directly reported net returns that a farmer actually 
 received/got from his operation under the market distortion can be a close guess of 1T * in the data 
 set to be used in this study 4 - To make guess of 
 Eq. (1) possible, we need information on () for the 
 shadow prices. The following change serves 
 the purpose. 
 The shadow (money made/good thing received) 1T *, (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy)ized by enwn, can 
 be expressed as:

 (in almost the same way), a non-twisted/partially untrue/lied about (money made/good thing received), 1T a (actual (money made/good thing received),

 2 Allocative (wasting very little while working or producing something) is tested from the producer's point of 
 view of profit (biggest increase/best possible extent). It does not necessarily reflect social 
 costs and therefore is not necessarily (producing a lot with very little waste) in the sense of 
 social cost-benefit test. It is also to be noted that the 
 effects of errors in optimization on allocative (wasting very little while working or producing something) cannot be 
 separated from market distortions in this setting. So, the price 
 (wasting very little while working or producing something) limit/guideline e may contain a combined source of price 
 inefficiency. 
 
 3 This study combines the ideas of technical and allocative 
 (wasting very little while working or producing something) in the profit relationship. Within a profit function 
 big picture, profit (wasting very little while working or producing something) is defined as the ability of a farm to 
 (accomplish or gain with effort) the highest possible (money made/good thing received) given the prices and level of 
 fixed factors. Since there were very limited market other choices for 
 farmers in China to market their products in 1991, much of their 
 returns was figured out by/decided by production decisions rather than market 
 decisions. So, the profit (wasting very little while working or producing something) actually measures farmers' 
 production (wasting very little while working or producing something). 
 4 Further discussion will be given in the data section. 
 5 The words/word choices of 'actual profit' used for 'ITa= '(British pounds)p y 1 1 
 L.w;x; in the books is sneaky and false. 7Ta states what a farmer's 
 (money made/good thing received) would be if there were no market distortions or what the 
 (money made/good thing received) would be if the market prices were used for profit calculation based on the farmer's choices of y1 and x; made under 
 market distortions. Since the market prices are not necessarily 
 equal to the prices that the farmer actually paid and received, 1ra 
 is not the actual (money made/good thing received) that the farmer truly received/got from his 
 practice in the twisted/partially untrue/lied about market.

 can be written as:

 Substituting xn from Eq. (3) into Eq. (2) and 
 applying Hotelling's lemma to the non-twisted/partially untrue/lied about 
 profit function 7T a to get profit shares ( sj, sn, 
 yields the following relationship between 7T * and

 Further, by specifying a translog function for the 
 non-twisted/partially untrue/lied about profit function ( 7T a), and taking logarithm on 7T * , we get the shadow (money made/good thing received) expressed 
 as the non-twisted/partially untrue/lied about profit function in translog form

 where farmers' actually paid (received) prices are 
 different from watched/followed market prices and the farmers directly reported their actual (money made/good thing received) or total money/money income and total costs based on the prices they actually 
 paid (received). In such a case, 7T * , the (money made/good thing received) that 
 farmers actually received/got in a twisted/partially untrue/lied about market, contains more information than 7T a does 6 - 
 Although the shadow prices are eliminated, Eq. 
 (6) still contains the unseen price (wasting very little while working or producing something) 
 limits/guidelines, oj and 0;, which are hidden/covered up (numbers that change/things that change). 
 They are assumed to be farm-specific in order to 
 reflect an individual farmer's response to market 
 distortions. Since one of our goals is to examine 
 whether education and relative useful thing/valuable supply gift 
 have any influence on price response to market 
 distortions, we model 0 as follows for each input 
 and output price: 
 
 Further, a profit shifter can be formed to capture 
 technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) across families. Following 
 Kumbhakar and Bhattacharyya ( 1992), technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) is modeled as a function of farm size, FS, and 
 the household labor's highest educational level

 It is worth noting that we specify 7T

 function of 7T a and price (wasting very little while working or producing something) limits/guidelines, 0, 
 rather than 7T a as a function of 7T * and 0 in the 
 books. This (detailed description of exactly what is required) is designed for the case 
 
 6 In cases where 7r - is unknown, a more generalized other choice which uses fitted 7T * has been developed by Wang, Wailes 
 and Cramer. 
 7 A early/incomplete (related to studying numbers) analysis shows that the labor /land 
 ratio is related to a few farm (typical and expected) (numbers that change/things that change), such 
 as farm size, off-farm employment, machinery use, because these 
 (numbers that change/things that change) are mainly affected by the lack of land and (oversupply/large quantity) of labor in China's farming.

 guessed to get the guessed price (wasting very little while working or producing something) 
 limit/guideline (} and the effects of FS and EL on technical (wasting very little while working or producing something). 
 The second step is to construct a (random/including random data points) 
 shadow-profit edge of something/unexplored area function. The guessed (} 
 values from the first step are used to get the 
 shadow prices. The shadow prices are used directly 
 as arguments in the translog profit function (Eq. (1)) 
 with an error term, g;, which is assumed to behave in 
 a manner agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with the (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area idea: 
 
 (IO) 
 It is assumed that v;, reflecting random disturbance, is (usually/ in a common and regular way) distributed, while u; is a one-sided 
 disturbance term used to represent the inefficiency 
 measures. We assume u; has a half-(usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) nonnegative distribution, [N(O,a})l. The population average (wasting very little while working or producing something) is given as: 
 
 (II) 
 where F is the standard (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) distribution function. 
 Following Jondrow et al. ( I982), the farm-specific 
 guesses of inefficiency, u;, for each (instance of watching, noticing, or making a statement) are 
 came/coming from the (may or may not happen, depending on something) distribution of u;, given 
 
 gi = V; + U;:

 =

 ( I2) 
 
 where u} and u} are the variance of V; and u;. 
 A= uufuv, u 2 = u} + u}, and f and F are the 
 standard (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) density and total distribution 
 functions, (match up each pair of items in order), guessed at g; A/ u. 
 Finally, the farm-specific (wasting very little while working or producing something) index 
 (exp[- u;']) can be built using the results 
 from Eq. ( I2). Since the inefficiency term u; is 
 cut short at zero by the idea (you think is true) of the edge of something/unexplored area 
 function, a cut short moving backward of a semi-log (wasting very little while working or producing something) index against household information about people provides the right/the proper rotting of the 
 (wasting very little while working or producing something) index. 
 
 3. Data and scientific guess 
 The data used for this scientific application are a 
 subsample of China's National (away from cities) Household Sur- 
 
 21 
 
 vey for 1991. This survey, started in 1955 by the 
 General Organization of (away from cities) Socio-Money-based Survey of the State (related to studying numbers) Bureau (SSB), changed 
 from the Chinese (away from cities) Household Expense Survey started in the late 1970s. Since 1984, a multistage sampling procedure combined with period of time (or space) 
 sampling at the lowest level has been used in the 
 survey design to secure/make sure of the random nature of the 
 sample and to (make small) sampling errors (State (related to studying numbers) Bureau of China, 1993). The survey records 
 all major production and consumption activities of 
 70 000 participating families during the survey 
 year. 
 Farmers' production activities were influenced by 
 different market distortions which mainly came from 
 government helping action. By I991, for example, the 
 state contract (instance of buying something for money) for a specified amount of 
 output at a price fixed below the market price and 
 the purchase of amounts that went beyond the contract amounts under the (what people commonly call a/not really a) 'negotiated 
 prices', which in most cases were also lower than 
 market prices, were major government influences in 
 farming-based output markets. In the farming-based input 
 markets, government-owned businesses delivered 
 farm inputs, such as chemical (material that makes plants grow better)s and diesel 
 fuel, at low fixed prices to producers for many years. 
 To help purchase, the government has often 
 used input payments to cause cooperation from 
 farmers 8 . 
 Other sociopolitical and institutional restrictions 
 faced by Chinese farmers also cause market distortions. For instance, there are always shortages in 
 major material input supplies such as (material that makes plants grow better). Some 
 farmers may be able to get an (good) enough supply of 
 (material that makes plants grow better) at the state distribution prices because of 
 their personal relationship with state (services businesses/government units), while 
 others may have to pay a 'shortage premium'. Village leaders andjor families with non-farm-workers 
 may have special privileges, such as access to credit 
 or receive cash payment for their sales to the state 
 
 8 Since 1993, China has brought changes to its input supply 
 system. Now, a wide variety of businesses owned together 
 and by the government are delivering inputs to (away from cities) area (US 
 Department of Farming, 1993). However, the state planning 
 system still forces (numbers-based) restrictions on farmers' access to 
 paid-for inputs (You  and Rozelle, 1994). 
 
 22

 buying organizations, while others are forced to 
 accept the state's use of (written promises to pay) (IOU) 
 instead of cash for their products 9 . In many cases, 
 special fees have been charged and collected by local governments 
 on farmers that are related to purchase and input 
 supply. In these situations, the actual prices received 
 and paid by farmers are different from what has been 
 watched/followed in the market because of the existence of 
 these non-price restrictions. 
 The subsample used in this study is randomly 
 selected from the national sample 10 - For the analysis 
 in this study, 1786 (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) were used. The 
 survey contains no price (numbers that change/things that change). All farm-specific 
 price (numbers that change/things that change) in the analysis are unit values, credited by using amount and expense or money/money income 
 (numbers that change/things that change) 11 - When credited values are not possible 
 (i.e. the household did not produce or buy a 
 clearly stated/particular output or input), the missing prices are set 
 according to the average of the area of control/area of land where the 
 household is located. Price indices for outputs and 
 (number or thing that changes) inputs are built using the Divisia 
 index: 
 
 (13) 
 where lnpf is the price index for the jth group 
 for the hth household, r;&#126; is the share of the ith item 
 in the jth group for the hth household, lnpt is 
 the price of the ith item in the jth group for the 
 hth household, r;j and lnp;j are the averages of the 
 shares and prices for all families in the sample, 
 (match up each pair of items in order). The base for these indices is the aver- 
 
 9 Well into the 1991 harvest season, some areas had, according to reports, not completely paid off IOUs on the 1990 harvest (US 
 Department of Farming, 1991 ). 
 10 A few changes were made on the experimental design of the 
 survey samples between 1950 and 1990. This may raise the 
 question of (state of always working or appearing the same way) in a time series study, but it should not 
 affect our use of a thin slice sample. Since the subsample we 
 used in the analysis is randomly selected from the survey, the 
 not enough randomness and lack of sampling weight should not 
 limit our (related to studying numbers) reference drawn from the random sample. 
 11 The survey needs/demands participating families to record only 
 immediate money/money income and cost without any connected benefits or 
 expenses for each sale or (instance of buying something for money). For example, if a farmer 
 made a trip to buy some (material that makes plants grow better), his travel and (material that makes plants grow better) transportation expenses would not be recorded under 'fertilizer expense' but under 'other expense'. 
 
 age of the sample. Two output prices of crops and 
 animals, two changeable input prices of chemical (material that makes plants grow better) and other (bought something for money) materials (including fuel, 
 seeds, plastic sheets, bug-killers, etc.), and three fixed 
 inputs of labor (no hired labor was recorded), land 
 and capital are grouped from different of outputs 
 and inputs recorded in the data set. Through the 
 above grouping, all families in the sample 
 produced the two outputs and used the two changeable 
 inputs. 
 For the non-land capital inputs, it is assumed that 
 the service flow from the stock of capital is (fair in amount, related to/properly sized, related to) the stock. As a result, a certain percentage of the stock value can be used as a substitute for the 
 service flow. Land is taken as the total area of 
 (helped to grow) land including both contracted areas and 
 private plots. The labor (number or thing that changes) is defined as the 
 total number of male-equals working at farming-based production. These fixed inputs are expressed in 
 index form with the average of the sample used as a 
 base. For the (numbers that change/things that change) FS and EL in Eq. (9), four 
 dummy (numbers that change/things that change)-SF (small farm), LF (large farm), 
 LE (low education) and HE (high education)-are 
 built to distinguish relative farm size and the 
 highest education level household labor (accomplished or gained). 
 The selected household information about people are 
 family size, per person net income, whether the 
 household has any family member operating as a 
 village leader or employed by government or state 
 businesses, and the household's (land-area-based/location) 
 location 12 - 
 (money made/good thing received) is defined as total money/money income (including selfconsumption and storage) minus total (number or thing that changes) costs. 
 The data contain families' total money/money income and total 
 (number or thing that changes) costs which are directly reported by the 
 survey families for their operations of crops and 
 animals. The data also record the families' pro- 
 
 12 The sample mean for FS is 12.8 mu (I mu equals 1/15 ha). 
 The small (large) farms are the families that operate less 
 (great) than 1.3 (100) mu of land. Lower education level is 
 assigned if EL is first (or most important) school or less. College level is 
 assigned if EL is high school or college graduate. For the dummy 
 (numbers that change/things that change) used in the (wasting very little while working or producing something) rotting moving backward, small 
 (large) families are the families having less (more) than three 
 (six) people. High (low) income families are assigned if the 
 household's per person net income is greater (less) than 1000 (500) 
 yuan. They are randomly decided/figured out.

 duction and sales of each valuable thing and input 
 factors used for the operations. A means test shows 
 that the means of the farmers' directly reported 
 money/money income and costs are very different from 
 those figured out/calculated using market prices. The differences 
 may be caused by the existence of market restrictions and the prices used in valuing products of 
 
 23 
 
 inventory and direct household consumption 13 - To 
 be agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with the argument that 7T * contains 
 more information than 7T" does, the money/money income and 
 costs directly reported by the farmer are used to 
 create the shadow (money made/good thing received) for 7T *. 
 In the first-step guess, Eq. (6) is guessed 
 using sj and sf came/coming from the non-twisted/partially untrue/lied about 
 translog profit function On1r") to get guesses for 
 the price (wasting very little while working or producing something) limits/guidelines (e). It is necessary to 
 substitute the price (wasting very little while working or producing something) limits/guidelines 8 in Eq. 
 (7) with the (related to a large area) (stopping or interfering with something) in Eq. (8) and to add 
 Eq. (9) to measure the technical (wasting very little while working or producing something). The 
 model is guessed using a non-linear repeating/repetitive (appearing to be) unrelated moving backward (ITSUR) way of doing things with 
 matching and evenness conditions forced. 
 Kmenta and Gilbert (1968) have shown that the 
 limits/guidelines guessed from the ITSUR procedure 
 come together to maximum chance guesses. The guesses are reported in Table 1. In the second-step 
 guess, the behavioral (shadow-price) profit function (Eq. (1)) with all price (numbers that change/things that change) (changed to make better/changed to fit new conditions) by the 
 guessed 8, along with the error term gi = v; + u;, 
 is guessed by the (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area way of doing things 
 (LIMDEP, Green, 1992) to get the shadow-profit 
 edge of something/unexplored area. The guessed coefficients are given in Table 
 2

 4. Scientific results 
 With the guess of Eq. (6), the guess of 
 profit (biggest increase/best possible extent) based on market prices is tested 
 by forcing the limit/guideline restrictions of eb = 1 for 
 all b. The value of the test statistic is 19. Compared 
 
 13 The enumerators in each county construct the local prices 
 used to test products of (amount or quantity of items stored now) and own-consumption 
 according to an average market price for each valuable thing at its 
 peak season. Since the proportions of (amount or quantity of items stored now) and own-consumption differs/changes across families (national average of own-consumption for grain products was 49.4% in 1990), the effect of 
 these built prices on (money made/good thing received) will not be reflected by the 
 county dummy (numbers that change/things that change). 
 14 To save space, the guesses of the county dummy (numbers that change/things that change) 
 are not reported in the tables. Based on the !-statistics, 56% of the 
 guesses are very different from zero at the 0.05 level of 
 importance for the behavioral guess and 58% for the edge of something/unexplored area 
 guess.

 with the critical value 16.92 of x 2 with 9 degrees of 
 freedom at the 0.05 level of importance, the restricted market price model is rejected in favor of the 
 model with market distortion and allocative inefficiency. The test result points to/shows that profit (biggest increase/best possible extent) based on market prices may be inappropriate. 
 So, the shadow profit model that includes 
 market distortions is more good for this data 
 sample 15 - 
 The guessed farm-specific price (wasting very little while working or producing something) limits/guidelines for crops (0 1), animals (0 2 ), and chemical 
 (material that makes plants grow better) (0) are figured out/calculated for all (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements). On 
 average, 0 1 takes the value of 0.84 with 99% of the 
 individual values less than one. The mean for 0 2 is 
 found to be 0.86 and 96% of the individual values 
 were less than one, pointing to/showing that the 'prices' actually received by farmers for their products of crops 
 and animals are less than the watched/followed market price 
 because of the existence of market distortions. On 
 the input side, the mean of the farmers' shadow price 
 of using chemical (material that makes plants grow better) is greater than the watched/followed market price based on a mean for the guessed Oc of 1.16 with 53% of the individual values 
 greater than one. 
 The guessed values of 0 1,02 and Oc show that a 
 farm household's educational level and laborjland 
 ratio, as two first (or most important) (numbers that change/things that change) of useful thing/valuable supply gift, influence its allocative performance. The guessed values of 0 1, and Oc approach togetherness as the 
 level of education increases, holding the labor/land 
 ratio at the mean level (the guessed coefficient on 
 education for 0 2 is not significant). This result points to/shows that the level of education improves allocative 
 (wasting very little while working or producing something). The guesses of families' laborjland 
 ratio show a mixed effect on portion performance. For example, a higher ratio raises the distortion effect on crops (in bringing 0 1 below togetherness); on 
 the other hand, it reduces the distortion effect on 
 animals production and (material that makes plants grow better) use (in bringing 
 the 0 2 and Oc close to togetherness) when holding education 
 at the mean level. These results may reflect the fact 
 that small-sized crop farms bear much output price 
 
 15 Lopez (1985) shows that scientifically the most flexible functional forms do not make happy the properties of monotonicity and 
 curviness around the world. We did not test these properties for our profit 
 function.

 distortion while some animals producers may take 
 advantage of (focusing on doing one thing very well) in animals production. 
 The guessed coefficients of technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) 
 (numbers that change/things that change) show that the larger farms tend to be 
 (compared to other things) technically (producing a lot with very little waste) ( T 1L = 0.83) and the 
 small farms are technically inefficient ( T 1s = - 0.57). 
 Based on the guessed price (wasting very little while working or producing something) limits/guidelines (0) from the first step, a maximum-chance 
 guess of the shadow profit edge of something/unexplored area (Eq. (1) with 
 Eq. (10)) is received/got and a profit (wasting very little while working or producing something) index is 
 received/made from. The mean of the profit (wasting very little while working or producing something) measure, 
 E(e-u), is 0.62. This result hints that an average 
 of 38% of (money made/good thing received) is lost due to inefficiency. The 
 frequency distribution of the individual household's 
 
 J. Wang et al.j Farming-based Money flow 15 ( 1996) 17-28 
 
 (wasting very little while working or producing something) index (Table 3) shows that there is a wide 
 difference/different version in the level of (wasting very little while working or producing something) among families. The (wasting very little while working or producing something) guesses range from 0.06 to 
 0.93. About 11.8% of families are in an (wasting very little while working or producing something) range below 0.50. The standard errors of the 
 inefficiency factor (a) add/give 91% to that of the 
 total error term ( u ), which points to/shows that the inefficiency term rules the total error term. These 
 results suggest that a lot of (money made/good thing received) 
 can be gotten by improving technical and allocative (wasting very little while working or producing something) in Chinese farming. 
 The received/made from farm-specific (wasting very little while working or producing something) index helps rotting of the (wasting very little while working or producing something) performance at 
 the farm level. Such analyses allow us to identify the 
 factors that influence farmers' (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste). Table 4 
 contains the guesses of the cut short moving backward of 
 the (wasting very little while working or producing something) rotting that explains relationship between a household's profit (wasting very little while working or producing something) and its 
 information about people. The results show that a 
 household's educational level, family size and per 
 capita net income are positively related to its (wasting very little while working or producing something). Families in mountain areas and families with family members employed by the government or state businesses are (compared to other things) inefficient 16 - 
 The guessed coefficients also show (compared to other things) large 
 importance of net per person income (0.40 for high 
 net income and - 0.17 for low net income) and 
 household size (0.14 for a large family and - 0.25 
 for a small family) to (wasting very little while working or producing something) performance. These 
 results show the existence of (processes of people making, selling, and buying things) of 
 size in China's household farming system. The positive coefficients for a more highly educated household and village leader, although of (compared to other things) small 
 importance, may reflect these families' privileges 
 on (using/getting to) technology and market information. 
 To (check for truth/prove true) how close a farmer's shadow (money made/good thing received) can 
 be came close to by his directly reported (money made/good thing received) in the 
 
 16 Most off-farm workers, especially those employed by the 
 government and state businesses, are married males. Their wives 
 and children have remained in (away from cities) families. Farm-land was 
 distributed basically according to the number of people in each 
 household; therefore, relative lack of labor and experience causes 
 lower (wasting very little while working or producing something). In general, this kind of household has less 
 (reward or reason for doing something) to improve its performance because its well-being depends on off-farm income.

 survey, and to test the effect of this guess on the farmer's (wasting very little while working or producing something) analysis, we (did/done/completed) a sensitivity analysis by using (described the future) 
 shadow (money made/good thing received) from a (described the future) shadow-profit model 
 suggested in Wang et al. (1996). The distribution of 
 the guessed (wasting very little while working or producing something) index and its rotting 
 from the (described the future) profit model are very close to that 
 came/coming from the model developed in this study. Both 
 models yield the same mean of the profit (wasting very little while working or producing something), 
 0.62. The (described the future) profit model guesses a (a) little 
 larger proportion of families (12.5% compared to 
 11.8%) with an (wasting very little while working or producing something) level below 0.50. The 
 results of the (wasting very little while working or producing something) rotting (Table 4) 
 show that the guesses from two different models 
 are similar. The sign of the guesses between 
 the two models is the same for each (number or thing that changes). The 
 importance of the guesses, as well as level of 
 statistic importance, are almost the same  between the two 
 groups of guesses. This result points to/shows that farmer 
 directly reported (money made/good thing received) can be used as a substitute of 
 shadow (money made/good thing received) in shadow-profit analysis to simplify 
 the guess procedures. It also points to/shows the strength of guesses received/got from the model specified in this study. 
 The guessed limits/guidelines of the county dummy 
 (numbers that change/things that change) show that there are a big differences

 dummy (numbers that change/things that change) explain 20.45% of total sample 
 differences/different versions in this model and 25.56% in the (described the future)

 effects, however, is beyond the extent of/the range of this study. 
 
 5. Summary and policy effects/results/suggestions 
 This study uses a profit function approach which 
 combines technical and allocative (wasting very little while working or producing something) in the 
 profit relationship to carefully study farm families' production (wasting very little while working or producing something) in China. To deal with the/to speak to the  existence 
 of different market distortions in Chinese farming, 
 we adopt a idea  of shadow-price profit edge of something/unexplored area in 
 this study. Measurement and rotting of the 
 families' production (wasting very little while working or producing something) are received/got by 
 guessing the shadow profit edge of something/unexplored area function, which 
 incorporates price distortions resulting from (not totally pure/not totally correct) markets, (how money affects people's lives) and institutional restrictions. Scientific results using 1991 China's (away from cities) 
 Household Survey data point to/show that a profit-making the most of farm's decision on outputs and inputs is 
 based on their shadow prices rather than watched/followed 
 
 market prices. It is also found that there is a significant difference/different version in production (wasting very little while working or producing something) among farm 
 families in China. Guessed production (wasting very little while working or producing something), measured by the profit (wasting very little while working or producing something) index, range 
 from 6% to 93%, with 11.8% percent of the farm 
 families' (wasting very little while working or producing something) levels being lower than 50%. 
 The mean of the profit (wasting very little while working or producing something) is 62%, which is 
 close to the 69% for the coastal area and the 48% 
 for the central area found in Wu (1995) using 
 1985-1991 (related to a local area) data. These results suggest a 
 great scope for improvement in production (wasting very little while working or producing something). 
 The profit (wasting very little while working or producing something) is significantly explained by 
 the production-related (features/ qualities/ traits) and farm management practices. Especially, farmers' education, 
 farm size and per person net income are important 
 (numbers that change/things that change) to raise profit (wasting very little while working or producing something). The factors affecting (money made/good thing received) (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) negatively are small family 
 size (less than three people) and low per person net 
 income. Families living in mountain areas and 
 families with family members employed in the 
 government or state businesses are profit inefficient. 
 Given the existing government of input and output 
 prices in China's farming, one end/end result that can 
 be drawn from this study is that produces of price 
 distortions must be thought about/believed in farm behavior studies. This model has completely/in a hinting way (made a part of you) these distortions through the shadow prices. Rejection of the 
 market price model points to/shows that opportunity costs 
 of useful things/valuable supplies are not reflected by the watched/followed market 
 prices when there are binding external restrictions 
 and allocative inefficiency. So, scientific studies 
 that use (money made/good thing received) (cost) function with watched/followed market 
 prices as the opportunity costs of useful things/valuable supplies may give 
 inappropriate results. 
 The second end/end result drawn from the study is 
 that a great (possible power or ability within/possibility of)  (wasting very little while working or producing something) gain can be gotten by reducing market distortions in China's 
 farming. The (away from cities) Household Responsibility System, as the first phase of the (away from cities) money-based changes 
 that focused on the production operating (machine/method/way), 
 has (in a big way) improved farm families' (wasting very little while working or producing something). Although (away from cities) input and output market changes have been done since 1985, different 
 market restrictions still remain effective in preventing farm families' best useful thing/valuable supply portion. 
 The a big differences between the market prices 
 and farmer's opportunity costs, found in this study, 
 
 J. Wang et al.j Farming-based Money flow 15 (1996) 17-28 
 
 hints that farm families' allocative (wasting very little while working or producing something) is 
 influenced by the market distortions. 
 The study also finds (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) that (processes of people making, selling, and buying things) of 
 scale exist in China's household farming system. 
 Both technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) and allocative (wasting very little while working or producing something) 
 are positively related to operational size, which is 
 also partly figured out by/decided by family size and per person 
 net income. 
 The above findings have important policy effects/results/suggestions. All previous studies show/tell about that a big 
 improvement in China's farming-based production (wasting very little while working or producing something) has happened from the institutional changes 
 made from 1978 to 1984. With the full (putting into) use of the household responsibility system nationwide in 1983-1984, slow growth in crop production 
 and working well has shifted the focus of farming-based 
 development towards technical change. This study 
 points to/shows that big working well gains can be 
 received/got by continuously improving farm families' production (wasting very little while working or producing something). Both technical and a)locative (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) can be improved by eliminating 
 market distortions that mess up the function of price 
 signal and cause allocative inefficiency. Especially, 
 removing the government's monopsonistic power and 
 (related to managing and running a company or organization) forces on major farming-based product 
 purchase and (instance of buying something for money) of quota responsibilities in the 
 output market should allow market prices to reflect 
 the opportunity costs of the products. In the input 
 market, (helping increase/showing in a good way) the supply of not enough material 
 inputs, such as chemical (material that makes plants grow better) and fuel, rather 
 than restricting and price payments, could eliminate 
 the 'shortage premium' paid by some farmers and 
 over-use of the inputs by others. A more liberalized 
 market enables production ((money made/good thing received)) to return to its 
 edge of something/unexplored area from the interior and shifts the edge of something/unexplored area upward. The reason for this shift is that the (possible power or ability within/possibility of) 
 the money-based changes and modem technologies appears to be underestimated because the best practice 
 farms, which are basis for guessing the (possible greatness or power), 
 would probably also be held back by (how money affects people's lives) and institutional factors. 
 The study also hints that potential (wasting very little while working or producing something) 
 gain can be (accomplished or gained) by increasing a household's 
 operating scale. Especially, allowing a (compared to other things) 
 (when there's not nearly enough of an important or valuable thing), land, to be moved (from one place to another) to families 
 with a high labor /land ratio should increase the 
 production (wasting very little while working or producing something) of these crop farms. As a result, improved useful thing/valuable supply use needs/demands development

 of a land rental market or a well-conducted land use 
 right move (from one place to another) (machine/method/way) as a complement to the 
 land contract system 17 - The market can pick winners 
 and losers and set apart land to those who can use 
 it (in a way that produces a lot with very little waste). 
 Clearly, a farm household's production (wasting very little while working or producing something) 
 is affected by its management practices and the 
 farm's production-related (features/ qualities/ traits), which in 
 tum are influenced by (how money affects people's lives) conditions. For 
 instance, a farmer's management ability is influenced by school availability and cost of education. It 
 is this way important for China's farming-based development to have an institutional (surrounding conditions) that helps the farmers' (how easy something is to get to, use, or understand) to education, and 
 provides a (how money affects people's lives) (surrounding conditions) that encourages market exchange in land and labor.

 17 Under the original land contract system, land is equally 
 distributed to families on a per person basis. Now, there is 
 not a (clearly visible/clearly understood) land market in China. Sales of farmland are 
 very rare. However, the right of land use can be moved (from one place to another) in 
 accordance with the law that was approved on l 2 April 1988, and 
 farmers have found a way to move (from one place to another) land use rights through 
 village (groups that decide or promote things) and township government that manage the 
 land contract system (Zhang and Makeham, 1992; US Department 
 of Farming, l 993).
