 Abstract 
 This paper thinks about/believes the hit/effect of 'food scares', mostly concerns relating to BSE, on UK beef prices at retail, 
 wholesale and producer levels over the 1990s. Admitting/recognizing/responding to the co-movement that exists between prices in the meat 
 marketing chain, we use a co-integrating (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built), the results of which show the importance of (being talked about a lot on TV, online, etc.) (related to/looking at/thinking about) the 
 safety of food in the transmission of beef prices in the UK. The 'food (being talked about a lot on TV, online, etc.)' index that we use has a marked negative 
 hit/effect on the prices at all levels, a result that is agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with the effect of an inward move/change in the demand function. More than that, 
 the extent of price decline differs/changes between the marketing stages involving that the price spreads rise in response to an increase 
 in the (negative) (being talked about a lot on TV, online, etc.) about food safety. While not a formal test of market power, these (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) are agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with 
 recent possible results (showing or proving) that market power worsens price changes in the upstream parts/areas for a given change 
 in the retail demand function. The hint/result/effect of these different price changes is that the food safety concerns also cause the 
 marketing margins between the stages to widen. The UK's Competition Commission has (not very long ago) (examined closely) the (very mean, unfair treatment) of 
 market power in the food part/area, motivated mostly by this clearly stated/particular issue.Â© 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

 1. Introduction 
 
 Over the last few years, issues relating to food safety have 
 risen to the top of the political purpose in many countries, especially in Europe and North America. Much 
 of this (list of things to deal with/desire to reach a goal) has related to the increased knowledge 
 over health, changing dietary patterns and the differences in standards between the countries that lie at the 
 heart of trade arguments. However, maybe the most famous feature of the increased public reaction to food 
 safety is the issue of 'food scares'. This is especially

 the case in Europe, and is showed by the outbreak 
 of BSE in the UK, which according to guesses (DTZ 
 Pieda Consulting, 1998) saw beef consumption fall 
 (for a short time) by 40%, not only in the UK itself, but also 
 in countries such as Germany and Italy which had no 
 reported cases of BSE (at the time). 
 A little bit, the school-related books has responded by paying greater attention to food safety 
 concerns. This has mostly focused on two themes. 
 The first has been to re-visit food demand studies taking into account health-driven changes in dietary patterns. Examples include Brown and Schrader (1990), 
 Burton and Young (1996), Kinnucan et al. (1997) and 
 Rickertsen and von Cramon-Taubadel (2000) among 
 others. The other main theme in the food safety

 books has been to focus on the appropriate legal/law-based structure for dealing with food safety concerns 
 (see, for example, the symposia published in the American Journal of Farming-based Money flow, December 
 1997). However, to the best of our knowledge, the books has not talked to/looked at the hit/effect of food scares on 
 the prices at different stages of the marketing chain. 
 This is the focus of the present paper which studies 
 the nature of price (change to make better/related to changing something) in the UK beef market 
 in response to the outbreak, increased knowledge and 
 likely effects of BSE. An important feature of the paper is that we think about/believe price (change to make better/related to changing something) at three stages 
 (retail, wholesale and producer) of the beef marketing chain. By doing so, we highlight not only the 
 hit/effect of price (change to make better/related to changing something) but also the effect of food 
 scares on price spreads. Our data show that prices 
 have fallen at all levels in the 1990s but that spreads 
 have not remained constant. Specifically, whereas 
 retail prices have fallen by 18%, wholesale and producer prices have fallen by around 40% each. During 
 this period all spreads have been watched/followed to grow, 
 but the retail-wholesale spread has grown five times 
 more than the wholesale-producer spread. While this 
 price decline is unsurprising in the face of increased 
 personal knowledge, the change in spreads is maybe 
 less obvious. However, as McCorriston et al. (1998) 
 show, this result is agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with the result of 
 the model of up-and-down markets in which a shock to 
 retail demand passes through a chain showed 
 by a price transmission ability to stretch that is greater than 
 togetherness. The value of the ability to stretch depends on many 
 factors, one of which is the degree of market power. 
 In this paper, we present casual (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) of 
 the data before exploring econometrically the relationships between prices along the UK's meat chain, 
 which are shown to be dependent on the (being talked about a lot on TV, online, etc.) 
 given to issues of food safety. To incorporate this scientifically, we employ a newly developed measure, the 
 'food (being talked about a lot on TV, online, etc.)' index. 
 The nature and timing of this research is smart. There 
 has been debate in the UK relating to the (casual) 
 (instance of watching, noticing, or making a statement) that price changes at the retail stage were 
 smaller than those happening at the farm level. This 
 was a principal reason for the recent Competition 
 Commission question (or investigation), which among the other things 
 (examined closely) the market power in the UK food part/area 
 with a particular focus on the up-and-down relationships. While we present no formal model of the market 
 
 structure in this paper, McCorriston et al. (1998, 1999) 
 have shown that when the markets are (in a way that is not totally pure or totally correct) 
 competitive, price (change to make better/related to changing something) will change/differ  between the 
 parts/areas. 
 Both demand and supply effects are likely to have 
 influenced the pattern of price changes in the beef part/area over the 1990s. Most obviously, the BSE problem is 
 likely to have caused moves/changes in the retail demand function for beef, which will have affected the 
 upstream prices. However, the cost side effects may 
 also be important given new meat part/area rules. 
 These have been introduced to calm people of 
 the safety of British beef in the bad after-effects of the problem and are likely to have increased costs. For example, higher charges for the Meat Cleanliness Service and 
 Specified Risk Material (SRM) disposal, reduced payments for creating and increased transactions costs 
 are commonly-thought to have (risen up/become visible) from the BSE problem 
 (Meat and Animals Commission, 1999). Costs have 
 also increased due to the greater use of Controlled Atmosphere Packaging (CAP). However, in the (not being there; not being present) 
 of reliable guesses the hit/effect of these changes is hard to (check for truth/prove true), not least because partial payment 
 was received by many of those affected. 1 Clearly, in 
 (thinking about/when one thinks about) the hit/effect of food scares on the UK beef 
 part/area, there are likely to be both demand and supply 
 factors deciding/figuring out prices at each up-and-down stage. However, as discussed in the following section, it should 
 not necessarily be expected that these (coming from the outside of something) factors should have a matching hit/effect on prices (and 
 hence price spreads) throughout the marketing chain. 
 More specifically, while the rising costs due to tighter 
 legal/law-based standards will lead to a decrease in price 
 spreads, the move/change of the retail demand function will 
 lead to an increase in price spreads. More than that, even if 
 the shift factors are equi-(fair in amount, related to something else/properly sized compared to something else), these effects 
 will not cancel out, with the retail demand shifts ruling over the hit/effect of the legal/law-based standards. 
 The paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, 
 we briefly survey both the possible and scientific 
 books relating to price (change to make better/related to changing something) in the (up and down) 
 related markets. This hints that even though the 
 prices change in the same direction, the extent of the 
 price changes change/differ  according to the retail stage and 
 hence marketing margins will change. In the case

 received by slaughterhouses (DTZ Pieda Consulting, 1998).

 studied here, marketing margins are expected to increase even if the marketing costs and the retail 
 demand curve move/change to the same extent. This not prevented by/not part of the issue, the nature of the data relating to food scares 
 would suggest that demand shifts are likely to rule. Section 3 presents the data and in Section 4 
 we discuss the (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) for the scientific analysis. 
 Admitting/recognizing/responding to the co-movement of beef prices at all 
 stages of the chain, we put into use a co-integration (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) for the scientific analysis, the results of which 
 are reported in Section 5. These show that beef prices 
 do not co-integrate without including a measure 
 of food safety (being talked about a lot on TV, online, etc.) - the food (being talked about a lot on TV, online, etc.) index. 
 The bad effect of the index differs according to 
 the marketing level and may account for the growing 
 price spreads watched/followed scientifically. Section 6 ends/decides by highlighting issues relating to the on-going 
 research. 
 
 2. Price (change to make better/related to changing something): possible 
 and scientific issues 
 2.1. Possible issues 
 In the farming-based money flow/money-based studies books, the most 
 popular (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) for (thinking about/when one thinks about) the hit/effect of (coming from the outside of something) shocks to the food part/area is in the big picture 
 of the balance displacement models starting 
 with Gardner (1975). The basis of this (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) 
 is to think about  the hit/effect of price (change to make better/related to changing something) (and 
 corresponding welfare effects) at different stages of 
 the marketing chain and how the farm-retail spread 
 may change as a result. An important feature 
 of the Gardner (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) relates to the source of 
 the (coming from the outside of something) shocks. Especially, a demand-side 
 shock directly affecting, say, the retail part/area, may 
 have a different effect on retail and farm prices than 
 a supply-side shock starting at the farm part/area. 
 However, one important criticism of the standard 
 balance displacement (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) is that it assumes 
 that the downstream food market is perfectly competitive. There is increasing (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) that this is not an 
 appropriate description of the food part/area in many 
 developed countries. For example, Bhuyan and Lopez 
 (1997) measure market power across 40 sub-parts/areas 
 of the US food industry and find that in all but three 
 cases, the null guess of competitive behaviour 
 
 349 
 
 can be rejected. Although studies of the food part/area in 
 other developed countries are usually missing, high 
 levels of concentration at least suggest that almost the same 
 things describe the food part/area in most (related to Europe) countries. More than that, the recent (act of asking questions and trying to find the truth about something) by 
 the UK Competition Commission clearly reinforces 
 the bad feeling that market power is a feature of the food 
 part/area in the UK. 
 What difference does this make to our understanding of price (change to make better/related to changing something)? Some studies from 
 the industrial organisation books have shown that 
 (not totally pure/not totally correct) competition has a big impact on 
 price (change to make better/related to changing something). Specifically, under 'reasonable' conditions, for a supply shock, price transmission is reduced if the downstream part/area is seen as 
 market power. (not very long ago), McCorriston et al. (1998) introduce market power into the Gardner (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built); 
 they show that for an increase in costs at the farm 
 level, market power in the downstream food part/area will 
 reduce the level of price (change to make better/related to changing something) compared with 
 the competitive test result. The hint/result/effect is that in 
 the presence of a supply shock at the farm level, the 
 model (describes the future) a narrowing of price spreads. The same 
 holds true for a move/change in the marketing services supply 
 function which takes by force/takes control of the increase in costs due to 
 tighter legal/law-based standards. Under (not totally pure/not totally correct) competition, an increase in the input costs causes retail prices 
 to rise but this increase is (along with something else/related to something else) less than the 
 increase in input costs. As a result, price spreads 
 should narrow where processing costs increase. 
 However, this still leaves open the issue of the 
 source of the (coming from the outside of something) shock. As highlighted above, 
 telling the difference between a demand and cost shock matters. McCorriston et al. (1999) also think about/believe this issue 
 and label price (change to make better/related to changing something) due to a demand shock affecting the retail part/area as a 'pass-back' effect. They 
 show formally that for an inward move/change in the demand 
 function, market power in the downstream food part/area 
 will increase the importance of the price changes happening upstream compared to the competitive test result. In other words, price changes at the farm level 
 will be greater than those happening at the retail level 
 for a given move/change in the retail demand function. The 
 hint/result/effect is that price spreads should widen following such a demand shock. Given that the meat part/area 
 was likely to be subject to both sources of (coming from the outside of something) 
 change over the 1990s, the hit/effect on prices at each 
 up-and-down stage (and, by extension, the development of 
 
 350 
 
 T Lloyd et al. I Farming-based Money flow 25 (2001) 347-357 
 
 price spreads) will be the net result of both sources 
 of (coming from the outside of something) shocks to the beef part/area. More than that, 
 even if marketing costs and the demand curve shifted 
 by equal amounts, the move/change in the retail demand function should rule the hit/effect of the rise in the costs 
 connected with tighter legal/law-based standards. So, 
 unless the extent of marketing cost increases was 
 significantly greater than the direct effect of the food 
 scares (which is unlikely to be the case), good  we 
 should expect to watch/notice a widening of price spreads 
 over this period in the presence of market power. 
 
 2.2. Scientific issues 
 More and more studies focus on the scientific parts of price (change to make better/related to changing something) in the farming-based and 
 related markets. Because of the seen/obvious co-movement 
 in prices, many of these recent studies apply a 
 co-integration way(s) of doing things since it, (a) accounts appropriately for the time-series properties of the data 
 and, (b) measures the short-run and long-run nature 
 of price (change to make better/related to changing something). Examples of such studies include 
 von Cramon-Taubadel (1998), Chang and Griffith 
 (1998) and Goodwin and Holt (1999) among others. 
 The last thing just mentioned two papers differ from the earlier books 
 in that they focus on many stages of the marketing 
 chain by separately identifying price (change to make better/related to changing something) at 
 the farm, wholesale and retail levels, a practice that is 
 also followed in this paper. However, in most cases, 
 these scientific studies confine the sources of price 
 (change to make better/related to changing something) to be 'within' the food chain. (coming from the outside of something) influences, apart from a time (popular thing/general way things are going) or a given 
 (related to what holds something together and makes it strong) break, are not here. 
 In summary, (asking lots of questions about/trying to find the truth about) the hit/effect of food scares, 
 it is important to recognise that this type of (coming from the outside of something) 
 shock represents mostly a demand-side move/change to the 
 food part/area. As a result, it is reasonable to expect price 
 (change to make better/related to changing something) in the upstream stages of the marketing 
 chain. However, the extent of these price changes will 
 change/differ  between the stages if the downstream parts/areas 
 are seen as (not totally pure/not totally correct) competition. Although 
 the analysis of price (change to make better/related to changing something) is not a formal test 
 of market power, higher levels of price (change to make better/related to changing something) in 
 the upstream stages are certainly agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with it. 
 If the extent of price changes between each marketing stage differs/changes, this hints that the price spreads 
 (or marketing margin) will also change. Where 
 prices are non-unmoving and possibly show 
 
 co-movement, a co-integration (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) offers an 
 appropriate way(s) of doing things for (thinking about/when one thinks about) the extent of 
 price (change to make better/related to changing something). The data and the role of food scares 
 on the beef market are organized and listed in the next section. 
 
 3. Data issues and 'food scares' 
 We employ real beef prices at the producer, wholesaler and store level (P1 , W1 and R 1 , (match up each pair of items in order)) 
 in England and Wales. The data have been calculated 
 by the Meat and Animals Commission and represent 
 dead body weight equals (CWE) to help direct 
 comparison of prices at all the three stages. The data 
 are monthly and cover the period from January 1990 
 to December 1998 (see Figs. 1 and 2). 2 They are (lowered/flattened from losing air) by the Retail Price Index (January 1999 base) 
 and clearly show a (lowering in number/getting worse) (popular thing/general way things are going) over the period. 
 Retail prices fell by 60 pence/kg, wholesale prices by 
 69 pence/kg and producer prices by 75 pence/kg over 
 the period. Casual (careful examination of something) of Fig. 1 also shows/tells about that 
 prices have a habit/desire to co-move, in that price movements at one level of the chain seem to be reflected in 
 prices in other places in the chain. 
 These price series are helped by a 'food 
 (being talked about a lot on TV, online, etc.) index', which is a count of the number of articles printed in broad-sheet newspapers on a monthly 
 basis that relate to the safety of meat. In general, 
 these reports are negative in nature and show the 
 concerns (related to/looking at/thinking about) the safety of meat, in terms of its 
 production and processing. Articles relating to BSE 
 rule the index although other almost the same  topics such 
 as health standards in slaughterhouses are also covered. The 
 index reflects personal concerns (related to/looking at/thinking about) the safety 
 parts of meat consumption and also the hit/effect of 
 regulation on the suppliers of meat. As a result, the 
 index will be related to the developments that 
 affect both the demand and supply of beef, though it 
 is likely to be the food scares issue that rules 
 given the public angere over BSE. In the scientific 
 analysis, the natural log of this index (represented it) is 
 used. A plot of the series is shown in Fig. 3. Increased Dickey-Fuller tests point to/show that each price 
 series and i1 are (having different things working together as one unit) of order 1 [/(1)]_), as visual 
 (careful examination of something) of Figs. 1 and 3 suggests.

 4. Way(s) of doing things 
 
 Table I 
 Co-integration test results 
 
 The formal analysis is done in a vector autoregressive (VAR) (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) to use (for selfish reasons) properties 
 of (combination of different things together that work as one unit) and co-integration that may exist in the 
 data. VAR methods offer a easily-controlled (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) for the 
 (act of asking questions and trying to find the truth about something) of energetic relations, especially when 
 the (numbers that change/things that change) are co-integrated. Think about/believe a VAR(k) 
 model,

 where Xt is a (n x 1) vector of I(l) (numbers that change/things that change), each IT; 
 (i = 1, ... , k) is an (n x n) matrix of coefficients to 
 be guessed using a (t = 1, ... , T) sample of data 
 and et is a (n x 1) vector of errors with a non-diagonal 
 covariance matrix. The order (k) of the VAR is also 
 figured out by/decided by the data, and here we adopt the Schwarz 
 Information Judging requirement (SIC) for this purpose. 
 Co-integration is tested using methods developed by Johansen (1988). Following Stock and 
 Watson (1988), it is well known that with n (numbers that change/things that change) 
 there can be at the most n - l co-integrating relations 
 and n - r common (popular things/general ways things are going) in the system. Therefore, 
 with a triplet of prices, there can be at the most two 
 such co-integrating combinations, since if any two 
 pairs of prices co-move (co-integrate) then so must the 
 third. In this case, the prices share a single common 
 (popular thing/general way things are going) and may be expected to co-move over time. 
 Given the (problems, delays, etc.) that can be met understanding/explaining the coefficients of multiple co-integrating vectors (Ltitkepohl and Reimers, 1992) sudden desire response 
 functions are commonly calculated to test the time 
 path of the (numbers that change/things that change) in x 1 to (coming from the outside of something) shocks in such 
 &#126;ircu&#126;stances. The (like the real thing) time paths are found by 
 1mposmg a recursive structure on the moving average representation of the VAR and represent the time 
 path of the changeable i with respect to a unit shock to 
 the changeable j, s periods ago, all other (numbers that change/things that change) at the 
 time of the shock (and earlier) held constant. Since our 
 principal interest is in the effect of health information 
 on prices, orthogonalised sudden desires are adopted here 
 given that in the current application changes in the 
 food (being talked about a lot on TV, online, etc.) index are likely to drive price changes 
 and not the other way around, too. Given that prices at all stages of 
 the marketing chain may respond together to such 
 shocks, this orthogonalisation is good since

 5. Results 
 As an first step, Eq. (1) is guessed for the price 
 triplet (Rt. W1 and P 1 ). An (having no limits, rules, or barriers) VAR(l2) 
 model, increased by four sudden desire dummy (numbers that change/things that change) 3 
 gives a good guess, such that extras/payments obey the stated ideas (you think are true) of e 1 in (1). 
 Given that prices are /(1), the model is examined 
 for the presence of co-integration suggested by the 
 co-movement of prices seen/obvious in Fig. l. Panel (a) 
 of Table 1 reports the co-integration test statistics for 
 this model. 
 While there appears to be an indication of 
 co-integration among the triplet, the formal (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) 
 is at the best weak. Specifically, the trace test statistic 
 rejects the null guess of no co-integration at the 
 5% importance, but the maximal eigenvalue test does 
 not. Also, the test statistics do not provide any 
 (enough to be meaningful) (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) of the multiple co-integrating relationships suggested by the pair-wise co-movement 
 of the data. One literal (understanding/ explanation) of this result is 
 that the beef markets are poorly (combined different things together so they worked as one unit). Or, the explanation might lie in the role of left-out 
 (numbers that change/things that change), especially, given the previous/coming before discus3 Dummies are for 1993(3), 1995(9), 1996(3) and 1996(4). While 
 they have a very small hit/effect on limit/guideline guesses, they are 
 included to make happy the (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy)ity idea (you think is true).

 sion, the hit/effect of BSE and related health concerns 
 on price movements. 
 Increasing the price transmission model with (the 
 natural logarithm of) the food (being talked about a lot on TV, online, etc.) index it has a 
 marked effect on guessing. As the results in Panel (b) 
 of Table 1 show, (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) in favour of co-integration is 
 now much stronger: the trace and maximal eigenvalue 
 test statistics now reject the null of no co-integration at 
 the 1% importance level. More than that, both tests suggest 
 the presence of three co-integrating vectors, a result 
 agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with pair-wise co-movement (in combination with the food scares (number or thing that changes)). 4 The clear end of/final opinion of the co-integration analysis is that the food 
 (being talked about a lot on TV, online, etc.) index plays an important in the long-run (change over time) of the UK beef prices and that once the effect 
 of the index is taken into account, prices co-move in 
 a manner agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with market (combination of different things together that work as one unit). 
 The above result begs some questions, not 
 least those relating to the exact role that the food 
 (being talked about a lot on TV, online, etc.) index plays in price (creation and construction/ group of objects). To (ask lots of questions about/try to find the truth about) 
 this issue, Fig. 4 shows the orthogonalised sudden desire 
 response functions of the three beef prices to a unit 
 ( 1%) shock in the food (being talked about a lot on TV, online, etc.) index. These point to/show 
 that the increased (being talked about a lot on TV, online, etc.) (related to/looking at/thinking about) food safety at first increases beef prices at all stages of the marketing chain, but that after that, they fall. The long-run 
 effect is negative on all beef prices, with the guesses 
 suggesting that retail, wholesale and producer prices 
 fall by 1.70, 2.25 and 3.0 pence/kg, (match up each pair of items in order). This 
 goes along with a food (being talked about a lot on TV, online, etc.) ability to stretch of around 
 1.4. 5 
 As an helping to these results, forecast error rottings may also be calculated. These guess the 
 proportion of the total variance of each of the prices 
 that is due to an orthogonalised shock measured at clearly stated/particular periods of time (or space) following this shock (Hamilton, 1994 ). 
 The results suggest that the effects on prices stabilise 
 some 30 months following a shock to the index which 
 accounts for about 6, 11 and 61% of the difference/different version in the retail, wholesale and producer prices, (match up each pair of items in order). 
 4 Using the limited sample correction to the asymptotic critical 
 values suggested by Reimers (1992) does not change this end/end result, although the P-values of the test are conespondingly larger. 
 Specifically, while the null of no cointegration cannot be rejected 
 at the 10% level in panel (a), it is rejected in panel (b) at tbis level. 
 5 At mean values, the food scares elasticities are 1.27, 1.60 and 
 1.12, (match up each pair of items in order). 
 
 The results show two features: (1) That the 
 UK beef prices were (able to reply or react/quick to respond) to the public's knowledge of food safety issues (mostly BSE) in the 
 1990s but (2) that the hit/effect was not common across 
 stages in the marketing chain. This second point hints that price spreads also move in a planned way in response to (being talked about a lot on TV, online, etc.) about the safety of food. Shocks to 
 the food (being talked about a lot on TV, online, etc.) index cause the wholesale-producer 
 price spreads to expand more than the retail-wholesale 
 price spreads. More than that, the difference between retail and producer prices, the measure that receives 
 most attention in the public debate on this issue, rises 
 by an even larger amount in response to BSE (being talked about a lot on TV, online, etc.). Specifically, a 1% increase in the food (being talked about a lot on TV, online, etc.) index causes a 0.5 pence/kg increase in the 
 retail-wholesale spread, 0.75 pence/kg increase in the 
 wholesale-producer spread and so a 1.25 pence/kg 
 increase in the retail-producer spread. Given that the 
 media interest has generally risen over the sample period, price spreads are watched/followed to rise over time. 
 The (instance of watching, noticing, or making a statement) that the food (being talked about a lot on TV, online, etc.) index should 
 lead to (lower in number/get worse) in prices at each marketing stage is, to 
 a large degree, expected and agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with the control of the demand relative to supply sources (i.e. 
 due to increased regulation) of (coming from the outside of something) shocks in 
 the beef part/area over the 1990s. That this price decline 
 should change/differ  between stages is a little more surprising, 
 especially given the nature of the data which, being 
 agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with fixed proportions technology, might 
 otherwise suggest that all the price declines be equal. 
 The fact that these price declines change/differ  between stages, 
 leading to a widening of price spreads, is a strong sign of 
 a food chain seen as some degree of market 
 power at wholesale and retail stages. 
 
 6. Ends/end results 
 This paper has focussed on the hit/effect of (being talked about a lot on TV, online, etc.), mostly concerns relating to BSE, on 
 price transmission in the UK beef part/area during the 
 1990s. Admitting/recognizing/responding to the co-movement that exists 
 between prices in the meat marketing chain, we use a 
 co-integrating (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built), the results of which show 
 the importance of information, as included in a 
 food (being talked about a lot on TV, online, etc.) index, in price transmission. Prices at 
 all levels have tended to decrease during the 1990s, 
 a result that is agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with inward moves/changes of the 
 
 T. Lloyd et a!./Agricultural Money flow 25 (2001) 347-357 
 
 demand function. Maybe more interesting is that the 
 extent of price (change to make better/related to changing something) differs/changes between marketing 
 stages. Especially, prices at the retail (wholesale) 
 level decline but less so than prices at the wholesale 
 (farm) level. While supply side shocks may also have 
 been seen/obvious in the UK beef part/area over the 1990s 
 due to increased regulation, the fact that widening 
 margins are watched/followed suggests the control of 
 demand-side moves/changes in a market that does not go along with/match up to a perfectly competitive model. Although 
 the results presented in this paper do not make up/be equal to a 
 formal test of market power, they lend support to the 
 UK's Competition Commission (act of asking questions and trying to find the truth about something) into the 
 degree of market power in the food part/area. A more 
 formal test for market power in (up and down) integrated 
 markets is the subject of our on-going research.
