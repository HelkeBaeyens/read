 Introduction 
 Last ten years is seen as different types of problems and shocks in the (how money affects people's lives) 
 systems, creating a mixed-up/disturbed big picture  and calling for a better understanding of what the energetic 
 (way of seeing things / sensible view of what is and is not important) of change is. For countries, areas and cities a better understanding of governace 
 asks and calls for action. 
 Toughness is gaining attention in social sciences, in general, and in (related to a large area) studies, in 
 particular. The idea  has been especially useful to rethink (related to a large area) development models 
 in the (related to Europe) Union when (combining different things together so they work as one unit) the (thing that's given/work that's done) of new and interesting patterns in (related to a large area) 
 plans and also in (thinking about/when one thinks about) prevention and planning (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth), (related to how much money and power people have) and 
 (related to computers and science) risks. 
 Toughness is commonly seen as having an engineering (way of seeing things / sensible view of what is and is not important), if focusing the 
 return to a steady-state balance, and an (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) (way of seeing things / sensible view of what is and is not important), if paying more attention 
 to the carrying ability (to hold or do something) of the system as it soaks up shocks without losing its properties 
 (Simmie &amp; Martin, 2010). Today's use of the "toughness" (physical thing that refers to an idea or emotion) in social sciences needs/demands 
 (lots of serious thought)s to avoid frequent fuzzy meanings (Davoudi et al., 2012). The (related to things slowly changing for the better over time) 
 Money-based (the study of (or the location of) mountains, rivers, hills, etc.) School suggests connecting the idea  to ideas that allow reflecting 
 how different (related to how much money and power people have) systems at different scales are able of surviving, recovering, 
 re-orientating and renewing themselves when argued with with external disruptions or internal 
 (deep-down/basic) failures. In this way toughness is being (discussed back and forth) (combining different things together so they work as one unit) an (related to things slowly changing for the better over time) approach 
 (Boschma, 2015) and (showing or proving) how complex systems change  and change. The vision of 
 complex (able to change and get better) systems is very rich as it helps to clear up the newly-seen (features/ qualities/ traits) at 
 multi-level interactions (Cooke, 2012), uncovering, for example, the (machines/methods/ways) that enable 
 top-down and bottom-up change linking (land areas owned or controlled by someone) at different levels, with systems and 
 networks, with clearly stated/particular organisations, their behaviours, routines and (rewards or reasons for doing something). It is clear that 
 toughness, and (related to a large area) toughness especially, require effective invention of new things systems (Simmie, 
 2014) as invention of new things is a central aspect of the helpful change and (ability to change) of (land areas owned or controlled by someone). The 
 micro-(things that decide other things) of toughness are important, connected with the energetic abilities of 
 organizations (Teece, 1999). 
 For toughness (serious thought/something to think about/respect), the Public Part/area plays a important role. The State has a important 
 role in the coordination and control of market exchange and it is central to create the 
 institutional (related to the beautiful design and construction of buildings, etc.)s that create advantages sometimes (Hall &amp; Thelen, 2009). The State 
 11 
 
 is an causer of invention of new things and new activities, both by supporting and enforcing new laws (and law making) 
 but also by public purchase, owning products that stimulate other money-based agents 
 (Uyarra et al. 2013). 
 
 Organization of the book 
 This book is a (thing that's given/work that's done) to the debate of toughness applied to the Portuguese case. 
 Organized in eight chapters, a few (things that are given/work that's done) from the Portuguese reality are gathered on 
 topics such as the definition of policies for tough (land areas owned or controlled by someone), supply networks of public services, 
 invention of new things in businesses/projects. Knowledge management in the tourist industry, toughness in (away from cities) 
 areas, city-based  regeneration plans, and (related to computers and science) learning as an organizational toughness 
 (machine/method/way) are explored also. 
 After the introductory chapter, in chapter 2 Luis Grave underlines that the development 
 of complex city-based  systems is subject to different factors influenced by the goals of the 
 established land-based policies or city-based  development agents. There are possible risks and 
 hits/effects of land use in result of external factors against set goals and desired patterns. It 
 is necessary to prevent and overcome these harmful effects through (able to change and get better) management of 
 land use management able to expect and think about/believe (serving to stop something bad before it happens)ly, possible future pictures/situations 
 contraries to set development plans and set safer development goals or adopting (related to a plan to reach a goal) 
 (change to make better/related to changing something) rules in order to avoid harmful energetic of the constant balancing of the city-based 
 system. How to configure this management is the challenge. As a starting point and basis for 
 this approach, the author found an area on the south bank of the Tagus river suffering from 
 a big picture  of spoiling after an sudden stop of the fast city-based  growth that was happening, 
 caused by construction of the 'Vasco da Gama Bridge'. From the hits/effects on land use this 
 chapter went to look (for)  the necessary responses in terms of (machines/methods/ways) and procedures that 
 should be included in land management so that it can avoid such bad effects. In the end, 
 it identifies the possible benefits that could result, if applied in the same big picture, through the 
 proposed (able to change and get better) land use management system model. 
 Chapter 3 by Ricardo Book, Jose Afonso Teixeira and Margarida Pereira debates the relevance 
 of public services which due to their universal and (including everything) character lessen social (states where two things are not the same), 
 help develop money-based growth and bring (groups of people/animals/things) and (land areas owned or controlled by someone) closer, also making them more 
 tough and organized. In Portugal, after restoring a democratic government (1974), joining the EEC/EU 
 (1986) and, at a different level, information and communication inventions, have 
 added/gave to the (act of something getting bigger, wider, etc.) and modernisation of public services. The extension of required 
 education and the opening of access to college, the creation of the National Health 
 Service and the (making something available to, and controlled by, all people) of justice have needed/demanded expanding the (pertaining to each person or thing) networks 
 of facilities, inventions and good training. Public (related to managing and running a company or organization) services have 
 been rebuilt, formats (branched out/done different things), technology included and networks (combined different things together so they worked as one unit). 
 Neoliberalism and the money-based and money problem (2008) weakened the Welfare State through 
 the sub-contracting of services, (reasons) of useful things/valuable supplies, defence of contracting models 
 and (turning things over from the government to private companies). This chapter reflects on the role of public services in land-based toughness 
 and sticking together, showing the changes in the public services for education, health, justice and 
 Invention of new things for Toughness 
 
 management in Portugal and some reorganization results of the problem. Based on three 
 case studies, it also analyses patterns of the use of services in different (related to where mountains, rivers, cities, etc., are located) contexts 
 (densely urbanised, (away from cities) and change (land areas owned or controlled by someone)). 
 In chapter 4 Silvia Fernandes, Marisa CesÃ¡rio, Bruno Jesus and Jose Monteiro Barata identify 
 the parts/areas of the Portuguese (process of people making, selling, and buying things) that most participate in cooperation to create something new and 
 which sources/agents are most used in the process, watched/followed by part/area and type of invention of new things. 
 Using the data from the Community Invention of new things Survey (CIS-2012), it first judges the nature of 
 the invention of new things process in terms of cooperation or firm-based invention of new things, and then (makes different) 
 the results by part/area illustrating which cooperation sources/agents are most used (scope) and 
 relative strength (scale). The results suggest that main creating new things parts/areas in the Portuguese 
 (process of people making, selling, and buying things) are research-based, knowledge-based, and service-based. The external sources/agents 
 most commonly used by the first are universities, suppliers by the second and firms' group by 
 the third. Private customers are important sources in general, what means that Portuguese 
 firms use customers' information and market relations for invention of new things purposes. These results 
 are in line with the fact that Portuguese firms are mainly small and medium-sized (SME) and 
 more and more focused on services and knowledge. 
 Carolina Alves, Adelia Nunes and Joana Silva describe the case of Serra da Estrela in chapter 
 5. As a area of mountains, seen as low density of population with an weird position, 
 remote and connected to physical and natural restrictions, the construction of more tough 
 (land areas owned or controlled by someone) can become a path towards the stimulation of development. The main issue of this 
 work is to understand in what way the fixing of clearly stated/particular business makes up a  structuring 
 element of social and (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) toughness. Through the (improvement in value or status) of (workers in general/hiring, training, and firing department) 
 and improvement of potentialities of this (land area owned or controlled by someone) such as local products, (surrounding conditions) and 
 (wide view of a nature scene/wide area of beautiful land), the widening and (getting involved with different types of things; not sticking with only one thing) of the offer rises. However, bottlenecks are still to 
 be thought about/believed such as the non-coming together with other local business interferes with the creation of a 
 more organized, competitive and tough (land area owned or controlled by someone). 
 Chapter 6, by Bernadete Dias Sequeira, JoÃ£o Filipe Marques and Antonio Serrano, presents 
 some of the main results of a research about knowledge management in the hospitality 
 organisations in the Algarve area. Its main goal is to understand, from a people-based 
 (way of seeing things / sensible view of what is and is not important), how hotels create or get, keep/hold, share and use their organizational knowledge. 
 A complete model of analysis providing an (combined different things together so they worked as one unit) summary of knowledge management 
 was specially developed for this goal. The model is organized around two (related to careful studying or deep thinking) axes: the first 
 identifies the main steps of the knowledge management process (creation/acquisition, storage, 
 move (from one place to another) and use) and the second lists and describes the management practices that help 
 this process. Given that invention of new things is a very important result of knowledge management 
 as a whole, this chapter focus on the last dimension, the use of organizational knowledge. 
 The scientific research consists in three case studies of hotel groups operating in the Algarve, 
 using semi-structured interviews to the hotel's managing staff and a survey given to a 
 layered sample of workers. 
 In chapter 7, Celia Marisa Fonseca Ferreira, Teresa SÃ¡ Marques and Paula Guerra underline 
 that the structure and organization of (process of people making, selling, and buying things) of cities results from both individual actions 
 of many money-based agents (people, families, business, government institutions, (branched out/done different things) 
 organizations) and from the network of relationships established between them. The authors 
 13 
 
 used 24 interviews to retail part/area business (help increase/show in a good way)rs and money-based-oriented efforts 
 developers, carried out during 2015, to understand the (desires to do things/reasons to do things), expectations and (problems, delays, etc.) 
 involved in opening of business or managing and doing efforts, the location factors, the partnerships 
 and institutional support, as well as aspects related to invention of new things in the city centre of Oporto. 
 This analysis adds/gives to the studies of bottom-up efforts in the big picture  of money-based 
 development, and so support the description/separation of (people and businesses that are not part of the government) plans as well as help to 
 support description/separation of public policies. 
 In the final chapter 8, Teresa Noronha and Victoria Del Pino focus on the need for going 
 back to the classical methods of (thinking about/when one thinks about) the savings that repeating processes introduce 
 in the learning process of firms. Total experience leads to performance improvement 
 and may fill part of the existing knowledge gap based upon the Experience Curve (EC). The 
 Microalgae Production Systems (MPS) was used for this research (thinking about/when one thinks about) that it is one 
 of the most exciting future-oriented business areas of modern scientific procedures, which have 
 turned into an important worldwide  industry, with a (branched out/done different things) field of applications. So, the 
 particularities of learning and experience collection processes have been used to end/decide 
 about the behaviour differences/different versions of the EC, by exploring and detecting some applications and 
 misapplications of the idea. The research way(s) of doing things is based on the case-study of Necton 
 S.A., a pioneer Portuguese firm, dedicated, since 1997, to microalgae (producing crops/helping something grow). Before this 
 chapter, an in deep research of these authors tried to understand the technical complex difficulty 
 of microalgae science. The ends/end results focused on in this chapter confirm that: i) the 
 different MPS follow an experience curve, with progress ratios which are in between the ones 
 decided/figured out for manufacturing firms and energy technologies; ii) the learning (machines/methods/ways) play 
 a almost the same  role through the technologies life-cycle, although the MPS studied are different in 
 (related to computers and science) complex difficulty; and, finally and most important, iii) learning-by-doing is more related 
 in early technology stages, learning-by-using appears to be basic in the maturity stage, 
 and learning-by-searching is very important to solve particular technical restrictions. This perception is 
 very useful in the design of target plans for invention of new things under holds back such as (money-related) 
 disruptive or (money-based)/cheaply falling behind (surrounding conditions). 
 
 that are creative and enhacers of knowledge production and exchenage (Balland, 
 Suire, &amp; Vicente, 2013), the policies for stimulating a smart (focusing on doing one thing very well) (Trip/attack, David, 
 &amp; Hall, 2011) and the abilities of firms and other key invention of new things actors (OECD, 2009). 
 - Toughness and risk - shocks and internal disruptions need to be talked to/looked at. The studies 
 of risk management, especially (connected/related) in city-based  and land-based physical planning, will 
 include necessarily new dimensions of (related to how much money and power people have) and (related to computers and science) toughness 
 (Alexander, 2013; Allan &amp; Bryant, 2012; Dawley, Pike, &amp; Tomaney, 2010). 
 - Toughness and land-based renewal - (land areas owned or controlled by someone) are living organisms that develop and 
 grow but may also (mentally sick person) and die. Policy-makers and research will pay particular 
 attention to the (machines/methods/ways) that can increase the life-cycle of specific groups (Ebbekink 
 &amp; Lagendijk, 2013), that can increase the (wanting to beat others in contests) and sticking together of money-based base 
 (Bristow, 2010), increase closeness and related variety (Frenken, Van Oort, &amp; Verburg, 
 2007), and stimulate the factors of (quality of being unlike anything else in the world) and that (promise that something will definitely happen or that something will definitely work as described) a long-standing place 
 in the (world-wide process of people making, selling, and buying things). 
 The book hopes to add/give to the combining of the idea  of toughness, both in 
 scientific research and land-based planning. Useful to (people who work to find information) and students, it supplies a 
 (branched out/done different things) and balanced selection of cases related to management and promotion of land-based 
 development in hard  conditions. Portuguese (related to a large area) reality exposed and discussed in deep, 
 this way, became a promising field of study (by itself/in and of itself).

 A research (list of things to deal with/desire to reach a goal) 
 It is expected that different types of shocks, (related to how much money and power people have), (related to information about people), (related to computers and science), 
 (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth), (money-related), will speed up, uncovering the shortages and (related to what holds something together and makes it strong) problems of 
 modern society. Toughness can become a critical area of research related to risk management 
 and helping the deep understanding and helping action in a changing (surrounding conditions). The 
 results presented in this book confirm the fast-growing books in the topic, highlighting three 
 (connected/related) fields for the Toughness research (list of things to deal with/desire to reach a goal): 
 - Toughness and invention of new things - studying how invention of new things increases at a multi-level (way of seeing things / sensible view of what is and is not important) 
 the toughness of different systems. This will necessarily include the studies of different 
 national setups that are more friendly and supportive of invention of new things (Amable 
 &amp; Lung, 2008), different systems and network setups that create eco-systems

 The city-based  system is a permanent complex construction, with the aim of conditioning 
 (community of people/all good people in the world), its culture and activities more (able to be harmed by) different influences and restrictions. Caused 
 patterns happen within its development, decided/figured out both by prior planning, and by unforeseen 
 and bad externalities to thought out plans, leading to (qualities that show weakness because something important isn't steady or strong) or even processes with a 
 negative habit/desire. This was the case with the recent money-based and money problem which resulted 
 in a big picture  of spoiling or even (time period where people and businesses made less money) for city-based  development in the combined city and 
 the city-based  space in (act of something getting bigger, wider, etc.) or combining. The findings here are reflected in the following 
 statement of extreme surprise: could it be that nobody predicted this, and why? It is my belief that it 
 in fact matters that policy in general and (related to space or existing in space) planning as control of cities owns the 
 ability to predict, as far as possible, the distant results of its own decisions and the 
 effects of externalities on city-based  development, that is, that for a (able to last/helping the planet) and tough city-based 
 development, this can be carried out using a permanently changed plan for a (serving to stop something bad before it happens) and 
 not only positivist possible/likely. 
 However, the city, from the land-based point of view, consists of an city-based  system with a 
 complex multifunctionality and structure. Therefore, in order to (accomplish or gain with effort) the previously-mentioned 
 control of (able to last/helping the planet) and tough cities, this should be supported by a management system 
 capable of (in a way that produces a lot with very little waste) managing that complex difficulty. However, either due to the inefficiency of its 
 practices or due to the ineffectiveness of its results, it can be seen that land-based management 
 has shown itself unable to expect and monitor the changeable nature of city-based  systems (forms and 
 functions) caused by actual change patterns. The positivist planning that has lasted 
 has failed, since it is based on policies and tests/lists of questions managed segmentally and part/areaally, 
 where the definition of plans does not go along with/match up to a prior planned test, as well 
 as the definition of plans not going along with/matching up to actions begun/tried, showing, through the 
 disconnected health of the world and the functioning city-based  systems, that it is important to 
 have a management system supported by planning based on a prior planned test of 
 the contexts which are the object of management action.

 Objectives and organizational structure 
 The growing complex difficulty of city-based  systems needs/demands approaches which traditional planning 
 has not gave/given. To respond to the complex difficulty, doubt and risks brought about by 
 (when lots of countries communicate and talk with each other) and (related to computers and science) progress, studies involving the future, pictures/situations and (related to a plan to reach a goal) 
 planning have been seen by some as a doable/possible other choice, more and more used as (showing the ability to create interesting new things) and 
 cooperative basis for decision making processes (Bina et al., 2014). 
 Therefore, the challenge is: how to design and operationalize planning/territorial management (tools or objects used to do work or measure something) and processes capable of controlling and managing the development of city-based 
 spaces in a balanced and (able to last/helping the planet) manner, (even though there is the existence of) uncertainties and troubles, (in other words) tough 
 city-based  development? 
 Our starting point is the hits/effects, (in other words) in (related to space or existing in space) planning (SP) in a case study within a 
 big picture  of spoiling after caused speeded up city-based  growth, for which there is a need to 
 find responses to the resulting challenge faced there. Starting from explanations of self-controlled 
 (related to a plan to reach a goal) planning, a search for new and interesting aspects is carried out through a (related to the whole) approach, 
 within the fields of planning for doubt, the ideas of (combined different things together so they worked as one unit) (related to a plan to reach a goal) management 
 and management performance test, applied to (able to last/helping the planet) city-based  planning, looking (for) 
 ideas and ways of doing things which make up a land-based management (TM) model gave/given 
 with (able to change and get better) planning. The end/end result will summarize the benefits which can follow from the 
 proposals developed. 
 
 Tagus river. This was therefore, another typical case of city-based  (act of something getting bigger, wider, etc.) caused by road 
 (set of machines). 
 The big thing/the important event of (act of something getting bigger, wider, etc.) was expected and even desired, so the local cities, 
 when developing the (pertaining to each person or thing) city-based master plans (MMP), which decided/figured out the 
 classification of land use, pictured large borders of areas to be urbanised. The Government 
 established a (when things become more valuable) tax on the land and real estate markets, gave a reason for by the national 
 investment which had happened. We then saw that the actual management put into use 
 policies which, (probably) reasonable by local development and public money-related (the ability to keep something around, or keep something going), 
 (helped increase/showed in a good way) and even focused on stimulating city-based  (act of something getting bigger, wider, etc.)ism. However, the process of 
 growth and combining was still happening when the worldwide  money problem happened and 
 spoiling of that growth happened with negative reflexes of a varied order on (the health of the Earth/the surrounding conditions)al, 
 money-based and (money-related) conditions of a broken-up and unfinished city-based  space. 
 The big picture  described can be seen as one of the main case studies clearly connected with or related to the support 
 (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) analysis for the design of the MT system model that has been developed here. To 
 do this it has been necessary to focus (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) on the city-based  centres of Alcochete, Montijo 
 and Pinhal Novo (Fig. 1) which are the closest collections to the first access points from the 
 IP1-A12 (south side of the Vasco da Gama Bridge) and in which the city-based  boom caused by the 
 new (set of machines) was most famous.

 A case of city-based  spoiling and diseconomy 
 Big-picture relatedization of the case study 
 Since it joined the (related to Europe) Union (former EEC), Portugal saw a huge boost in its 
 (set of machines) and land-based facilities. Regarding (set of machines), road links improved the most. 
 The only connection of Lisbon with the south of the country was made using the 25 de Abril 
 Bridge, and this needed to be strengthened along with accessibilities to the Lisbon Universal 
 Exhibition, which was held in 1998. So, the construction of the Vasco da Gama Bridge from 
 the location of Expo 98 completed the second connection of Lisbon to the southern motorway, 
 crossing the south-east part/area of the southern side of the city-based area, which was then 
 not important compared to the central element (Lisbon), only connected by river transport routes 
 and with an city-based  occupation made up of small-sized combined city-based  collections of a 
 somewhat (expected/able to be known beforehand) size. 
 Given the amazing/single facts or conditions that surround that situation and the importance of the investment, 
 the effort to construct the Vasco da Gama Bridge was taken significantly in advance and 
 was highly mediatized. This was a time of city-based  (act of something getting bigger, wider, etc.) and increasing ability to move around through 
 individual transportation. So, as was expected, with this new access to that smaller area having 
 been done, there was an sudden desire in the market for land and real estate in the city-based 
 centres located close to the first local accesses to this new link between the two banks of the

 This reflection is based on the analysis and argument between city-based management 
 models (instruments and practices) used in different examples of a way of thinkingatic case study, 
 testing them and relating them with the (pertaining to each person or thing) effects on (related to space or existing in space) management and 
 (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) and money-based (the ability to keep something around, or keep something going). So, the relation between the big thing/the important event 
 of city-based  growth with different MT practices and the city-based  action carried out in the city-based 
 border of Alcochete, Montijo and Pinhal Novo were watched/followed, trying to identify the (popular things/general ways things are going), 
 planning, mid-term planning and programming, that formed factors which led to the (deep-down/basic) 
 weird things which shaped the (land area owned or controlled by someone) in those money-based and (money-related) facts or conditions (that surround someone).

 in the provision of facilities and functions or services involving total use - not combined in 
 certain city-based  areas with the facilities built being oversized (related to/looking at/thinking about) needs, forever, others 
 without such facilities due to a lack of reason to construct the planned facilities.

 Below the (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) identified in the examples analysed will be presented, systematising the 
 (popular things/general ways things are going) watched/followed in the MT performance. 
 Trends in the planning and programming of the city-based  space: (i) Planning with weak support 
 concerning vision and (related to a plan to reach a goal) weighting; (ii) Over sizing of the space to be urbanised, at the 
 expense of healing/fixing and bridging urbanised spaces - disqualification, breaking (up), 
 breaking up/spreading out; (iii) The (existing all over a large area) (not being there; not being present) of described/explained plans and other forms of city-based  programming; 
 (iv) When partial use was made of PP, as happened in one of the examples analysed, there 
 were important/famous contrasts in the quality clearness between the spaces developed in a clear/separate 
 manner; (v) Generalised irresponsibility (related to/looking at/thinking about) the (money-related) plans in the land-based management 
 instruments (TMI), especially more demanding in the UP and PP, generally not present when 
 testing their money-based ability to be done; (vi) Poor use of the land to be urbanised, less than 50%, after 
 15 years following the approval of the MDP; (vii) The city-based  growth was as large as close to this 
 (equal (popular thing/general way things are going) in the slowing of the construction space). 
 Trends in the effects built-in to the control and management practices for city-based 
 putting into use: (i) Reduced use of programming and city-based  calming (machines/methods/ways); (ii) 
 Reduced use of management methods and city-based  operation control (machines/methods/ways); (iii) Lack of 
 (serious thought/something to think about/respect) of externalities related to land market (popular things/general ways things are going) and city-based  real estate products; (iv) 
 Forever broken-up city-based  shape; (v) (related to what holds something together and makes it strong) weird things in the portion of facilities and 
 public spaces; (vi) Excess (set of machines), without users, for an blurry/unknown period. 
 The resulting (popular things/general ways things are going) of money-based and (money-related) management practices: (i) (not being there; not being present) of 
 (serving to stop something bad before it happens) test of the money-based ability to be done of city-based planning in general, city-based  plans 
 and operations; (ii) Weak or (not there; not present) linking between the city-based budget/investment and the 
 city-based land-based management plans; (iii) (existence of two things that aren't equal in size, power, color, etc.) between the structure of the city-based 
 accounting (POCAL) and the structure of the land-based/sectoral management system for city-based 
 development, making (money-related)/budgetary control and management harder; (iv) Long-lasting 
 money-related shortage, with a (happening in cycles) energetic co-related to local authority orders, (gave a reason to do something) 
 by systematised money-related regulation; (v) (problems, delays, etc.) of budget taking aimed at the 
 development of the city-based  space, in competition with other parts/areas involving city-based activity, 
 in the (money-related) distribution of activity plans and the city-based budget. 
 The resulting (popular things/general ways things are going) for externalities: (i) Spoiling of urbanisation and construction; (ii)

 What went wrong and why - an summary 
 Given the stated habits/desires, let us now finally decide something from what has failed, trying to 
 identify probable explanations, especially when dealing with habits/desires disagreeing to the 
 supposed goals of the SM public policies and the formal TM system. So, the following 
 have failed: (i) the SM and (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) (the ability to keep something around, or keep something going) policies, in the management of the city-based 
 21 
 
 space where breaking (up) and (related to what holds something together and makes it strong) nonsense(unable to speak clearly) have been seen, as well as too much/too many 
 consumption of land and negative (effects on the surrounding conditions or on the health of the Earth), both because the new spaces were 
 not combined and because the (protection of natural things/using less energy, water, etc.) of the combined spaces was neglected, 
 resulting in the later (worsening / rusting, crumbling, etc.) of the city-based  structures and (the health of the Earth/the surrounding conditions) as well as 
 a lack of coordination and (too much of one thing and not enough of another) in together used functions or services; (ii) social policies 
 (related to/looking at/thinking about) housing and services to the community since the easily-broken quality of city-based  development 
 control left certain (agreeing with, or related to, the Constitution) (promises that something will definitely happen or that something will definitely work as described) (able to be hurt) such as the right to housing since access 
 to this was made hard  or impossible for the population due to high prices and often 
 not enough localisation; health and education since good taking for the (pertaining to each person or thing) 
 facilities as it was, with the right ability (to hold or do something) and at the right moments, was made harder; the 
 right (surrounding conditions) and quality of city-based  life faced with a upsetting "work site atmosphere" 
 and (worsening / rusting, crumbling, etc.) of the (where there are lots of homes) and working spaces; (iii) the money-based and (money-related) policies 
 built-in to city-based  development, this way creating (constant/not going away) or (happening in cycles) situations of both 
 functional and money-related deseconomy and even that of (money-related) non-(the ability to keep something around, or keep something going). 
 The basic reasons that we have ended/decided to be at the basis of these performance 
 failures in the TM system may be summarised as follows: (i) Belief by the legal/law-based authority 
 that urbanisation can be done/tried through land-based management (tools or objects used to do work or measure something) (TMI) when, 
 in fact, it is mostly begun/tried by direct city-based  operation without prior city-based  programming; 
 (ii) Reduced use of TMI in detail and in terms of an operating programme, since it is believed 
 that the city-based master plans will be (good) enough, without a plan including a (serving to stop something bad before it happens) and 
 possible/likely element and without a programme which thinks about/believes management ways of doing things and 
 control of the city-based  growth process; (iii) (even though there is the existence of) the TM system beginning and building on and difficult project 
 regular test of the state of the (land area owned or controlled by someone) and the system pointing to/showing execution of plans, 
 this has rarely happened. On the other hand, there is a famous lack of critical test 
 (related to/looking at/thinking about) the performance of the TM system itself, especially where the complex difficulty of city-based 
 systems needs/demands (producing more with less waste) management, in the cities. 
 However, based on the same public policies and the same TM system, cases have been 
 watched/followed which show (based on what's seen or what seems obvious) positive results and which have become reference examples, 
 maybe as a result of best land-based management practices but also counting on the help of 
 good/willing facts or conditions (that surround someone), which (shows or proves) that the formal system is, in fact, (able to be harmed by) 
 personal plans or attitudes of the actors, that is, it needs to be complemented with a safe 
 guide which reduces the margin of randomness and error in land-based management practices. 
 
 The state of (related to space or existing in space) planning at the local level 
 In the tradition of city-based  management and planning practices, the plans have been limited, 
 in general, to a classification of action and qualification of the city-based  land, followed by the policy 
 action of use and occupation of land according to city-based  limits/guidelines established in the MDP, 
 not proposing procedures involving planned programming of city-based  development as well as 
 controlled and (serving to stop something bad before it happens) watching in the carrying out of this. 
 On the other hand, although the described/explained planning translates into more real and 
 goal city-based  proposals, enabling prior (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) test and public participation,

 the typical delay and its required format leads to its rejection most of the time, which gives 
 it with an not mirror-images or even rare character. It tends to be adopted only to fit in with the
