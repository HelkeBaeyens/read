 Abstract 
 An econometric procedure for guessing Arrow-Pratt coefficients of risk disgust is received/made from. The model of farmers giving-out land 
 among different crops, and time between fun and labor, allows for testing Arrow's guesses of decreasing total risk disgust and 
 increasing relative risk disgust. The scientific results support these guesses. Â© 1997 Elsevier Science B.V. 
 
 1. Introduction 
 
 The important works of Arrow (1971) and Pratt 
 (1964) established that under the expected-utility 
 guess there exist one-to-one relationships between preferences over random income or wealth 
 and the measures of risk disgust. Since then, the 
 different measures of risk disgust have played a 
 central role in deciding/figuring out (serving to compare two or more things) static results 
 of behavior under doubt (i.e., Sandmo, 1971; 
 Just and Zilberman, 1983). Especially, specific 
 ideas (you think are true) (related to/looking at/thinking about) the signs, high levels, and 
 behaviors with respect to wealth changes of the 
 measures are needed/demanded. Commonly, possible studies assume positive measures of risk disgust and 
 adopt Arrow's guesses on the effect of wealth on 
 the measures of risk disgust (in other words), decreasing total and increasing relative risk disgust. 
 While there exists some evidence on the 
 signs and high levels of these measures there is a 
 little evidence on the effect of wealth

 changes on them. So, the goal of this study is 
 two-fold: (i) guessing the (many, many times more/much, much less)s of 
 the measures of risk disgust; (ii) guessing the 
 effects of wealth changes on the measures, by that/in that way 
 testing Arrow's guesses about their behavior with 
 respect to income or wealth. It is worthwhile to note 
 that such scientific results are of special importance 
 to the farming-based part/area. Farming-based production is 
 seen as (large/relatively large) risk and significant 
 governmental helping action and so group measures of risk disgust and their properties with respect to wealth have very important policy effects/results/suggestions. 
 The Â·literature has tried to provide scientific 
 (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) of people' risk attitudes. These attempts may be classified into two main approaches: 
 experimental and econometric. A critical difference 
 between them is that the former is based on tests in which people are presented with possible lists of questions (related to/looking at/thinking about) risky other choices, 
 with or without real payments, while the last thing just mentioned has 
 the advantage of being based on people' actual 
 decisions. The experimental approach, for example, 
 has been used by Dillon and Scandizzo (1978) to

 bring out risk attitudes of survival/income farmers in northeast Brazil, and by Binswanger (1980), Binswanger 
 (1981) and Quizon et al. (1984) to carefully study a fairly 
 large-scale experiment, with real significant payments, in (away from cities) India. 
 The econometric approach has been used in variety of facts or conditions (that surround someone). Moscardi and de Janvry (1977), 
 and Shahabuddin et al. (1986) used such an approach 
 in which the decision-makers were assumed to follow a safety-first rule. Antle (1987, 1989), Poetsley 
 and Harris (1987), Love and Buccola (1991), Pope 
 and Just (1991), and Saha et al. (1994) used econometric approaches to study of risk attitudes of decision-makers assuming expected utility (biggest increase/best possible extent). 
 Newbery and Stiglitz (1981), Robison (1982), Pope 
 (1982), Hazell (1982) and Binswanger (1982) present a complete discussion of the (connected/related) books. 
 The papers by Pope and Just, Poetsley and Harris, and Saba are the closest to this one. Pope and 
 Just developed tests for telling the difference between constant total, relative, and partial risk disgust. In 
 contrast, they did not think about/believe an ability to stretch of risk 
 disgust and so did not guess a planned way 
 in which risk disgust differs among people. 
 Hence, the clearly stated/particular guesses of Pope and Just are 
 special cases of the general model of this paper. In 
 Section 6 we compare our results to others including 
 Poetsley and Harris, and Saba. 
 A large body of (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) against the expected 
 utility guess has been piling up over past 
 20 years (i.e., Kahneman and Tversky, 1979; 
 Machina, 1987), raising some doubts as to the importance of the (before that/before now) talked about/said measures. Most of 
 the violations of the expected utility guess, 
 however, have been received with carefully planned 
 experiments. So, it is unclear whether such violations should prohibit the use of the expected utility 
 guess when studying real-world decisions. (not very long ago), Bar-Shira (1992) could find no violations of 
 the expected utility guess in production decisions of Israeli farmers. Rubinstein (1988) points to/shows 
 that the expected utility guess is likely to be 
 violated when other choices are almost the same  in the sense 
 that either prizes or chances are unable to be separated among the other choices. Buschena and Zilberman (1992) showed that the expected utility guess is less likely to hold when comparing other choice 
 
 pairs that are highly different in both importance 
 and chance. 1 However, real-life other choices appear to be (compared to other things) almost the same, but able to be separated. 
 This way the expected utility guess is (based on what's seen or what seems obvious) 
 valid for the purpose of this paper. 
 This paper go aheads as follows. Section 1 reviews 
 the (connected/related) books. Section 2 discusses the relationships between the total, relative and partial 
 measures of risk disgust, and possible responses 
 to changes in income or wealth under each. Section 3 
 outlines the model and gets some ends/end results on 
 the effect of risk on production. Section 4 gives 
 scientific background and describes the data. In Section 5, the guess procedure is organized and listed. Section 
 6 presents the results and compares them to results 
 which have been received in other studies. Then 
 ends/end results are presented. 
 
 2. Measures of risk disgust: properties and relationships 
 Arrow and Pratt first introduced the measure of 
 total risk disgust 
 (1) 
 A(W) 
 U"(W)jU'(W), 
 where W points to/shows total wealth and U" and U' 
 point to/show the second and first derivatives of the von 
 Neumann-Morgenstern utility function, (match up each pair of items in order). 
 The measure of total risk disgust is appropriate 
 to describe situations in which total wealth has a 
 fixed (random/including random data points) part-income, and a (number or thing that changes) nonstochastic part-initial wealth. Arrow pointed out 
 that gut feeling hints that an person's desire 
 to begin/try a certain risky project is greater when 
 hejshe is richer. In other words, richer people should have more risky valuable things 
 in their (mix of stocks, bonds, etc./document collection). So, the measure of total risk 
 disgust should decrease with wealth. 
 As it wasations where both the (random/including random data points) and nonstochastic parts/pieces of the wealth are changing 
 (fair in amount, related to something else/properly sized compared to something else)ly, the appropriate measure IS relative 
 risk disgust, 
 (2) 
 R(W)= -(U"(W)jU'(W))W. 
 Arrow's guess is that when both initial wealth 
 and the risky project are increased by the same 
 
 =- 
 
 1 Both prizes and chances of the lotteries in one pair are 
 very different from those of the lotteries in the other pair. 
 
 Z. Bar-Shira et al. I Farming-based Money flow 17 (1997) 211-222 
 
 proportion, the person's desire to begin/try 
 the risky project is smaller. In other words, richer 
 people should hold a smaller proportion of risky 
 valuable things in their (mix of stocks, bonds, etc./document collection). The (intelligent/obvious) guess of 
 increasing relative risk disgust is also supported 
 mathematically. Assuming bounded utility 
 functions, 2 Arrow showed that the measure of relative risk disgust must be greater than togetherness for 
 randomly large wealth, and less than togetherness for randomly small wealth. 3 So, a continuous boring voice 
 measure of relative risk disgust must be increasing 
 with wealth and must be equal to one for some 
 wealth between zero and infinity. 
 A third measure of risk disgust is the measure of 
 partial risk disgust (Menezes and Hanson, 1970; 
 Zeckhauser and Keeler, 1970), 
 P ( W0 , 1r) 
 U" ( W0 + 1r) / U' ( W0 + 1r)) 1r, 
 
 =- ( 
 
 (3) 
 where W0 represents nonstochastic initial wealth and 7T 
 represents (random/including random data points) income. Like the measure of relative risk disgust, this measure is unitless. The measure of partial risk disgust is appropriate to describe 
 situations in which initial wealth is fixed and income 
 is (number or thing that changes). 
 The behavior of the measure of partial risk disgust under wealth changes or risky income changes 
 can be shown to be figured out by/decided by the measures of 
 total and relative risk disgust when the measure 
 of relative risk disgust is increasing with wealth. 
 The measure of partial risk disgust is related to the 
 measure of total risk disgust as follows: 
 
 (4) 
 (making different) both sides with respect to W0 gives 
 
 ap 
 - 
 
 awo 
 
 =A'1r. 
 
 (5) 
 
 Hence, decreasing total risk disgust hints decreasing partial risk disgust with respect to initial 
 wealth. The measure of partial risk disgust is related to the measure of relative risk disgust by 
 
 ( 6) 
 
 2 The bounded utility idea (you think is true) is (good) enough to eliminate what 
 is known as the St. Petersburg weird statement (Laffont, 1989, pp. 7-8). 
 3 To see this, represent relative risk as R, and then (combine different things together so they work as one unit) twice 
 the expression U" I U' &amp;gt; - RW. 
 
 (making different) both sides with respect to

 Wo + 7T 
 ( Wa + 7T)

 yields 
 
 (7) 
 
 Hence increasing relative risk disgust hints increasing partial risk disgust with respect to 7T. The 
 opposite, however, does not hold. One may have 
 increasing partial risk disgust with respect to 7T and 
 decreasing relative risk disgust at the same time. 
 The above discussion shows that information about the behavior of the measures of total and 
 relative risk disgust (when the last thing just mentioned is increasing) 
 is (good) enough to decide/figure out the behavior of the measure 
 of partial risk disgust, but not the opposite (BarShira, 1991). We now show that the ability to stretch of the 
 measure of total risk disgust with respect to 
 wealth decides/figures out the behavior of both measures of 
 total and relative risk disgust. The ability to stretch of 
 the measure of total risk disgust with respect to 
 wealth is defined as 
 E&#126; 
 
 w 
 
 =A'-. 
 
 (8) 
 
 A 
 Assuming risk disgust, this ability to stretch is negative 
 (zero, positive) when the measure of total risk 
 disgust is decreasing (constant, increasing). Also, because R' =A' W +A &amp;gt; 0 if and only if E,r' &amp;gt; 
 -1, the measure of relative risk disgust is increasing (decreasing) when the ability to stretch of total risk 
 disgust is greater (smaller) than minus one. It follows that 0 &amp;gt; E,r' &amp;gt; - 1 is equal to decreasing 
 total risk disgust and increasing relative risk 
 disgust. Note, that E,r' = -1 is equal to R' = 
 A' W +A = 0, or in words, constant relative risk 
 disgust. The analysis in this section shows that the 
 ability to stretch of the measure of total risk disgust 
 with respect to wealth decides/figures out the behavior of all 
 three measures of risk disgust. 
 
 3. Way(s) of doing things 
 The model presented below describes the following farming situation on an Israeli Moshav: I small 
 farm owners, who form a village, set apart a fixed 
 amounts of land L among farming-based activities, 
 each &#126;aving net return 7Tj; and a fixed amount of 
 time T among fun T 1 and farm work. The technology is assumed to show constant returns to scale 
 
 Z. Bar-Shira et al.j Farming-based Money flow 17 (1997) 211-222 
 
 214 
 
 with fixed proportions production. The constant-returns-to-scale idea (you think is true) is thought of as (compared to other things) 
 harmless for this paper because the total 
 farm scale is constant in the sample relating to/connected to 
 both time and land. It follows that increasing one 
 activity must be with a decrease in another activity, leading to (giving out things in a different way) of all inputs, 
 including managerial input. So, the increase in size 
 of some activities can be (accomplished or gained) without the loss 
 of (wasting very little while working or producing something) usually caused by increasing all inputs 
 except the managerial input. The technology idea (you think is true) is further gave a reason for by Just et al. (1990). 
 What's more, labor is also a rare/not enough  input because 
 hired labor is not available and all labor input to the 
 farm has to be supplied by the owner and his family. 
 In this study the (not being there; not being present) of a labor market is due to 
 the fact that farmers exactly follow the way of thinking/basic truth/rule of self-employment. 4 The (not being there; not being present) of a labor market focuses on the importance of time portion between 
 fun and farming-based activities in the decision process. 
 Farmers get utility from both money-based wealth 
 and fun, so that their unemotional function is a 
 two-argument utility function. By choosing different 
 land portions, the farmers are choosing different 
 lotteries. In this sense the farmer's problem is the 
 same as the (person or business who gives money to help start a business)'s problem, the last thing just mentioned having to 
 decide on an valuable thing (mix of stocks, bonds, etc./document collection). Each farmer is assumed 
 to act as an expected utility (make as big as possible)r, and his 
 decision problem can be written as 
 maxE[U(W,T 1)]_) 
 L,T 1 
 
 = maxE[ U(W0 + 7T'L;T 1)]_)

 where L is a vector of the land amounts gave out to

 which define a Moshav, which is an farming-based settlement in 
 Israel (for more details see Zusman (1988)). 
 
 is a vector whose typical element &#126; is the time 
 needed/demanded to help grow one unit of land planted with 
 crop j, and E is the expectation over the distribution 
 of (money made/good things received). The first restriction (Eq. (9.a)) is the time 
 restriction reflecting that the total amount of available time minus time spent on farm activities is 
 equal to time gave/reserved to fun. The second restriction (Eq. (9.b)) is the ability (to hold or do something) restriction pointing to/showing 
 that total (helped to grow) land can not go beyond the total 
 amount of available land. 5 
 Substituting the time restriction (Eq. (9.a)) into 
 the unemotional function (Eq. (9)) and assuming that the 
 ability (to hold or do something) restriction (Eq. (9.b)) is not binding, 6 the 
 first-order conditions are 
 aE[U] 
 aL =E[7TÂ· Uw] -E[TÂ· UT1] =0 
 
 (10) 
 
 where Uw and UT 1 are the partial derivatives with 
 respect to wealth and fun, (match up each pair of items in order). 
 The (understanding/ explanation) of the first-order condition is 
 plain/honest/easy: one more unit of time gave out to 
 either fun or one of the crops will create, on 
 average, the same utility increase. So, without a labor market, the cost of labor is figured out by/decided by its opportunity cost in terms of fun. In 
 addition, the cost of labor is endogenous to the 
 decision-maker, and so the best production 
 big plan/layout/dishonest plan is different from the best decision when 
 the cost of labor is (coming from the outside of something) (as in a situation 
 where hired labor is available). 
 Another factor that affects the best decision is 
 risk. Following Sandmo (1971), it can be shown that 
 (7T/&#126;) Â· Uw &amp;gt; UT1 for a (not wanting to do anything dangerous) individual (A &amp;gt; 
 0). So, in the case of decreasing not important utility 
 from fun, the individual uses/eats more fun 
 under doubt than under sure feeling. What's more, 
 in this model under sure feeling, the individual grows 
 only one crop, the crop for which the (money made/good thing received) per unit 
 of time is highest value, and fun is ate/destroyed to the 
 point where its not important utility is equal to the 
 not important utility from one more unit of time gave out 
 
 5 Note that this decision problem is static in nature. Generalizing this (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) following the energetic model of farming-based 
 decision making under risk of Hertzler (1991) would also be 
 desirable but is beyond the extent of/the range of this paper. 
 6 Note that in this study, watched/followed land portions sum to less 
 than total land available on the farm. 
 
 Z. Bar-Shira et al. /Agricultural Money flow 17 ( 1997) 211-222 
 
 to the chosen crop. Under doubt, however, the 
 farmer grows more than one crop, and fun is 
 ate/destroyed to the point where its not important utility is 
 less than the not important utility from the lowest (money made/good thing received) 
 per unit of time. So, it appears that (not wanting to do anything dangerous) 
 farmers (branch out into different things) risks by choosing a crop (mix of stocks, bonds, etc./document collection). 
 This has led (people who work to find information) to model the choice of crop 
 (mix of stocks, bonds, etc./document collection) in the same (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) as choice of an 
 valuable thing (mix of stocks, bonds, etc./document collection). Generally, the approach is to find the 
 (producing a lot with very little waste) edge of something/unexplored area in the mean-variance plane by 
 quadratic programming, and then to figure out the importance of the risk-disgust coefficient from the slope 
 of the edge of something/unexplored area at the chosen point. The econometric 
 guess approach has the advantage of plain/honest/easy guesses testing. 
 A Taylor series (act of something getting bigger, wider, etc.) of Uw around expected 
 wealth, W = W0 + 1T' L (where 1T = E[ 7T ]_)), for nonrandom fun yields 
 
 Uw

 Now let the measure of total risk disgust, A, 
 change/differ  with W 
 
 A=- 
 
 u&#126;,w =A(W). 
 
 The functional form, A= a W.B, is (good or well enough) flexible to change something (to help someone)/take care of someone either risk-looking (for) or (not wanting to do anything dangerous) 
 behavior-a greater than (smaller than) zero hints 
 risk disgust (risk looking (for)). Further, it does not 
 restrict the sign of the ability to stretch of total risk 
 disgust with respect to W, given by 
 
 ( 14) 
 As (showed/shown or proved) above, f3 decides/figures out the behavior 
 of the three measures of risk disgust discussed 
 above with respect to changes in wealth. Substituting 
 the functional form for the measure of total risk 
 disgust into the first order conditions gives 
 (15) 
 which, after some math-related (moving around/misleading and dishonest behaviors), can be 
 written as

 where cp is the covariance matrix_!!f net (money made/good things received) from

 the different crops. The term T-=- represents the 
 Uw 
 
 understood cost of labor per unit of land. 7 The understood 
 cost of labor reflects the opportunity cost of time in 
 terms of fun, translated to money-based worth by the 
 tax rate of substitution between fun and 
 money. In this form, the first-order conditions parallel the usual bestity conditions under doubt, 
 where (money made/good things received) minus costs are equaled the risk 
 higher cost.

 Since L is watched/followed directly and cp and 1T bar can

 W 0 and T. Under the permanent income guess 
 of Friedman, the people' consumption and hence 
 saving is (fair in amount, related to/properly sized, related to) permanent income. As a 
 consequence, the first wealth at each time point is

 where ci is the ith (typical and expected) and 1/Ji is the 
 corresponding coefficient. Note that the farmer's 
 (features/ qualities/ traits) reflect differences in the farmer's ability (i.e., the time needed/demanded to help grow one unit of 
 land). Replacing J.L with the linear combination of

 4. Scientific background and data 
 The way(s) of doing things presented in the previous section is used in this section to guess the risk 
 attitudes of individual farmers of the same age group 
 in southern Israel. Data were collected by the accounting office of Moshav Bin-Yahav. This cooperative settlement is located in the Arava area of 
 Israel. The Arava includes the plains between 
 the Red Sea and the Dead Sea. It is an dry area 
 with low minimum and high maximum temperatures, 
 making it an off-season producer of vegetables for 
 local and export markets. Other than a handful of 
 added/more settlements, the Arava area is poorly 
 populated. Each farm on the moshav is privately 
 controlled, and its money-based life depends on its 
 
 a money-making state. Output marketing and input buying 
 are done cooperatively because of scale advantages. 
 The moshav members accept the ways of thinking/basic truths/rules of selfemployment and back and forth/equal between people cooperation as their idea-based basis. The social behavioral normal behaviors in this 
 kind of settlement are very strict. New candidates 
 for membership have to meet these normal behaviors and the 
 majority of the members have to approve their entry. The strictness of these rules leads to a 
 (group of things that are all pretty much the same) population in terms of preferences. 
 Hence it is reasonable to think about  the differences in 
 preferences as a secondary (and differences in wealth 
 as the first (or most important)) factor affecting risk (point of view/way of behaving). 
 The data set has two parts. The first contains 
 (how money affects people's lives) (numbers that change/things that change) in the following order: care, care with money, management, experience, (husband or wife) work, 
 farming-based knowledge, (desire to do something/reason for doing something), land quality, education, and risk-looking (for) (point of view/way of behaving). These (numbers that change/things that change) 
 describing farmer (features/ qualities/ traits) were built by 
 means of a Delphi panel got together from among the 
 moshav leaders and farm advisors. The (numbers that change/things that change) are 
 rated from one to five and represent the agreement of 
 the panel. The higher the number, the better the 
 attribute, for example the better the management 
 ability, the higher the land quality, or the greater the 
 (related to a husband or wife) (thing that's given/work that's done). The second part of the data set 
 contains a thin slice time series sample on 101 
 farmers over 10 years (1973-1982). It contains grouped (numbers that change/things that change) consisting of total water use, total 
 water cost, and expense on other inputs such as 
 bug-killers, (material that makes plants grow better)s, and helping grow materials. The 
 dry conditions and the remoteness of any outside 
 water source make water the most critical input. 
 So, drip crop-watering/rinsing with water, a very (producing a lot with very little waste) way of using 
 water, is the most in control/most common technology. Disaggregated 
 data on (helped to grow) land, yield, and money/money income are available by crop for bell peppers, tomatoes, onions, 
 eggplant, and melons. Almost all farmers grow tomatoes, bell peppers and melons. A smaller number 
 also grow eggplant and onions. The accounting office, in most cases, does not record input expense 
 by crop, but it does record total input expense. 
 One can use a behavior expertic approach to recover the 
 input expense per crop (Just et al., 1990), and 
 then to recover the (money made/good thing received) for each crop per unit of 
 land. Two main factors cause the opportunity cost of 
 land to be zero. First, there is no market for land 
 because the land is owned by the government, and

 The decision process is based on (not definite) expectations of future (money made/good thing received), as well as on expected 
 variance of future (money made/good thing received). Future (money made/good thing received) expectations 
 are assumed to be based on previous years' (money made/good things received). 
 Since no farmer grows every crop every year some 
 values are missing. A farmer who has such missing 
 values is assumed to form perceptions of (money made/good thing received) for 
 those years based on farms which are just like 
 his jher own in terms of size, location, and owner 
 wealth. These missing values are guessed by moving backward (money made/good thing received) on year and farmer dummies. That is

 Future (money made/good thing received) expectations in an (surrounding conditions) 
 which is Markovian up to white noise tend to be 
 (able to change and get better) in nature (see Just, 1977). 8 So, farmer's 
 expectations can be guessed by a weighted average 
 of actual (money made/good thing received) (or its (statement about the future) when the actual 
 value is missing) over past years, where the coefficients sum to one and decline at a geometric rate (for 
 more on the bestity of this procedure see Just, 
 1977). Following Berhman (1968), the actual guess was based on only the past 3 years' (money made/good thing received), 
 because most of the explanatory power is in the 
 (money made/good thing received) of the last few years, and because of not enough data. Adapting Just (1974), the guessed expected (money made/good thing received) for farmer i at time t is

 A simple grid search may be used to identify the 
 maximum chance guess of (). 
 The endogenous (number or thing that changes) L appears on both sides 
 of Eq. (21), suggesting a (happening at the same time) problem. To 
 resolve it, we used a two-stage instrumental changeable 
 approach. The (tools or objects used to do work or measure something) were the first and second 
 moments of the profit distribution function, (in other words), the 
 means and the parts/pieces of the variance matrix 
 (20 (numbers that change/things that change)). Because there is no part of the 
 variance matrix on the right-hand side of Eq. (21), 
 the equation is identified. 
 The first stage involves an instrumental logit 
 model. That is,

 covariance of crop i and crop j. We use t e mmlmum chi-square method to guess this logit model 
 (Maddala, 1983). Specifically, we (made small) the 
 weighted sum of squared errors where the weights 
 were (LskS 1 )t. As a result, the resulting guesses 
 are best linear fair guesses. Note that Eq. (27) 
 completely/in a hinting way assumes that the decision process is a 
 (one after the other) one: in the first step the farmer decides on 
 total amount of land to be helped grow; in the next he 
 decides on the portion of (helped to grow) land among 
 the five crops. The second stage involves replacing 
 the land portions on the right-hand side of Eq. 
 (21) by their (described the future) values received/got from the 
 instrumentallogit model. 
 
 218 
 
 Z. Bar-Shira et al.j Farming-based Money flow 17 ( 1997) 211-222 
 
 Finally, before going ahead to guess, we think about/believe possible difference/different version in risk (point of view/way of behaving) cross people. Following previous studies (Dillon and Scandizzo, 1978; Moscardi and de Janvry, 1977; Binswanger, 1980, 1981, 1982; Shahabuddin et al., 1986) 
 concerning bring outation of risk attitudes, we related 
 difference/different version in risk (point of view/way of behaving) to difference/different version in (how money affects people's lives) (features/ qualities/ traits) among people. Specifically, we replace the limit/guideline a in Eq. (21) by a 
 linear combination of the (features/ qualities/ traits). This allows 
 high levels of the measures of risk hatred of change/differ 
 across people but keeps the ability to stretch of total 
 risk disgust, 3{, constant. This way the guessed value 
 for f3 should be understood/explained as an guess of group ability to stretch. The extent to which the guess of 
 constant ability to stretch is believable depends on the scientific background. 
 
 6. The results 
 The ratio Sk / S1 is expected to increase in m k 
 and decrease in m 1 because the higher the (money made/good thing received) of a 
 crop, the greater the amount of land gave out to it. 
 This ratio is also expected to decrease in vkk and 
 increase in v 11 because for (not wanting to do anything dangerous) people 
 the higher the variance of a crop, the smaller the 
 amount of land gave out to it. Table 1 shows the 
 results of the four instrumentallogit (moving backwards). Out 
 of 16 signs, only one has a significant opposite sign.

 Table 2 gives the moving backward results of Eq. (21). 
 The first and most important finding is that the 
 ability to stretch of the measure of total risk disgust is 
 -0.316. The connected T-ratio shows that it is 
 very different from zero as well as from 1. 
 This way we accept the guesses of decreasing total risk disgust and increasing relative risk disgust over the simple other choice of constant total 
 risk disgust or constant relative risk disgust. The 
 received/made from behavior of the measure of partial risk disgust is plain/honest/easy: it increases with income and 
 decreases with wealth. The results reported in Table 
 2 were gotten for r = 0.04 which was the real 
 interest rate during the watched/followed time, and by assigning the not important natural tendency to save, b, a value of 
 0.2. This value was proven true by the moshav leaders 
 as being realistic. What's more, we (did/done/completed) a sensitivity analysis to (check for truth/prove true) how strong the results were 
 to changes in the not important natural tendency to save. Table 
 3 shows the guessed values of ln a and f3 for 
 different values of b. For b = 0.10 the guessed 
 values for Ina and f3 were -10.51 and -0.37, 
 (match up each pair of items in order). For b = 0.30 the guessed values for 
 ln a and f3 were - 11.62 and - 0.29, (match up each pair of items in order).

 So, the guesses for ln a and f3 appear to be 
 strong to changes in b, (in other words), the received/made from (not numbers-based) 
 ends/end results on the behavior of the measures of risk 
 disgust with respect to wealth or income changes 
 are the same. 
 It is interesting to compare our results to those of 
 others. A plain/honest/easy comparison is possible with 
 Binswanger (1981), whose guess of the ability to stretch of the measure of total risk disgust with 
 respect to wealth was - 0.32. This is extremely close 
 to our finding. A less plain/honest/easy comparison is 
 possible with Poetsley and Harris, who reported 
 results for three different zones. Their guesses of 
 the ability to stretch of the measure of partial risk disgust 
 with respect to income and wealth were in the ranges 
 of 0.129 to 0.194, and -0.312 to -0.642, (match up each pair of items in order). One can easily (check for truth/prove true) that the following relaW 
 tionships hold: (a) E&#126; = E4-o, that is, the elastica 
 
 W 
 
 ity of the measure of partial risk disgust with 
 respect to initial wealth is equal to the ability to stretch of 
 the measure of total risk disgust with respect to 
 wealth multiplied by the share of nonstochastic 
 
 E: = E4-w + 1, that is, 
 1T 
 
 wealth in total wealth; (b) 
 
 the ability to stretch of the measure of partial risk disgust 
 with respect to the random income is equal to the 
 ability to stretch of the measure of total risk disgust 
 with respect to wealth times the share of the random 
 income in total wealth plus 1. So, our finding that 
 the ability to stretch of the measure of total risk disgust 
 is equal to - 0.316 is equal to elasticities of the 
 measure of partial risk disgust with respect to initial 
 wealth and random income of -0.19 and 0.95, 
 (match up each pair of items in order). 9 Whereas Poetsley and Harris' results 
 are agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with ours (not numbers-based), the importance 
 of their guessed ability to stretch of the measure of partial 
 
 9 Note that, as reported below, the share of initial wealth in 
 total wealth is 0.8 at the middle-point points.

 risk disgust with respect to random income appears 
 to be much lower than ours. 
 The guessed effects of farmer (features/ qualities/ traits) on 
 risk disgust are described/explained in the central part of Table 
 2. The most significant (features/ qualities/ traits) are care, 
 management, experience and education. Famously, 
 farmers with a higher level of experience as well as 
 farmers with better managerial abilities show a 
 lower degree of risk disgust. The gut feeling is simple. Risk is a complicating factor which farmers with 
 less experience or less managerial ability try to 
 avoid. Higher levels of education are related to 
 higher risk disgust, suggesting that educated farmers understand better how to avoid risk. Care is 
 also connected with higher risk disgust. A possible 
 explanation might be that farmers who work harder 
 can reduce ex-post risk and so appear (not wanting to do anything dangerous) 
 ex-ante. 
 The effects of farmer (features/ qualities/ traits) on the understood cost of labor (bottom part of Table 2) can be 
 divided into direct and indirect effects. The direct 
 effect is due to the hit/effect of the (features/ qualities/ traits) on 
 the time needed/demanded to help grow one unit of land. The 
 indirect effect comes through the tax rate of 
 substitution between fun and money. When less 
 time is loyal to/is dedicated to farm activities, more time is 
 loyal to fun so the tax rate of substitution 
 goes down. Because of this both effects work in the same 
 direction. Care, farming-based knowledge and, to a 
 lesser extent, education are expected to have positive 
 coefficients because they are likely to reduce the 
 time needed/demanded to help grow one unit of land. Care with money 
 should have a positive coefficient because money-saving 
 people tend to waste less time (or to save more 
 time). When land quality and labor are substitute 
 factors, the land quality is also expected to have a 
 positive coefficient. The cost of labor may increase 
 with management and experience: people who work 
 harder and longer may get higher produces and hence 
 be showed as having higher management ability and experience. 
 Statistics describing the three coefficients of risk 
 disgust, initial wealth, expected (money made/good thing received), expected 
 wealth, and the understood costs of labor for the five 
 crops are reported in Table 4. A complete illustration 
 of the distributions of initial wealth, the measure of 
 partial risk disgust, and the understood cost of labor is 
 given by their guessed scientific densities, showed

 in Figs. 1-3, (match up each pair of items in order). The middle-points of expected 
 and initial wealth are US$139,000 and US$107,000, 
 (match up each pair of items in order). These values are close to reality. The 
 middle-point coefficient of total risk disgust is 
 0.0000044. The middle-point coefficient of relative risk 
 disgust is 0.615. The middle-point coefficient of partial 
 risk disgust is 0.117. For comparison, Saha et al. 
 (1994) guessed the measure of relative risk disgust for Kansas wheat farmers to be 5.4 and Antle 
 ( 1987) guessed the measure of partial risk disgust 
 of Indian farmers to be in the range of 0.19 to 1.77. 
 Binswanger reported almost the same  results: his guessed 
 measure of partial risk disgust was between 0.32 
 and 1.72 for most of the people. Antle 
 (1989) re-confirmed his 1987 findings by reporting a 
 mean partial risk disgust of 1.11 for one village and 
 1.14 for the other. We find the measure of partial 
 risk hatred of be in the range of 0.04 to 0.52. So, 
 our sample of Israeli farmers shows a lower degree 
 of partial risk disgust than that of Indian farmers.

 oo 
 
 Poetsley and Harris found the measure of partial risk 
 disgust at the middle-point point to be 0.072, 0.099, and 
 0.696, for their three different zones of Australia. 
 Hence, in two of the zones, Australian farmers showed lower degrees of partial risk disgust than 
 Israeli farmers, whereas in the third zone the degree 
 of partial risk disgust was just like that of the 
 Indian farmers. Our guessed measure of relative 
 risk disgust has a middle-point value of 0.615. Peppers 
 are given out/set aside the highest labor cost, with a middle-point of 
 US$1172 followed by tomatoes with a middle-point of 
 US$929, onions with a middle-point of US$649, melons 
 with a middle-point of US$303, and eggplant with a 
 middle-point of US$236. These results are compatible 
 with reality, where peppers and tomatoes are highlabor crops, and eggplant and melons are low-labor 
 crops. 
 To confirm our results, we note that total wealth 
 is positively related to the risk-looking (for) attitude 
 (number or thing that changes) built by the Delphi panel (with a 
 relationship-related coefficient of 0.46). The main judging requirement 
 guiding the Delphi panel members in testing the 
 risk-looking (for) attribute was the farmer desire to 
 adopt new technology such as a new variety, bug-killer, (material that makes plants grow better), etc. This positive relationship means 
 that the richer the farmer, the less (not wanting to do anything dangerous) he is.

 decreasing total risk disgust presented above. 
 
 7. Summary and ends/end results 
 This paper develops a way(s) of doing things to test the 
 effect of wealth changes on the measures of total, 
 relative, and partial risk disgust. The behavior of all 
 three measures were shown to be figured out by/decided by a 
 single limit/guideline, the ability to stretch of total risk disgust with respect to wealth. (related to/looking at/thinking about) Israeli farmers, our main findings were that the measure of 
 total risk disgust decreases with wealth, the 
 measure of relative risk disgust increases with 
 wealth, and the measure of partial risk disgust 
 increases in risky income and decreases with nonstochastic initial wealth. These studies suggest evidence supporting Arrow's guesses. 10
