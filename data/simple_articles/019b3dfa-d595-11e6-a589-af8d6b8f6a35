Dial "A" for Farming 
 A Review of Information and Communication 
 Technologies for Farming-based Extension in 
 Developing Countries

 Abstract 
 Farming can serve as an important engine for money-based growth in developing countries, yet 
 yields in these countries have fallen behind far behind those in developed countries for 20 years. One 
 possible (machine/method/way) for increasing yields is the use of improved farming-based technologies, such 
 as (material that makes plants grow better)s, seeds and cropping ways of doing things. Public-part/area programs have tried to overcome 
 information-related (blocking things) to (related to computers and science) adoption by providing farming-based extension services. 
 While such programs have been widely criticized for their limited scale, (the ability to keep something around, or keep something going) and hit/effect, 
 the fast spread of mobile phone coverage in developing countries provides a (like nothing else) opportunity 
 to help (related to computers and science) adoption via information and communication technology (ICT)-based 
 extension programs. This article outlines the possible (machines/methods/ways) through which ICT could 
 help farming-based adoption and the put into use of extension services in developing countries. It 
 then reviews existing programs using ICT for farming, labeled by the (machine/method/way) (voice, 
 text, internet and mobile money moves (from one place to another)) and the type of services gave/given. Finally, we identify 
 possible restrictions to such programs in terms of design and putting into use, and end with 
 some recommendations for putting into use field-based research on the hit/effect of these programs on 
 farmers' knowledge, (related to computers and science) adoption and welfare.

 Introduction 
 
 The possible role of farming as an engine for money-based growth has long been recognized 
 (Byerlee, de Janvry and Sadoulet 2009). Yet (even though there is the existence of) the importance of farming for 
 development, farming-based production and yields have fallen behind far behind those in developed 
 countries over the past twenty years. One possible explanation for this spoiling growth in 
 yields is the underutilization of improved farming-based technologies, which has remained 
 (compared to other things) low in developing countries since the 1970s (Figure 1).1 
 Many money-based studies have identified the (things that decide other things) of technology adoption and 
 the possible (blocking things) to it (Feder, Just and Zilberman 1985, Foster and Rosenzweig 1995, 
 Foster and Rosenzweig 2010). While the clearly stated/particular (things that decide other things) of technology adoption 
 depend upon the setting and the technology type, common factors identified in the 
 possible and scientific books include education, wealth, tastes, risk preferences, 
 (completing/matching) inputs and access to information and learning. Of these, the role of 
 not mirror-images and expensive information has received particular attention. 
 Governments and international organizations have tried to overcome some of the 
 perceived information failures related to technology adoption via farming-based extension 
 services, generally defined as the delivery of information inputs to farmers (Anderson and 
 Feder 2007). There were about 500,000 farming-based extension personnel worldwide 
 in 2005, with 95 per cent of these working in public farming-based extension systems 
 (Anderson and Feder 2007). Yet (even though there is the existence of) 20 years of investment in and experience with public 
 extension programs, (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) of their hit/effect upon farming-based knowledge, adoption and 
 working well remains limited. What's more, the systems themselves have been criticized for 
 high costs, problems of scale and low levels of responsibility (Anderson and Feder 2007). 
 The fast spread of information and communication technologies (ICT) in developing 
 countries offers a (like nothing else) opportunity to move (from one place to another) knowledge via private and public 
 information systems. Over the past ten years, mobile phone coverage has spread quickly in 
 Africa, Asia and Latin America: over sixty percent of people/of the group of sub-Saharan Africa, 
 Asia and Latin America had access to mobile phone coverage in 2009. Happening with this 
 increase in mobile phone coverage has been an increase in mobile phone adoption: As of 
 1Low 
 
 levels of adoption do not necessarily point to/show under-adoption, defined as a "situation in which there are 
 
 big unrealized gains to the use of a new technology or (act of something getting bigger, wider, etc.) of input use, and reflected in high 
 returns to adoption" (Foster and Rosenzweig 2010). 
 
 1 
 
 2008, there were about 4 billion mobile phone subscribers worldwide, with 374 
 million subscriptions in Africa, 1.79 million in Asia and 460 million in Latin America (ITU 
 2009). While initial adoption was mostly by richer, city-based  and more educated residents, 
 over the last few years, mobile phones have been adopted by (away from cities) and city-based  (groups of people/animals/things) in some of 
 the world's poorest countries (Aker and Mbiti 2010). 
 Mobile phones reduce (a lot) communication and information costs for the (away from cities) poor. 
 This not only provides new opportunities for (away from cities) farmers to get access to information 
 on farming-based technologies, but also to use ICTs in farming-based extension services. Since 
 2007, there has been a spread of mobile phone-based computer programs and services in the 
 farming-based part/area, providing information on market prices, weather, transport and 
 farming-based ways of doing things via voice, short message service (SMS), radio and internet. While such 
 programs are new and interesting, they are not without challenges, and it is not yet clear that they will 
 substitute for existing farming-based extension systems. What's more, evidence on 
 their hit/effect remains limited. In order to measure the hit/effect of such services on farmers' 
 knowledge, adoption and welfare, as well as their (producing a lot for a given amount of money)ness, difficult/strict/high quality hit/effect 
 tests are needed. 
 The rest of this paper go aheads as follows. Section II provides an summary of the reasons 
 for and hit/effect of farming-based extension programs in developing countries. Section III 
 identifies the possible (machines/methods/ways) through which mobile phones could improve farmers' 
 access to information and farming-based adoption in general, and help the delivery of 
 farming-based extension systems especially. Section IV surveys existing ICT-based 
 farming-based extension programs and identifies possible challenges to such programs in terms 
 of design and putting into use. Section V outlines a (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) for measuring the (proof that one thing definitely causes another) 
 hit/effect of ICT-based farming programs. Section VI ends/decides.

 Technology Adoption and Farming-based Extension 
 2.1. Technology Adoption, Farming and Growth 
 
 The possible role of farming as an engine for money-based development has long been 
 recognized (Byerlee, de Janvry and Sadoulet 2009). Since the important (things that are given/work that's done) of 
 Schultz (1964), Hayami and Ruttan (1971), and Mellor (1998), there has been a large body of 
 possible and scientific books on the potential multiplier effects of farming-based growth 
 on non-farming-based parts/areas (Byerlee, de Janvry and Sadoulet 2009). Cross-country and 
 country-specific econometric (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) have pointed to/showed that GDP growth created in 
 farming can be especially effective in increasing expenses and incomes of the poor 
 (Ligon and Sadoulet 2007, Bravo-Ortega and Lederman 2005, Ravallion and Chen 2007). 
 (even though there is the existence of) the importance of farming for money-based development, farming is yet to 
 perform as an engine of growth in many developing countries - especially in sub-Saharan 
 Africa (Byerlee, de Janvry and Sadoulet 2009). Farming-based yields have only shown small/short 
 increases in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America since the 1960s, (even though there is the existence of) advances in 
 
 2 
 
 agricultural inventions of new things during that time (Masters 2009).2 Also, data on the adoption 
 of improved farming-based technologies paint a picture of low levels of adoption in developing 
 countries, especially sub-Saharan Africa.3 
 The low rates of adoption in developing countries have been well-recorded/supported, and there is 
 (existing all over a large area) possible and scientific books identifying the (things that decide other things) of farming-based 
 technology adoption in different contexts (Feder, Just and Zilberman 1985, Foster and 
 Rosenzweig 1995, Suri honest/appearing soon, Conley and Udry 2010, Duflo, Kremer and Robinson 
 honest/appearing soon).4 While the findings differ according to the technology and big picture, many 
 studies have identified the importance information and learning for the adoption process.5 
 2.2. Information, Farming-based Extension and Technology Adoption 
 The farming-based production function hints that farmers need information on a variety of 
 topics, at a variety of stages, before adopting a new technology. Figure 2 provides a pretty/interesting 
 representation of the farming-based production function, including clear/separate yet nested adoption 
 decisions (de Silva and Ratnadiwakara 2008, Mittal, Gandhi and Tripathi 2010).6 Farmers 
 have different types of information needs during each stage of the process, ranging from 
 weather forecasts, pest attacks, inputs, (producing crops/helping something grow) practices, pest and disease management 
 and prices. 
 
 2 
 
 Masters (2009) notes that national guesses of crop working well hints that cereal grain output per person in 
 
 sub-Saharan Africa now equals that of South Asia. 
 3Technology 
 
 is the "relationship between inputs and outputs" (Foster and Rosenzweig 2010), or the set of 
 
 hardware (physical) and software (ways of doing things) tools that allow for a different mapping of inputs to outputs. 
 Technology adoption is therefore defined as the "use of new tools or ways of doing things that relate inputs to outputs and 
 the portion of inputs" (Foster and Rosenzweig 2010). 
 4Duflo, 
 
 Kremer and Robinson (honest/appearing soon) find that the returns to (material that makes plants grow better) are high in Kenya and suggest that 
 
 (material that makes plants grow better) is under-used. Suri (honest/appearing soon) hints that some farmers with high returns to adopting combination 
 seeds do not adopt, and attributes this in part to poor (set of machines). 
 5Foster 
 
 and Rosenzweig (1995, 2010) develop a model of learning by doing and learning from others, defining 
 
 learning as happening when "new information affects behavior and results in results for an individual that 
 are closer to the (private) best." Learning can therefore reduce doubt about the money-making ability of a new 
 technology, as well as help an individual to get information about how to well manage the new 
 technology. 
 6The 
 
 simplified model identifies six stages: The "pre-planting" stage, within which/by which farmers decide on the crops and 
 
 the portion of land to each crop; the "seeding" stage, within which/by which farmers decide whether to buy seeds or use 
 their own; the "preparing and planting" stage, within which/by which farmers prepare the land using own or hired labor or land 
 preparation machinery; the "growing" stage, which needs/demands decisions about the use of water, (material that makes plants grow better) 
 and bug-killers; the "collecting, packing and storage" stage, which needs/demands decisions about labor for collecting 
 and storage; and the "marketing" stage, within which/by which farmers must decide whether, when and where to sell the 
 valuable thing (de Silva and Ratnadiwakara 2008, Mittal, Gandhi and Tripathi 2010). 
 
 3 
 
 Farmers can get information from some sources, including, among others, their 
 own trying things and from members of their social network. Yet while traditional 
 money-based explanation assumes that information is costless, information is rarely matching or 
 costless in developing countries. This is partly due to the high cost of getting information 
 via traditional means, such as travel, radio or newspaper. As a result, information 
 (left and right sides not matching) can be an important (blocking thing) to farming-based technology adoption in developing 
 countries. 
 Since the 1960s, farming-based extension has been put forward  as a means of reducing the 
 information (left and right sides not matching) related to technology adoption in both developed and developing 
 countries. Usually/mostly, farming-based extension is the "delivery of information inputs to 
 farmers" (Anderson and Feder 2007). The general extension approach uses specialists to 
 provide a range of services to farmers, from technology moves (from one place to another) to advice-giving services and 
 (related to workers in general) development. 7 Sometimes it has also tried to connect (people who work to find information) 
 directly to the farmer in order to make sure that new technologies are better targeted to the 
 clearly stated/particular conditions of farming-based communities. 
 Farming-based extension models can take a few forms.8 The most common approaches are 
 Training and Visit (T&amp;V), Farmer Field Schools (FFS) and fee-for-service. In the T&amp;V 
 approach, specialists and field staff provide technical information and village visits to 
 selected communities. In many cases the field agents train and work directly with "contact 
 farmers", or farmers who have successfully put into use new technologies and can train 
 others. T&amp;V was (helped increase/showed in a good way) by the World Bank and applied in more than 70 countries 
 between 1975 and 1995 (Anderson, Feder and Ganguly 2006).9 Farmer field schools (FFS) 
 were specifically designed to thinly spread (having different things working together as one unit) pest management (IPM) methods in Asia. 
 FFS also use contact farmers, depending on (related to demanding or permitting the joining of club, group, etc.) training methods that build farmer 
 abilities (to hold or do something). Fee-for-service extension contains both public and private efforts with some 
 public money/giving money (to). In these programs, farmer groups contract extension agents with specific 
 information and service requests.10 
 
 7 
 
 Information gave/given via farming-based extension can include prices, research products and knowledge about 
 
 particular ways of doing things or inputs, such as the strength and timing of (material that makes plants grow better)s. 
 8Agricultural 
 
 extension has expanded in developing countries since the 1960s with significant (government) 
 
 financing. There are about 500,000 farming-based extension workers worldwide, and 80 percent of these are 
 publicly gave money (to) and delivered by government workers (Anderson and Feder 2007). 
 9 
 
 The (without having one central area of command) T&amp;V approach is just like the T&amp;V approach, but the responsibility for delivery is given to 
 
 local governments (Crowder and Anderson 2002). 
 10While 
 
 farming-based extension services are mostly financed and put into use by the (government), the 
 
 information gave/given via such systems is not always a public good. Table 1 shows the different types of 
 information gave/given via extension systems and their classification as either private, public, club or common pool 
 products (that are bought and sold) (Anderson and Feder 2007).

 2.3. Does Farming-based Extension Work? 
 (even though there is the existence of) 20 years of investment in farming-based extension systems, there are surprisingly few 
 difficult/strict/high quality hit/effect tests of these services in developing countries. Table 2 provides an 
 summary of these studies, based upon the type of farming-based extension system (T&amp;V, FFS, 
 fee for service and social networks) and the result (number or thing that changes) of interest (knowledge, 
 adoption, yields, rates of return and general jobs) (Evanson 2001, Anderson and 
 Feder 2007). The results provide disagreeing (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) of the hit/effect of farming-based 
 extension programs.11 
 Do these results suggest that farming-based extension does not work? There are two potential 
 explanations for the mixed results in Table 2. First, there are a few challenges to identifying 
 (one thing is proven to cause something else) between farming-based extension and development results. Measuring 
 the result (numbers that change/things that change) of interest in such studies (e.g., adoption, production and returns) is 
 famously hard, by that/in that way introducing measurement error in the (thing that changes (like a test score) because of something else that you control (like study time)). 
 While this will not introduce lessening bias (the bias toward zero), it can reduce quality, 
 by that/in that way making it harder to detect a (meaningful numbers) effect. What's more, 
 (capable of being seen and known) and unobservable (features/ qualities/ traits) that are (at the same time) related to 
 extension programs and the results of interest will very likely differ across extension and 
 non-extension communities, as well as across users and non-users, which makes the 
 participation status of extension programs endogenous. And finally, given the different types 
 of farming-based extension models (T&amp;V, fee for service, FFW) and the wide range of 
 information gave/given via these models, cross-country comparisons of farming-based extensions 
 programs are (without any point or purpose). 
 Beyond problems of measurement error and endogeneity, another possible reason for the 
 (appearing to be) weak hits/effects of these programs could simply be the quality of the farming-based 
 systems themselves. A worldwide review of public extension systems by Rivera, Qamar and 
 Crowder (2001) found that many farming-based extension systems were barely functioning, 
 related to the following factors: 
 ï· Limited scale and (the ability to keep something around, or keep something going): In countries where the farm part/area is 
 contained of small-scale farmers, extension clients often live in (related to where mountains, rivers, cities, etc., are located) 
 broke up areas. This can result in high costs, limited (land-area-based/location) coverage and 
 impossible to do/impossible to keep going services (Anderson and Feder 2007). 
 ï· Policy (surrounding conditions) that reduce the value of information gave/given 
 via extension services, mainly due to terms of trade that are tilted against 
 farming, poor (set of machines) and (not good enough) input supplies. 
 11 
 
 For example, earlier studies on the hit/effect of farming-based extension (T&amp;V) in India found that T&amp;V had no 
 
 significant hit/effect on rice production but increased money-based returns in wheat by 15 percent (Feder and Slade 
 1986, Feder, Lau and Slade 1987). Yet almost the same  studies of T&amp;V in Pakistan found only small hits/effects on wheat 
 (Hussein, Bylerlee and Heisey 1994). 
 
 5 
 
 ï· Weak linkages between research centers, universities and farming-based 
 extension systems. While extension services in the US and Europe are often 
 linked with the university system, this may not be the case in developing 
 countries. As a result, the (rewards or reasons for doing something) of these starts are not matched up with/even with 
 farming-based (things that are important) in the country (Purcell and Anderson 1997) and 
 technologies are not always locally changed. 
 ï· Low (desire to do something/reason for doing something) and responsibility of extension field staff. As is the 
 case with all public servants, watching the presence and (desire to do something/reason for doing something) of 
 extension staff is hard. This is especially filled with problems in the case of 
 farming, where field agents work in different areas and 
 performance indicators are based upon inputs that are hard to (check for truth/prove true) (ie, 
 number of trainings, number of people). Lack of watching can result in 
 (not there; not present) or poor-quality field staff, further reducing the utility of farming-based 
 extension services. 
 ï· Little difficult/strict/high quality (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) of the hits/effects of such extension on farmers' 
 welfare. The lack of reliable (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) on the hit/effect of farming-based extension 
 worsens problems related to money/giving money (to), (desire to do something/reason for doing something) and the availability of 
 appropriate technologies. 
 In this (surrounding conditions), it is not only unclear whether farming-based extension systems are 
 functioning, but whether these systems are overcoming information (left and right sides not matching) for smallholder farmers related to farming-based technology. 
 
 3. 
 How ICTs Could Affect Farming-based Adoption and Extension in 
 Developing Countries12 
 3.1. Mobile phone coverage and adoption in poor countries 
 Farming-based extension systems were imagined and developed in response to information 
 (left and right sides not matching) for poor farmers, especially those with limited access to other sources of 
 information (landlines, newspapers and radios). While (set of machines) investments still remain 
 low in many developing countries, one of the biggest changes over the past ten years 
 has been an increase in mobile phone coverage and adoption. In sub-Saharan Africa, for 
 example, less than 10 percent of people/of the group had mobile phone coverage in 1999, 
 increasing to over 60 percent of people/of the group in 2008 (Aker and Mbiti 2010). 
 
 12 
 
 ICT is an umbrella term that includes any communication device or computer program, such as radio, television, 
 
 mobile phones, computers and network hardware and software. We will mostly focus on mobile phone 
 technology in the big picture  of this paper, given its role in developing countries. Internet penetration is still 
 (compared to other things) limited in Africa. 
 
 6 
 
 Coinciding with this growth in coverage has been an increase mobile phone adoption and 
 usage, even in some of the world's poorest countries. There were 16 million subscribers in 
 sub-Saharan Africa 2000, growing to 376 million in 2008. Almost the same  rates of mobile phone 
 adoption have been watched/followed in Latin America and Asia (Figure 3).13 The number of mobile 
 phones per 100 people in developing countries often goes beyond access to other information 
 technologies, such as landlines (Jensen 2010), newspapers and radios (Aker and Mbiti 2010). 
 3.2. The Hit/effect of ICTs on Farming-based Information, Extension and Adoption 
 The fast growth of mobile telephony in developing countries has introduced a new search 
 technology that offers a few advantages over other other choices in terms of cost, (land-area-based/location) 
 coverage and ease of use (Aker and Mbiti 2010). While radios can be used across all 
 segments of people/of the group (over 55 percent of sub-Saharan African families listen to the 
 radio weekly), they generally provide a limited range of information and offer only one-way 
 communication ((related to information about people) and Health Surveys, different countries). Newspapers are 
 mostly mainly located in city-based  areas, are expensive and are (unable to be used or understood) to (can't read or write) 
 (groups of people/animals/things). Less than 19 percent of people in sub-Saharan Africa read a newspaper at 
 least once per week, with a much smaller share in areas away from cities (DHS surveys, different 
 countries). Landline coverage has been limited, with less than one landline subscriber per 
 100 people in 2008 (ITU 2009). Access to other search (machines/methods/ways), such as fax machines, email, and internet, is (in almost the same way) low. And finally, personal travel to different locations to get 
 information not only needs/demands the cost of transport, but also the opportunity cost of an 
 person's time. 
 Aker and Mbiti (2010) provide an summary of the (machines/methods/ways) through which mobile phone 
 telephony can affect money-based development in sub-Saharan Africa, including improved 
 access to market information and coordination among agents; increased job creation; 
 improved communication among social networks; and the development of new services, 
 such as mobile banking. In that vein, this paper identifies six possible (machines/methods/ways) through 
 which mobile phones could possibly improve farmers' access to information about 
 farming-based technologies and adoption in general, as well as access to and use of farming-based 
 extension services especially. 
 How Mobile Phones can Improve Access to (Private) Information 
 Mobile phones can improve access to and use of information about farming-based 
 technologies, possibly improving farmers' learning. As Figure 2 shows, farmers require 
 information on a variety of topics at each stage of the farming-based production process. In 
 many developing countries, such information has usually/(in the past) been given via personal 
 exchanges, radio and maybe landlines and newspapers. Compared with these (machines/methods/ways), 
 13The 
 
 number of subscribers represents the number of active SIM cards in a country. This could either 
 
 overestimate the number of subscribers (as one individual could have multiple SIM cards) or underestimate the 
 number (as many people can use one phone and SIM). 
 
 7 
 
 mobile phones can reduce (a lot) the costs of getting farming-based information. 
 Figure 4 shows the per-search cost of price information for different types of search 
 (machines/methods/ways). Mobile phones are much less expensive than the equal per-search 
 cost of personal travel or a newspaper, yet more expensive than landlines or radio. 
 Anyway, landlines are not easily available in most areas of the country, and radio 
 only provides price information for clearly stated/particular products and markets on a weekly basis. 
 The reduction in search costs connected with mobile phones could increase farmers' access 
 to information via their private sources, such as members of their social network (Baye, 
 Morgan and Scholten 2007, Aker 2010, Aker and Mbiti 2010). This could speed up or 
 increase farmers' contact with other adopters in a social network, by that/in that way allowing farmers 
 to learn from more "neighbors'" trials of a new technology or watch/notice those trials more 
 often.14 While this could possibly increase the rate of technology adoption, it could 
 also reduce the rate of adoption in the presence of learning externalities (Foster and 
 Rosenzweig 1995, Foster and Rosenzweig 2010).15 
 How Mobile Phones can Increase Access to Information via Farming-based Extension 
 Services 
 Reduced communication costs could not only increase farmers' access to (private) 
 information, but also to public information such as those gave/given via farming-based extension 
 services. Figure 5 shows the not important cost (carried by the extension system) of providing 
 farming-based price information, either via extension agent's visits, short message service (SMS) 
 or a call-in hotline, based upon data from a SMS-based market information service in Niger. 
 The not important cost of providing market information via SMS is cheaper than providing the 
 same information via an added extension visit, and is equal to providing the same 
 information via radio.16 Reducing the costs of spreading around information could increase the 
 extension system's (land-area-based/location) scope and scale, as well as help more frequent and good 
 communications between extension agents and farmers. This could, in turn, improve the 
 14In 
 
 addition to the hit/effect of mobile phones on getting information on a technology, mobile phones could 
 
 speed up information flows within a social network, by that/in that way increasing access to informal credit, savings and 
 insurance and in that way affecting a farmer's adoption decision (Aker and Mbiti 2010). 
 15Increased 
 
 access to information - either via learning by doing or learning from others - will not necessarily lead 
 
 to higher rates of adoption, as learning that a new technology is not effective will reduce adoption in the next 
 period (Foster and Rosenzweig 2010). There are also two potential opposite (or fighting against) effects of social networks on the 
 adoption decision: an individual farmer's (reward or reason for doing something) to adopt increases as the number of members in his or her 
 social network using the new technology increases; yet this also creates an (reward or reason for doing something) to delay adoption due to freeriding behavior and information spillovers (Foster and Rosenzweig 1996). 
 16While 
 
 the fixed costs for building radio towers and mobile phone base stations differ by location and 
 
 country, within a given country or location, the fixed costs of building a radio tower are just like those of a 
 mobile phone base station. In many cases, however, the costs of building the radio tower are carried by the 
 (government). If these (set of machines) costs are included, then radio is (compared to other things) more expensive as compared with 
 mobile phone technology, whose (set of machines) costs are usually carried by the (people and businesses that are not part of the government). 
 
 8 
 
 quality (or value) of the information services gave/given. Yet the hit/effect of these reduced costs 
 on farmers' adoption decisions will depend upon the ability of such information to serve as 
 substitute for in-person (machines/methods/ways). 
 How Mobile Phones can Improve Farmers' Management of Input and Output 
 Supply Chains 
 A few studies have highlighted the importance of risk and supply-side restrictions as 
 (blocking things) to farming-based technology adoption (e.g., Suri honest/appearing soon). By reducing 
 communication costs, mobile phones could help (not wanting to do anything dangerous) farmers in identifying potential 
 buyers for their products over larger areas and at important moments, by that/in that way 
 reducing price risk and possibly increasing the net benefits of the technology. (in almost the same way), 
 improved communication between farmers and traders could also help the provision of 
 inputs to areas away from cities, possibly reducing their cost. 
 Mobile Phones can help the Delivery of Other Services 
 Over the past few years, mobile phone operators have developed a variety of mobile services 
 and applications in developing countries. The most well-known/obvious of these is mobile money 
 moves (from one place to another) (known as m-money), a system within which/by which money can be moved (from one place to another) to different 
 users via a mobile phone. M-money computer programs can help the delivery of (completing/matching) 
 services to farmers (such as access to credit or savings, or farming and health insurance), 
 by that/in that way helping to address some of the "missing markets" that can hold back technology 
 adoption (Foster and Rosenzweig 2010). 
 How Mobile Phones can Increase Responsibility of Extension Services 
 Simple mobile phones can be used as a means of collecting both farmer and agent-level data, 
 by that/in that way improving the responsibility of extension services (Dillon 2011). Voice and SMS can 
 be used to collect data on farmers' adoption, costs and yields on a more frequent basis, 
 rather than waiting for once-a-year farming-based surveys, when recall data on costs and production 
 are often subject to measurement error. Also, mobile phones can be used to (check for truth/prove true) 
 agents' visits, almost the same as  what has been done with cameras in Indian schools (Duflo, Hanna 
 and Ryan 2007). Both of these computer programs could improve the watching of extension 
 systems, an often-noted restriction. 
 How Mobile Phones can Increase Communication Linkages with Research Systems 
 By improving the communication flows, mobile phones could possibly strengthen the link 
 between farmers, extension agents and research centers, and the other way around, too - by that/in that way 
 overcoming criticism of the "disconnect" between the two in many developing countries.

 Using ICTs in Farming-based Extension 
 
 For 20 years, "traditional" forms of ICTs have been used in advice-giving service provision. 
 Radio and TV programs regularly feature weather and farming-based information in developing 
 countries, and (away from cities) telecenters have given information on price and quality (Goyal 2010). 
 In some countries, national ministries of farm-related have tried to (combine different things together so they work as one unit) ICTs into 
 information delivery services, specifically by beginning and building on district information centers (FARA 
 2009). With the growth of mobile phone coverage, many of these efforts have moved 
 away from "traditional" ICTs to mobile telephony, including voice, SMS and internet-based 
 services. Table 3 provides a survey of these projects, labeled by the method of 
 spreading around (voice, radio, SMS and internet) and their first (or most important) purpose (FARA 2009). 
 ï· 
 Voice-based information delivery services mostly include telephonea 
 based information delivery services that provide guidance on farming methods and 
 market access. Some of these services use callain centers or hotlines for farming-based 
 extension support. The (machines/methods/ways) range from the use of a simple telephone - 
 such as landlines or mobile phones - to more complicated technology and 
 figuring out/calculating computer programs (FARA 2009). 
 ï· 
 Radio dial-up and broadcasts include regular radio broadcasts that 
 provide market prices or other farming-based information, as well as dialaup radio that 
 feature a series of short part sound  programs (FARA 2009). The radio system 
 often features a regularly updated menu of prearecorded farming-based content. In 
 some cases, the systems allow farmers to ask questions via SMS and the responses 
 are spread around via the radio (FARA 2009). 
 ï· 
 SMS-based extension services mostly use message-based (raised, flat supporting surfaces) to 
 collect and spread around information. This includes data collection via a simple SMSbased list of questions; sending an SMS-based code to request information (on market 
 prices or farming-based production) and receiving the response via SMS; and receiving 
 mass SMS on farming-based topics (FARA 2009). 
 ï· 
 E-learning programs usually include telecenters and internet small stores/computers that 
 allow farmers to access computers and the internet for agriculture-related 
 information. 
 The information gave/given via these different (machines/methods/ways) includes market prices, weather, 
 technical guidance and suppliers and buyers in local markets. A majority of these services focus 
 on market prices, weather and transport costs, most likely because this information is easy to 
 collect and spread around, goal and less likely to experience/likely to get measurement error (although quickly 
 outdated and constantly changing). Projects that provide information on farming-based 
 practices and inputs are (compared to other things) rare, possibly because such information is more detailed 
 and hard to bring across. 
 
 10 
 
 While all of these (machines/methods/ways) offer possible other choices to traditional means of 
 spreading around information, there are challenges to using ICT in farming-based extension 
 systems. First, the use of ICT-based farming-based extension is highly dependent upon the type 
 of information gave/given. For example, while information on market prices and weather 
 might be easily spread around via mobile phones and therefore replace traditional extension 
 (machines/methods/ways), more detailed information on farming-based practices and inputs might be 
 (completes/goes along with). Second, SMS-based (raised, flat supporting surfaces) - which are often the easiest to establish - can 
 only hold limited information and require that users have some reading and writing ability skills and 
 (related to computers and science) knowledge. Such services can be useful in providing simple or (done or made to look the same way every time) 
 information but are as easily able to change for more complex information exchanges. Third, 
 while voice-based Q&amp;A services overcome the limits of textabased (raised, flat supporting surfaces) and can 
 provide more detailed information, they can be complicated to develop or require machines 
 to produce natural speech. Some early efforts have made sound  files (easy to get to, use, or understand) to farmers 
 through the use of mobile phones (Kenya, Uganda and Zimbabwe). Finally, since many of 
 these computer programs and services have been developed and managed by the (people and businesses that are not part of the government), the 
 use of these efforts for farming-based extension will most likely require some sort of publicprivate partnership. All of these factors suggest that ICT-based extension services could 
 basically change the way in which farming-based information is given in developing 
 countries, and highlights the need for testing whether such approaches are more effective 
 and (producing a lot with very little waste) in providing information to farmers in developing countries.

 Measuring the Hit/effect of ICT-Based Farming-based Extension Programs 
 5.1. Identifying the Hit/effect of ICT-Based Farming-based Extension 
 
 Mobile phones are one tool among many for spreading around and collecting information on 
 farming-based technologies, produces and prices in developing countries. Before scaling up such 
 helping actions, it is necessary to test the hit/effect of existing ICT-based approaches. Such 
 tests should try to face/deal with the following questions: 
 1. 
 What is the hit/effect of ICT-based farming-based programs on farmers' 
 knowledge, farming-based adoption and welfare? In other words, are changes in 
 results watched/followed before and after the helping action due to the ICT-based 
 helping action or other factors? This needs/demands identifying a (proof that one thing definitely causes another) effect of the program, 
 either the average treatment effect (ATE), the average treatment effect on the 
 treated (ATT) or the plan/purpose to treat (ITT). 
 2. 
 Are the watched/followed changes in results due to the ICT project or 
 access to the mobile phone? Sometimes, ICT-based projects provide 
 people (who were part of a study, etc.) with access to mobile phones. Since mobile phones can affect farmers' 
 access to information and services through different channels, it is necessary to 
 untangle the hit/effect of the ICT-based service from the hit/effect of mobile phone 
 usage. 
 
 11 
 
 3. 
 What are the (machines/methods/ways) behind the treatment effect? In other words, 
 how (or through what pathway) does the ICT-based farming-based extension service 
 change farmers' access to information, learning and adoption? 
 4. 
 How does the guess of the treatment effect differ by farmer type 
 and the type of information gave/given? Beyond the average effect of the program, 
 testing the mixed-up nature of the treatment effects among different groups can 
 provide important information for scale-up. 
 5. 
 What are the possible spillovers of the ICT-based program, both on 
 other project people (who were part of a study, etc.) and non-people (who were part of a study, etc.)? An advantage of mobile phone 
 technology is that it can be shared among many users, by that/in that way allowing non-users to 
 possibly benefit from the service. While such spillovers can complicate the 
 identification of the treatment effect, including their hit/effect into the treatment 
 effect is necessary in order to understand the patterns of the technology and 
 technology adoption. 
 6. 
 Is the ICT-based approach cost effective as compared with 
 traditional (machines/methods/ways)? Is it a substitute or complement for traditional 
 approaches? 
 7. 
 Are the results externally valid? In other words, are they related to 
 other areas within the same country, other (groups of people/animals/things) or other countries? If so, 
 under what conditions? 
 These questions provide a possible (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) for designing hit/effect tests of ICTbased farming and farming-based extension programs. The next sections will discuss some of 
 the clearly stated/particular challenges to identifying the hit/effect of these programs and offer some 
 recommendations for managing and doing such tests 
 5.2. Threats to Identifying Hit/effect of an ICT-Based Farming-based Program 
 A simple two-period econometric model of the hit/effect of the ICT-based program might take 
 the following form: 
 Yit = Î´ + Î±dit + X'itÎ³ + Z'vÏ + Î¸t + Î¸v + Î¸i +uit + Îµvt 
 
 (1) 
 
 where Yit is result (number or thing that changes) of interest, such as farmers' farming-based knowledge, technology 
 adoption, yields, farm-gate prices or welfare; dit is an indicator (number or thing that changes) for assignment of 
 individual i into the ICT-based farming-based extension program at time t; Xit is vector of 
 farmer-level (features/ qualities/ traits); Zv is a vector of village-level (a measure of what occurs naturally/sports boundary line) (features/ qualities/ traits); and Î¸t, Î¸v , 
 and Î¸i are time-, village- and individual-level fixed effects, (match up each pair of items in order).17 uit is unseen 
 17Time-varying 
 
 farmer-level (features/ qualities/ traits) (X'it) may be preferred to (a measure of what occurs naturally/sports boundary line) (features/ qualities/ traits), which would be 
 
 removed by fixed effects or first-differences estimators. 
 
 12 
 
 farmer ability or weird shocks and Îµvt is a common village-level error part. 
 Equation (1) is a difference-in-differences (DD) (detailed description of exactly what is required), comparing the group means 
 of the treatment and control group between the pre- and post period. The model could be 
 changed in a variety of ways, including controlling for Î¸it (an interaction between farmer 
 fixed effects and season fixed effects) or learning (by including the number of adopters in a 
 farmer's social network) (Foster and Rosenzweig 2010). 
 There are many challenges to identifying the treatment effect, Î±.18 While some of these 
 threats are common to all impact tests, some are (designed only for/happening only within)  ICT-based farming-based 
 extension programs. These include: 
 ï· 
 Identifying the appropriate (going against known facts) for the treatment group. 
 Assuming that the possible results are ((may or may not happen, depending on something)ly) independent of the 
 treatment status (dit), then Î± will measure the treatment effect of dit on Yit. 
 Anyway, this needs/demands controlling for possible differences in (capable of being seen and known) or 
 unobservable (features/ qualities/ traits) by beginning and building on a proper (going against known facts) group (de 
 Janvry, Dustan and Sadoulet 2010). 
 ï· 
 Securing/making sure of common types of information across treatment groups. 
 Most hit/effect tests represent the program by a binary indicator (number or thing that changes) (dit ). 
 In the case of ICT-based farming-based extension programs, however, there can be 
 many treatments, depending upon the (machine/method/way) used for spreading around the 
 information (e.g., SMS, voice, in-person visits, SMS and in-person visits). While this 
 is easily resolved econometrically by including different indicator (numbers that change/things that change), the 
 first (or most important) challenge is in the (understanding/ explanation) of the treatment effect; each treatment may 
 not only differ in the method of spreading around but also the type (or quality) of information 
 gave/given. For example, voice-based services permit farmers to ask questions and 
 receive more described/explained information, whereas in-person visits can allow extension 
 agents to (show or prove) a new way of doing things. This hints that the treatment effect will 
 capture the hit/effect of both the (machine/method/way) and the information brought across.19 
 ï· 
 Untangling the effects of the mobile phone from hit/effect of the 
 ICT-based extension. If the ICT-based farm-related program helps people (who were part of a study, etc.)' 
 access to a mobile phone, mobile phone ownership or usage might have a wealth 
 effect, by that/in that way decreasing the relative costs of an farming-based technology or 
 18The 
 
 (understanding/ explanation) of Î± will depend upon the design of the program. For example, in programs where the ICT- 
 
 based extension service is randomly assigned at the community-level, there may not be a one-to-one relationship 
 between assignment to the extension service and a household or farmer's decision to use the service. In this case 
 there is (not totally pure/not totally correct) obedience, and standard average treatment effects may not be guessed. Rather, an Plan/purpose 
 to Treat (ITT) or Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE) will be guessed for compliers (Imbens and Angrist 
 1994, Angrist and Imbens 1995). 
 19 
 
 Using an indicator (number or thing that changes) for hit/effect tests also does not take into account the strength of treatment, 
 
 which is possibly endogenous. 
 
 13 
 
 increasing the benefits connected with that technology. This can therefore make it 
 hard to untangle the benefit of the mobile phone from the benefit of the ICTbased farming-based extension program. 
 ï· 
 Separating out the mobile phone adoption decision from the 
 farming-based adoption decision. In most traditional farming-based extension 
 programs, (using/getting to) information only needs/demands the opportunity costs of the farmer's 
 time. In the case of ICT-based farming-based extension, getting that same 
 information also needs/demands how to use the new mobile phone technology. This dual 
 adoption decision can affect a person (who was part of a study, etc.)'s decision to use the ICT-based farm-related 
 system. 
 ï· 
 Controlling for spillover effects. Spillover produces within villages are 
 common for traditional farming-based extension programs. Yet such programs usually 
 have (almost nothing/very little) spillover effects between villages, unless extension agents or farmers in 
 treated villages share information with those in control villages. With access to 
 mobile phones, farmers can contact members of their social networks more 
 easily, by that/in that way increasing the chance of inter-village spillovers. This can also lead 
 to wider general balance effects, especially if farmers change production 
 patterns or marketing behavior and are focused/mainly located within a specific (land-area-based/location) 
 location. 
 5.3. Potential Field Experiments in ICT-Based Farming-based Extension 
 A variety of econometric ways of doing things can be used to guess equation (1) and address 
 the possible threats to truth/trueness identified in Section 5.2. These include natural experiments 
 or randomized controlled trials (RCTs); moving backward (instance where things are uneven and interrupted) design (RDD); matching; 
 difference-in-differences; and instrumental (numbers that change/things that change). Each approach has relative strengths 
 and weaknesses in terms of internal and external truth/trueness (de Janvry, Dustan and Sadoulet 
 2010) and practical putting into use. This section proposes some general ways of thinking/basic truths/rules for 
 conducting tests of ICT-based extension programs, and provides two examples of 
 setting up field experiments to guess the hit/effect of ICT-based farming programs. 
 There are some general ways of thinking/basic truths/rules that can be used to guess the effect of ICT-based 
 farming-based extension programs. These include focusing on microeconometric impact analysis, 
 which allows for a more careful identification of the appropriate (going against known facts) (de Janvry, 
 Dustan and Sadoulet, 2010); collecting pre- and post data for treatment and comparison groups, so that 
 DD can be used to control for time-different unobservables on the basis of the common 
 trend idea (you think is true); assigning treatments at the village level (rather than the individual, household or 
 plot level) to (make small) possible spillovers on the comparison group20; collecting data on social 
 20 
 
 Anyway, sometimes, watching/ noticing/ celebrating/ obeying the (behavior pattern)s of learning could be of interest. In this case, while 
 
 treatment could be at the village or cooperative level, different plans could be used to target opinion leaders 
 or decision-makers to better understand how this affects information-sharing and adoption. 
 
 14 
 
 networks within villages, in order to identify possible learning across people; assigning one 
 group to receive "(fake medicine)" phones (i.e., phones that are givenout access to the ICT-based 
 extension service), in order to identify the hit/effect of the ICT-based service from mobile 
 phone usage; and using random assignment, randomized phase-in or clear-cut judging requirements to assign units 
 into the treatment and control groups, so that selection bias can be controlled for more 
 clearly. More clearly stated examples of potential experimental setups are given below. 
 Example #1. A SMS-Based Market Information System (MIS) Experiment 
 Over 35 percent of the ICT-based programs in Table 3 provide market information to 
 farmers, either via radio, SMS or internet. Traditional tests of these programs compare 
 farmers' results (e.g., prices and sales) before and after the program, or compare the 
 results of farmers with access to the program to those without access. Yet simple prepost or (happening at the same time) comparisons will not control for potential selection bias and do 
 not address some of the key questions and threats organized and listed in Sections 5.1 and 5.2. 
 A potential experimental design for guessing the effect of an ICT-based MIS program 
 could include three treatments and one control: 
 ï· 
 
 T1: Regular market information system offered 
 
 ï· T2: Regular market information system offered and "(fake medicine)" phones 
 distributed 
 ï· T3: SMS-based market information system offered and mobile phones 
 distributed 
 ï· 
 
 Comparison: No market information or mobile phones 
 
 If these treatments are randomly assigned across different groups, then this would secure/make sure of 
 independence between the treatment status and the possible results, by that/in that way allowing us 
 to have a (proof that one thing definitely causes another) (understanding/ explanation) of the treatment effect.21 What's more, since people in T2 
 would get mobile phones but not access to the SMS-based MIS, we would be able to 
 untangle the wealth effect of the mobile phone from the hit/effect of the ICT-based 
 information system (e.g., comparing T2 with T3). We could further guess the demand for 
 such services by changing the price of the service in T3, possibly by offering the service at 
 full cost, a paid-for cost or free. And finally, by assigning treatment at the village level, this 
 would (make small) the possible spillover effects across villages.22 
 21 
 
 Since there may be (not totally pure/not totally correct) take-up of the MIS system - in other words, farmers may be assigned to 
 
 treatment but not choose to use the service - then we could measure either the ITT or the LATE. For a 
 discussion of the ideas (you think are true) needed/demanded for LATE in (set of machines) programs, see Bernard and Torero (2011). 
 22We 
 
 could also change the field experiment to guess the treatment effect for specific sub-groups (e.g., women 
 
 or men, different educational levels), or by targeting particular people or opinion leaders within the group. 
 
 15 
 
 Despite the improvements of this approach as compared with a simple first difference 
 analysis, there are a few weaknesses to this experimental design. First, even a "basic" field 
 experiment with three treatment groups and one control group would require a sample size 
 of between 200-300 villages, depending upon the power calculations. This problem could be 
 worsened if there is weak obedience among those assigned to the program, especially if 
 information via the extension service is shared between users and non-users.23 Second, the 
 design does not address the potential general balance effects of the program. If farmers 
 start buying and selling in new markets due to the MIS, then this will affect local demand 
 (supply) on those markets and possibly affect producers and people from comparison 
 villages. For this reason, this design will only esti<p><strong>NOTE: This document is incomplete. It was shortened to the maximum document length of 50,000 characters.</strong></p><div style="clear:both">&nbsp;</div>
