 ABSTRACT 
 Dinar, A. and Yaron, D., 1992. Adoption and (being left alone, with no help) of crop-watering/rinsing with water technologies. 
 Agric. Econ., 6: 315-332. 
 Adoption and (being left alone, with no help) processes are carefully studied for seven crop-watering/rinsing with water technologies. A 
 procedure is developed to guess the technology cycle and applied to data available for 
 citrus groves in a few areas of Israel, and Gaza. The technology cycle was used to 
 guess diffusion-(being left alone, with no help) patterns for a few crop-watering/rinsing with water technologies that have been 
 forgotten. Results suggest that the technology cycle is (like nothing else) to each technology and 
 almost the same  in length for all areas. Results (describe the future) the year of full (being left alone, with no help) of each 
 technology. For modern technologies still in the diffusion phase, a logistic equation was 
 fitted to the grouped data. Results suggest that diffusion is significantly affected by 
 money-based (numbers that change/things that change) such as water price, crop yield price, and helping payment for crop-watering/rinsing with water equipment. Use of the guessed equations for policy purposes suggest that water price and 
 helping payment for crop-watering/rinsing with water equipment can be used to control the diffusion process (speed and 
 ceiling) of the crop-watering/rinsing with water technologies.

 sion of technologies have guessed rates of adoption and levels of adoption until the stage when the process reaches its ceiling (e.g., Jarvis, 1981; 
 Jansen, Walker and Barker, 1990). Less attention has been loyal to/been dedicated to the 
 stage when the invention of new things is forgotten, which happens at least as often 
 in the history of (related to computers and science) changes. A discontinuance of technology can 
 be the result of (related to computers and science) substitution (Fisher and Pry, 1971; Rogers, 
 1983; Cameron and Metcalfe, 1987) which creates technology cycles. 
 In the development of new technologies it is very important for the developer, 
 or the policy maker, to guess the expected life span of the technology in 
 order to carefully study the effects of possible policy (numbers that change/things that change) on the resulting 
 number of users of that technology (or any other measure for strength of 
 use). A few studies have recognized the importance of crop-watering/rinsing with water technologies in the process of farming-based development (Hayami and Ruttan, 1971; 
 Kulshreshtha, 1989). The money-based books on crop-watering/rinsing with water technology 
 diffusion has generally given information on diffusion of one or at most 
 two technologies (Fishelson and Rymon, 1989; Casterline, Dinar and Zitberman, 1989). Less attention has been loyal to/been dedicated to the (being left alone, with no help) phase 
 of the technologies. This is probably due to lack of information on use of 
 different technologies over time. 
 The purpose of this paper is to extend the existing books by showing 
 and guessing the diffusion-(being left alone, with no help) processes of a few crop-watering/rinsing with water 
 technologies. The next section provides a idea-based (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) for the 
 analysis which includes both the procedure for guessing technology cycles 
 and the (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) for guessing diffusion-(being left alone, with no help) and diffusion 
 curves for a few technologies. This (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) is applied to survey data 
 from citrus groves in Israel. As compared to previous studies, this data base 
 addresses seven crop-watering/rinsing with water technologies. The guesses for the diffusion 
 curves are used to (show or prove) and guess policy effects on the diffusion 
 of crop-watering/rinsing with water technologies. 
 CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK 
 
 The introduction of any technology can be described as composed of two 
 phases: in the first phase, the technology is introduced to an increased 
 number of users (or any measure of use, such as number of areas of land). This 
 phase is generally defined in the books as the diffusion of the technology. The second phase is seen as (lowering in number/getting worse) use of that technology. 
 The money-based books has (focused one's effort/increased/mainly studied) mainly on guessing diffusion 
 curves for technologies (e.g., Griliches, 1960; Jarvis, 1981). However, it is 
 also important for policy makers to know the rate and time at which a 
 technology will be left alone. The analysis given in this section distinguishes (using the words/word choices suggested earlier) between two groups of 
 
 IRRIGATION TECHNOLOGIES 
 
 317 
 
 technologies: (1) technologies that are in a process of (a feeling of being left alone and forgotten) or have 
 already been left alone, and (2) technologies that are still in the diffusion 
 process. 
 For the first group of technologies, a procedure is suggested to guess 
 the technology cycle and is applied to data for citrus groves. The technology cycle provides data used to guess a quadratic expression of share of 
 users for a given technology over time (a diffusion-(being left alone, with no help) pattern), 
 which is applied to guess the time of a complete discontinuance of that 
 technology. For the second group of technologies diffusion logistic curves 
 are guessed. Crop yield price, water price, and government helping payment for 
 crop-watering/rinsing with water equipment are used to explain diffusion rates. 
 
 A procedure for guessing technology cycles 
 The term 'innovation cycle' in farming was used by Kislev and 
 Shchori-Bachrach (1973). They guessed the effects of different profiles of 
 adopters on the diffusion rate and ceiling for farming-based use of plastic 
 sheeting, without, however, guessing the length of the invention of new things cycle. 
 A few studies (Coughenour, 1961; Church supervisor and Coughenour, 1964; 
 Deutschmann and Hevens, 1965) (examined closely) the reasons for discontinuing 
 inventions of new things, but no invention of new things cycle was guessed. (reducing/ slowing/ slowly moving)wood (1988) 
 guessed product lifespan patterns for new industrial products. His model 
 provides an guess for the overall life of a given technology from the first 
 day of its appearance in the market until its final disappearance. Although 
 the idea  of technology cycle was completely/in a hinting way included in (reducing/ slowing/ slowly moving)wood 
 (1988), no use or guess was given. 
 Guess of diffusion and (being left alone, with no help) processes for technologies 
 used in the distant past may face problems of reliable data since supporting paperwork on the number (or share) of users may not be complete for the whole 
 period. This may partially explain past (problems, delays, etc.) in guessing technology 
 cycles. The current study is lucky to have data that allows detection of 
 the diffusion-(being left alone, with no help) process. A few data points exist: (1) the number of users (or areas of land) and time (year) when the technology was first 
 introduced, (2) present information on use of the technology, and (3) 
 information is also available on the number of new adopters during the 
 diffusion phase only but not during the (being left alone, with no help) phase. 
 Diffusion and (being left alone, with no help) of a given technology without a 
 complete data set for the stage of (a feeling of being left alone and forgotten) can be described using the 
 idea  of technology cycle that provides the rate at which technologies are 
 being replaced. A technology cycle is defined here as the time period 
 between the adoption of a particular technology by a decision maker and 
 its (being left alone, with no help) or replacement by another technology. This idea  has 
 
 318 
 
 A. DINAR AND D. Y ARON 
 
 been used broadly in models of equipment replacement (e.g., Rifas, 1957, 
 p. 67) that suggest replacement patterns for equipment used by identical 
 producers. Therefore, the technology cycle after now presented is not a 
 behavioral model (such as the model in Kislev and Shchori-Bachrach, 
 1973), but rather, a procedure to fit a curve to incomplete time series data. 
 In doing so, one assumes that each technology is related to a given 
 life span (cycle) that does not change over time or as a result of market 
 events. This is a simplifying idea (you think is true) since technology cycles may be 
 influenced by competing technologies, and prices, although, there are 
 facts or conditions (that surround someone) when this is not necessarily true (Dinar and Zilberman, 
 1991). Therefore, the guesses here can provide an upper bound to the 
 technology cycle. 
 Let t = t 0 , .-. , tT, ... , tT be the carefully studied time period where t 0 and tT are 
 the first and last years with watched/followed number of adopters, and t T is the last 
 year in the sample for which the actual number of users of a particular 
 technology is known ((see/hear/become aware of) that tT ';:?; tT). 
 N 1T is the watched/followed number of users of the technology at time tT, and n 1 
 is the number of new adopters in year t. The changeable n 1 is defined as the 
 total number of adopters in year t, assuming (at this stage) no 
 discontinuance or (being left alone, with no help) of that technology (pure collection). 
 Then: 
 
 (1) 
 This definition of n 1 accounts for the total amount of number of possible 
 users as it appears in the data set. Since the above expression does not take 
 into account the number of growers leaving alone (and forgetting) the technology, the value 
 for n 1 at year t is not in agreement with the watched/followed value for users of the 
 technology in year t, and therefore: 
 
 (2) 
 and 
 
 (3) 
 The changeable Nt is the guessed number of users of the technology at 
 year t that is completely/in a hinting way expressed as:

 where z is the technology cycle (years).

 done using a (testing out) program (tested out values for drag-line are presented in Fig. 2) and a reasonable range of initial values for z. The chosen 
 value (z *) is the one that meets the judging requirements of equation (7).

 To (show or prove) the use of the technology cycle for creating the data 
 needed to guess a diffusion-(being left alone, with no help) curve for a given technology, 
 assume for example, data for a 7-year period, and a cycle of 4 years. The 
 number of new adopters each year is 5, 7, 4, 3, 4, 3, 0, over the period of 
 the 7 years. The actual number of users will therefore be 5, 12, 16, 19, 18 
 (19 + 4- 5), 14 (18 + 3 - 7), 11 (14 + 0- 3). (see/hear/become aware of) that for the first 4 . 
 years, the technology was in a phase of diffusion and then for 3 years it is in 
 an (being left alone, with no help) process. 
 
 Diffusion-(being left alone, with no help) curves for crop-watering/rinsing with water technologies that have been 
 forgotten 
 For technologies in the (being left alone, with no help) phase, a diffusion curve is developed using the first number of adopters and the guessed technology 
 cycle, z *. The watched/followed pattern for these technologies displays a quadratic 
 curve over time (Fig. 2). The quadratic functional form to be guessed for 
 that process is: 
 
 (8) 
 In this expression N 1 is the total amount of share of adopters by year t. The 
 index t was (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy)ized by setting the first year of the diffusion at 1. b 1, b 2 , 
 and b 3 are the guessed coefficients. First-order conditions with respect to 
 t provide the guess for the year (t*) in which the ceiling was reached: 
 
 (9) 
 Substituting t * into the quadratic diffusion curve (8) yields the guessed ceiling, Nt *. For t &amp;gt; t * the diffusion process is negative, meaning 
 that the technology is being forgotten. For technologies that are still in a 
 
 IRRIGATION TECHNOLOGIES 
 
 321 
 
 process of (a feeling of being left alone and forgotten), the year of complete (being left alone, with no help) can be guessed by solving equation (8) with the guessed values for the b/s, and 
 setting N 1 to be zero. 
 Effect of input and output prices on th(British pounds)! diffusion of modern crop-watering/rinsing with water 
 technologies 
 
 Some studies have recognized that diffusion of a technology 
 could be affected by the product price and the money-making ability expected to 
 result from the technology. Griliches (1960) showed that the rate at which 
 growers accept a new farming-based technology depends, among other things, 
 on the importance of the (money made/good thing received) to happen/be made real from the changeover. 
 Mansfield (1963) showed that diffusion rates of new technologies in a few 
 businesses were positively related to the money-making ability of those technologies. 
 Jarvis (1981) showed that both the rate and the extent of diffusion for new 
 technologies were positively related to the money-making ability of those technologies. Using a normative model, Dinar and Letey (1989) (showed/shown or proved) the 
 positive combined effects of charges for crop-watering/rinsing with water water and capital payments for crop-watering/rinsing with water technologies on the money flow/money-based studies of technology selection 
 under different limiting (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) conditions. Possible and scientific 
 (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) referred to in Feder, Just and Zilberman (1985) and in Thirtle and 
 Ruttan (1987), provides the basis to develop an scientific model to guess 
 effects of output prices and input costs on the diffusion of technologies. 
 Long-term investment decisions such as in crop-watering/rinsing with water equipment are based 
 on past and future price expectations for inputs and output. For the 
 purpose of our analysis assume that only past prices of input and output (in 
 year t - t) affect the decision to invest in crop-watering/rinsing with water equipment. 
 This section (shows or proves) the use of money-based (numbers that change/things that change) to guess 
 diffusion curves. These (numbers that change/things that change) represent crop yield price, water price, 
 and payments given by the government for the investment in crop-watering/rinsing with water 
 technologies. (The model is applied to technologies that are still in the 
 diffusion phase.) 
 The basic logistic equation for the diffusion process is: 
 (10) 
 
 where d 3 , which is the rate of diffusion, is assumed to be a function of crop 
 a money-making state, water price, and the helping payment for the investment in the technology (capital cost). By expressing d 3 as a linear function of these (numbers that change/things that change) 
 (d 3 = 1/Jo + I/J 3 P1_t + I/J 4 P1"!.t + !f;5 S1_t), the basic logistic equation becomes 
 (Jarvis, 1981): 
 
 (11) 
 
 322 
 
 A. DINAR AND D. YARON 
 
 where P1 _ 1 is a (number or thing that changes) measuring crop a money-making state, P1"'!1 is water price, 
 and S 1 _ 1 is a (number or thing that changes) measuring helping payment level for the capital cost of the 
 technology in year t-t. 
 DATA AND EMPIRICAL SPECIFICATIONS 
 
 The models presented earlier were applied to data from a study of citrus 
 groves in Israel. The study sample includes only groves which are owneroperated, and are greater than 2.5 ha (1 ha = 2.5 areas of land or 10 dunams). 
 Left out/kept out are groves operated either by (producing crops/helping something grow) companies on the basis 
 of fixed payment, or by part-time operators 1- These kinds of operators 
 were watched/followed to (be given a reason to do something) by money-based things to think about very 
 different than full time owner operators (e.g., Guttman and Haruvi, 1986; 
 Feder et al., 1988). A total of 209 groves owned by kibbutz (total 
 settlement), moshav (cooperative settlement), and private owners were 
 sampled. These groves are from settlements in six areas (from north to 
 south: Hadera, Ra'anana, Rehovot, Lackish, Negev and Gaza). The sampled area accounts for 16% of the total citrus area in Israel (Table 1). 
 Lists of questions were completed during the course of interviews conducted 
 with growers between October 1986 and April 1987. General information 
 on sample size and current distribution of crop-watering/rinsing with water technologies by areas 
 is presented in Table 1. 
 Crop-watering/rinsing with water technologies in common use during the study period were (in 
 order of their introduction to the market): (1) traditional crop-watering/rinsing with water such as 
 border and groove, (2) hand-moved sprinklers (aluminum pipes), (3) solid 
 set sprinkers above (cloth covering that shelters) (after now referred to as 'above-(cloth covering that shelters)'), (4) 
 drag-line sprinklers under (cloth covering that shelters) (plastic pipes), (5) solid-set sprinklers 
 under (cloth covering that shelters) (plastic pipes), (6) low volume micro-sprinklers and micro-jets, 
 and (7) drip crop-watering/rinsing with water. The first four crop-watering/rinsing with water technologies have been 
 forgotten by farmers in most of the areas. The later three technologies 
 are still in a process of diffusion in most of the areas. These three 
 technologies will be identified after now as 'the modern technologies'. 
 Added/more information relating to/connected to the data, as well as described/explained technology (features/ qualities/ traits) and connected costs, can be found in Dinar and Yaron 
 (1988). Information (related to/looking at/thinking about) number of groves, and adoption periods for 
 different technologies by area is presented in Table 2. 
 It should be noted that the guessed share of these groves was 40% of the total area, but 
 their share in production was less than 15% due to bad maintenance. Also, many of these 
 groves went out of production atfer 1987 (N. Ravid, Head, Ext. Serv. Dep. Citrus, Hakiria 
 Tel-Aviv, personal communication, 1990).

 The period of interest for purposes of this study began in the fifties 
 (although data for some technologies exist from the beginning of the 
 century), when hand-moved sprinkers replaced the usual furrow crop-watering/rinsing with water in some established groves and also became the crop-watering/rinsing with water technology introduced in newly established groves. The hand moved sprinklers

 system, consisting of aluminum pipes, was labor-tensive and allowed very 
 little flexibility relating to/connected to crop-watering/rinsing with water schedule. 
 Drag-line systems which were first introduced in the early sixties have 
 been in use for the longest period of time, although this technology is 
 labor-intensive and very hard to control. The introduction of solid set 
 sprinkelrs both above and under the (cloth covering that shelters) saved labor and added/gave to 
 better control of water application to individual trees. Both of these 
 technologies however, are capital intensive and labor long/big in comparison to the usual furrow crop-watering/rinsing with water. Other disadvantages connected 
 with the solid set technologies involve operational (problems, delays, etc.), crop-watering/rinsing with water 
 water evenness and equality, and salinity problems (in the case of above-(cloth covering that shelters)). 
 Micro-jet and micro-sprinker systems (after now referred to as microsprinklers) introduced in the seventies are capital intensive, but require 
 only low water pressure, save labor, provide better crop-watering/rinsing with water water evenness and equality, and are easy to control. Drip crop-watering/rinsing with water systems (show or prove) the 
 same advantages as micro-sprinkers, and are also less capital intensive than 
 micro-sprinklers. 
 For the purpose of guessing the effect of money-based (numbers that change/things that change) on 
 diffusion, three (numbers that change/things that change) were used. The first (number or thing that changes) is the export price 
 (P1 _ 1 ) for the shamuti variety of citrus ($_$ per 10 kg), on the idea (you think is true) 
 that shamuti prices represent other citrus variety prices. (Shamuti is also 
 the main crop in the data base.) The information for building this 
 (number or thing that changes) was collected from data recorded in the (related to studying numbers) Abstract of 
 Israel (different years) with values represented in 1984 constant dollars. The 
 second explanatory (number or thing that changes) is water price ( P1"!_), calculated in $_$ jm 3 
 (1233.5 m 3 = 1 acre-foot) from the (related to studying numbers) Abstract of Israel (different 
 years) assuming the same price for all areas. This idea (you think is true) is quite 
 reasonable under conditions winning/most common in Israel since water prices are 
 commanded/written down by a central authority which does not discriminate among areas. 
 The third (number or thing that changes) is the helping payment rate (S 1 _ 1 ) on government loans for 
 crop-watering/rinsing with water equipment (Israel Ministry of Farming, different years). These 
 rates may differ by technologies, but it is assumed that no difference exists 
 between areas. This idea (you think is true) holds for the areas included in the 
 data base, but not necessarily for other areas which may receive preferred helping payment rates. 
 For the purpose of guessing the diffusion logistic curves for solid set, 
 micro-sprinklers, and drip, no honor/difference is made among areas and all 
 209 (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) are grouped in one data set. 
 RESULTS 
 
 Data on the current shares of the different crop-watering/rinsing with water technologies in 
 different areas are presented in Table 1. In 1987, more than 50% of the 
 
 325 
 
 IRRIGATION TECHNOLOGIES 
 
 group of trees  area (groves and growers may be used after now in the same context) 
 was prepared with modern crop-watering/rinsing with water technologies. The diffusion processes 
 of these technologies began in the ealry sixties to the early seventies 
 depending on the area and the crop-watering/rinsing with water technology (Table 2). Handmoved sprinklers were adopted in the fifties in five areas, but by 1987 this 
 system was no longer in use (except for less than 1% of the area in 
 Hadera). Above-(cloth covering that shelters) sprinklers were adopted in the three northern 
 areas (Rehovot, Ra'anana, and Hadera), but are found today in only 
 2.3% and 7.9% of group of trees  area in Ra'anana and Hadera areas, (match up each pair of items in order). Drag-line sprinklers were adopted by growers in five areas but are 
 used today on only 32% of the citrus groves in Negev, 40.5% in Lackish, 
 21.4% in Rehovot, 23.8% in Ra'anana, and 8.3% in Hadera. 
 For each crop-watering/rinsing with water technology with (lowering in number/getting worse) use over time, data are 
 available on the number of groves now practicing that technology (as 
 of 1987), and once-a-year number of adopters from as early as 1901 to 1987. The 
 missing piece of information relates to the number of growers leaving alone (and forgetting) 
 the technology each year. The procedure developed to guess the technology cycle was applied to the data on groove, hand-moved, above-(cloth covering that shelters), 
 drag-line, solid-set, and micro-sprinklers for each area separately. (The 
 technology cycle can not be applied to technologies still in a diffusion 
 process using the approach developed here.) Results for the technology 
 cycle guesses are presented in Table 3. The guessed technology cycle 
 for furrow crop-watering/rinsing with water is 26-30 years; the cycle for hand-moved sprinklers is 
 22-24 years, for above-(cloth covering that shelters) sprinklers it is 26-28 years; for drag-line 
 sprinklers it is 17-20 years; for solid-set sprinklers it is 17 years (only in the 
 Negev); and for micro-sprinklers the cycle is 15-17 years (only for Negev 
 and Hadera Areas). In general, the Negev and Lackish areas show 
 shorter technology cycles for all crop-watering/rinsing with water technologies than the other

 areas. However, these differences were not found to be (related to numbers) 
 significant. 
 The number of farmers using a particular crop-watering/rinsing with water technology being 
 rejected, was calculated for each area using the technology cycle. Then 
 quadratic logistic equations were guessed using a non-linear, repeating/repetitive, 
 least squares procedure (SAS, 1985). Since there is a huge/extreme volume of 
 information, only results for Rehovot and Hadera areas are presented in 
 Table 4. A curve showing the guessed diffusion and (being left alone, with no help) of 
 drag-line sprinklers in Hadera area is presented in Fig. 2. Results for all 
 areas and technologies can be found in Dinar and Yaron (1988). 
 The coefficients presented in Table 4 (and added/more coefficients that 
 are not presented) were used to guess the year when the diffusion 
 process reached its ceiling for different technologies. Application of the 
 procedure (equation 9) to the drag-line sprinkler equation (Table 4), 
 points to/shows that the ceiling was reached 15-19 years after the beginning of 
 the diffusion process (depending on the area). For technologies being 
 rejected (but not yet forgotten), the coefficients in Table 4 also make it 
 possible to guess, the year when a technology will be fully forgotten.

 For the drag-line sprinklers that were still in use on small parts of/amounts of 
 groves in the different areas, it is guessed (not presented) that this 
 technology will disappear 30-35 years after initial adoption. Specifically, it 
 is guessed that during the year 1990, drag-line systems will no longer be 
 used in the Negev, lackish, and Hadera areas; and in 1995 they will also 
 disappear from Rehovot and Ra'anana areas. Almost the same  guesses exist for 
 other technologies and are available upon request. 
 The three 'modern technologies' - solid-set sprinklers, micro-sprinklers 
 and drip systems - are used in all areas (except for Gaza where drip was 
 not used). Therefore, grouped logistic diffusion curves were guessed 
 for the sample data. A range of lag periods from 1 year to 5 years was used 
 in the analysis (not presented), however, a lag of one year gave/given the 
 most reasonable results. A one-year lag is therefore used here, assuming 
 that a decision (related to/looking at/thinking about) the installation of a technology in year t depends 
 upon conditions existing in year t - 1. Some (problems, delays, etc.) were met 
 in guessing these logistic curves. In all cases the Durbin-Watson (D.W.) 
 statistic is in the (able to travel pretty far) range, pointing to/showing (not resulting in anything) results with 
 regard to positive (one after the other) relationship. Draper and Smith (1981) suggest such 
 cases be treated as if a (one after the other) relationship had been found. Because of these 
 (problems, delays, etc.), the coefficients are not presented. In order to correct for the 
 possible presence of first order (one after the other) relationship, the Hildreth-Lu procedure (Pyndick and Rubinfeld, 1981) was applied. The corrected logistic 
 expression is now:

 Pt-1 = Pt-1- yPt-2

 and 
 st-1 = st-1- ySt-2 
 
 and y is a scalar of grid values (0 &#126; y &#126; 1). 
 Equation (12) was guessed for a range of y values using the same 
 procedure as equation (10). The chosen value for y is that given by the 
 smallest sum of squared leftover/extra for the moving backward runs. The chosen values 
 of y are presented in Table 5 for each technology; an autoregressive 
 change was performed and the results of the moving backward runs are 
 also presented. Values for the D.W. statistic are now higher than in the

 original moving backward, pointing to/showing that no (one after the other) relationship exists in the changed guessed leftover/extra. 
 In all cases the guessed ceiling (d{) is higher than the actual share of 
 adopters in 1987, pointing to/showing that the diffusion process will reach its ceiling 
 after that year. All coefficients affecting the diffusion process behave as 
 reported in the books: an increase in shamuti export price, in water 
 price, and in helping payment rate for modern crop-watering/rinsing with water equipment, will increase 
 the share of the modern technologies used in citrus groves. These findings 
 are in agreement also with results given by Caswell and Zilberman, 
 1985). The speed at which the ceiling will be reached can also be influenced by those (numbers that change/things that change). For example (not presented in the tables), if 
 export prices remain at 1987 level while holding all other (numbers that change/things that change) constant, ceiling will be reached in the years 1999, 2000, and 2001 for solid-set, 
 micro-sprinklers, and drip, (match up each pair of items in order). If export prices increase by 10% 
 ceiling will be reached one year earlier than in the previous case for all 
 technologies. A decrease of the same rate in export price will result in a 
 one-year delay in approaching the ceiling for all technologies.

 Fig. 3. Effect of helping payment for crop-watering/rinsing with water equipment on the diffusion of drip (national data). 
 
 There are some tradeoffs between greater use of modern technologies, 
 or shorter adoption periods, and social cost. For example, in case of 
 externalities in the production process related to crop-watering/rinsing with water, a (related to a large area) 
 authority might be interested in change to (producing more with less waste) crop-watering/rinsing with water 
 technologies. This change is related to added/more investment that 
 might be paid-for by (community of people/all good people in the world) through tax dollars, and should therefore be 
 tested this way. The effect of changes in helping payment rates for crop-watering/rinsing with water equipment on diffusion of drip is (showed/shown or proved) in Fig. 3. A helping payment

 rate for crop-watering/rinsing with water equipment of 20% would result in reaching the ceiling 
 four years earlier (1997 instead of 2001) than with a helping payment rate of 15%, 
 where as with a helping payment rate of 25%, the diffusion reaches ceiling in 1994. 
 The time gained by the increased helping payment can be weighted against possible 
 losses resulting from continued use of the existing crop-watering/rinsing with water technology. 
 Another (act of showing or proving) of the usefulness of the results is presented in 
 Fig. 4. Here two policy (numbers that change/things that change) are substituted in order to (accomplish or gain with effort) the 
 ceiling of the diffusion process for drip crop-watering/rinsing with water at year 2000: water price 
 and helping payment rate, both of which can be controlled by the government and 
 used for policy purposes. By drawing a substitution curve between these 
 two policy (numbers that change/things that change) (using the guessed equation for drip crop-watering/rinsing with water in 
 Table 5), it was found that the substitution rate is larger in cases where 
 water prices are high (substitution rate of 0.1) than in cases of low water 
 prices (substitution rate of 0.05). These findings can, therefore, serve the 
 policy maker to improve the combination between these two (numbers that change/things that change). 
 CONCLUSIONS 
 
 In this study adoption and abandoment processes of crop-watering/rinsing with water technologies in citrus groves were guessed and showed. Data from Israel and 
 Gaza were used to: (1) estimate technology cycles for different crop-watering/rinsing with water 
 technologies, (2) guess, using the technology cycle, the process of 
 diffusion-(being left alone, with no help) of technologies already in the process of rejection, and (3) confirm guesses established in previous possible and 
 scientific studies relating to/connected to the effects of input and output prices on 
 the diffusion processes of crop-watering/rinsing with water technologies still in the diffusion phase. 
 It was found that the technology cycle length for a given technology is 
 dependent only on the technology and not on physical conditions winning/most common 
 in different areas (e.g., weather, soil types etc.). For technologies being 
 forgotten, the technology cycle was used to guess the year of discontinuance. These findings can serve policy makers of developing farming-based 
 areas, as well as manufacturers of crop-watering/rinsing with water equipment who are interested in (describing the future) years of use for a given technology. 
 In many cases, policy makers must think about/believe the effects of possible 
 policies on the behavior of growers in order to (accomplish or gain with effort) changes in useful things/valuable supplies 
 use. For example, in the United States, the new 1990 Farm Bill thinks about/believes 
 policies to improve water (using less of something) and reduce pollution problems. In 
 Asia, as crop-watering/rinsing with water water becomes the binding restriction for rice production, improvements in crop-watering/rinsing with water (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) will need to be found. Studies 
 suggest, among other means, that farmers should improve their crop-watering/rinsing with water 
 performances by change to modern crop-watering/rinsing with water practices. The current 
 study, although based on data from one area, provides ideas that can 
 
 IRRIGATION TECHNOLOGIES 
 
 331 
 
 be used in other places. Effects of input and output prices on diffusion of 
 modern crop-watering/rinsing with water technologies were guessed and used to demonstrate 
 the effectiveness of possible combinations of policy (number or thing that changes) levels on 
 (accomplishing or gaining) a range of technology diffusion rates. These (numbers that change/things that change) were found 
 to be very effective in deciding/figuring out rate and ceiling of the diffusion process.
