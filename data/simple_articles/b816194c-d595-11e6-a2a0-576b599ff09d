 Abstract 
 Both informal and formal loans matter in farming. However, formal lenders provide many more production loans than 
 informal lenders, often at a cost (mostly loan default cost) higher than what they can recover. For example, the Farming-based 
 Development Bank of Pakistan (ADBP), providing about 90% of formal loans in areas away from cities, gets/causes high loan default costs. 
 Yet, like other governments, the Government of Pakistan supports the formal big plan/layout/dishonest plan on the grounds that lending to farming 
 is a high risk activity because of covariate risk. Because of this, such policies are often based on a market failure argument. As farm 
 credit big plans/layouts/dishonest plans are give money tod, policy makers must know if these big plans/layouts/dishonest plans are worth supporting. Using a recent large household 
 survey data from (away from cities) Pakistan ((away from cities) (money-related) Market Studies or RFMS), we have tried to guess the effectiveness 
 of the ADBP as a credit delivery institution. A two-stage method that takes the endogeneity of borrowing into account is 
 used to guess credit hit/effect. Results show/tell about that ADBP adds/gives to household welfare and that its hit/effect is higher for 
 smallholders than for large holders. Anyway, large holders receive most of ADBP finance. The ADBP is, this way, not a 
 (producing a lot for a given amount of money) institution in delivering (away from cities) finance. Its (producing a lot for a given amount of money)ness can be improved by reducing its loan default cost 
 and partially by targeting smallholders in farming where credit produces better results.

 1. Introduction 
 
 Credit is important for development. It capitalises 
 farmers and businesspersons to begin/try new investments or put into use new technologies. It helps smooth 
 consumption by providing working capital and reduces poorness in the process. Both formal and informal 
 lenders are active in (away from cities) credit market (Adams and

 and Demaine, 1992; Udry, 1990). Organizeral-free lending, closeness, good delivery and flexibility in loan 
 transactions are some of the attractive features of informal credit. 2 However, informal finance may not be as 
 good for development as formal finance because: 
 2 Although the (in name only/very small amount) rate of interest is lower for formal loans 
 than for informal loans, the transaction costs of borrowing are 
 higher for formal loans than for informal loans. Some informal 
 lenders also (sing, dance, act, etc., in front of people) an important role by helping the marketing 
 of products or buying of inputs, such as fertiliser. Also, 
 since informal loans are often given in kind and for specific 
 purposes, some client needs are served better by informal than by 
 formal loans.

 (i) it is expensive; 3 (ii) it is (for only a short time) and mostly 
 used for eating/drinking; and (iii) it is not generally large 
 enough to cause/increase  investment and growth. 
 Not prevented by/not part of the issue the limits of informal finance, 
 many governments have tried in the past to develop different banks to provide credit 
 to farmers and other (away from cities) producers. Many such attempts have failed not only in delivering credit to target families but also in (helping increase/showing in a good way) a doable/possible credit 
 delivery system. High covariate risk of farming-based 
 production (Binswanger and Rosenzweig, 1986), the 
 not mirror-images information, lack of enforcement of loan 
 contracts (Hoff and Stiglitz, 1990),4 government unwise interference in credit markets, and rent-looking (for) 
 as a result of credit restricting (Braverman and Guasch, 
 1989) are some of the factors accused to be responsible 
 for the poor performance of the government-directed 
 credit big plans/layouts/dishonest plans in many countries. 
 With the sad/bad picture of state-owned (away from cities) finance 
 organisations, non-governmental micro-finance institutions have been growing to meet the credit needs of 
 small producers in many countries. Reports point to/show 
 that they now meet the credit demand of 10-12 million people in Africa, Asia and Latin America. 5 Many 
 of these organisations are give money tod not for soaking up high loan default costs but for covering high transaction costs connected with group-based lending and 
 other social intermediation costs (Khandker, 1988). If 
 farming-based credit and other targeted big plans/layouts/dishonest plans are to be 
 supported, policy makers must know how much they 
 are give money tod, who receives this helping payment, and whether 
 it helps the borrowers. 
 Testing the net (thing that's given/work that's done) of a program means 
 testing both its costs and benefits. Testing the 
 costs of lending involves the credited market cost of 
 the helping payment these big plans/layouts/dishonest plans receive from the government and (people who give money or other things). Testing benefits is often filled with problems because money is exchangeable and it is not clear if 
 3 Some studies, however, question the too much/too many interest rates of 
 informal lenders (e.g. Hussain and Demaine, 1992). 
 4 To reduce the moral danger-related problem and connected transaction costs of lending, banks often ask for physical 
 money. Money restrictions leave out/keep out the poor who do not have 
 valuable things, such as land, to offer as money but are otherwise good 
 credit risks. 
 5 For a discussion of a broad range of programs, see Otero and 
 Rhyne (1994), Name et al. (1994), Brugger and Rajpatirana 
 (1995), and Hulme and Mosley (1996). 
 
 the measured credit effect reflects the borrowing restriction or the unobservable (features/ qualities/ traits) of a borrower. The presence of bias caused by self-selection of 
 borrowers into credit programs may bias test 
 of benefits of these programs by as much as 100%. 6 
 Anyway, there are some studies that have 
 successfully guessed program benefits (Binswanger 
 and Khandker, 1995; Carter, 1988; Carter and Weihe, 
 1990; Feder et al., 1990; Pitt and Khandker, 1996, 
 1998). Binswanger and Khandker (1995) guessed the 
 hit/effect of formal credit using district-level panel data 
 from India and found that formal credit increases (away from cities) income and working well, and that benefits go beyond 
 the cost of the formal system by at least 13%. Feder 
 et al. (1990) guessed a switching moving backward model 
 for families in China and told the difference between 
 families that are credit-held back and those that 
 are not. 
 Pitt and Khandker (1998) examined the hit/effect of 
 credit from the Grameen Bank and other two targeted credit programs in Bangladesh on a variety of 
 individual and household results, including school 
 enrolment, labour supply, valuable thing holding, life-creating ability and 
 (device or drug that prevents pregnancy) use. They found credit to be a significant 
 (thing that decides something) of many household results, and 
 that program credit has a significant effect on 
 the well-being of poor families in Bangladesh. 
 Khandker (1988) watched/followed that micro-credit programs 
 are as (producing a lot for a given amount of money) as other programs, such as the 
 food for work, in benefiting the poor. 
 The goal of this paper is to analyse the role 
 of the Farming-based Development Bank of Pakistan 
 (ADBP) in areas away from cities and test its (producing a lot for a given amount of money)ness 
 in delivering farm credit. The paper's (thing that's given/work that's done) lies in adding to the existing books on the 
 (producing a lot for a given amount of money)ness of a government-supported farm 
 credit program which has not been managed well 
 for years. The data used in this paper's analysis 
 are drawn from the (away from cities) (money-related) Market Studies 
 (RFMS) of Pakistan. Results suggest that the effect 
 of ADBP finance is big, and that the hit/effect 
 is higher for smallholders than for medium and large 
 holders in farming. But, given the distribution of 
 loans and loan recovery rates, ADBPs lending program is not (producing a lot for a given amount of money). The program can be made 
 (producing a lot for a given amount of money) by supporting smallholders (who own

 up to 2.5 areas of land of land) more than medium and large 
 holders, by improving both loan recovery and (related to managing and running a company or organization) (wasting very little while working or producing something), and by making operations responsible 
 to a lending (mix of stocks, bonds, etc./document collection).? 
 The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 describes the survey and sample data used for the study. 
 Section 3 describes the (away from cities) credit market in Pakistan. Some studies including recent data show 
 that the (your share of sales out of all sales) of institutional credit is low (even though there is the existence of) government helping action since 1960. Also, formal credit has did not reach the borrowers who may 
 be able to use credit more productively. Section 4 explains the econometric model used to asses the credit 
 hits/effects on different household results. Section 5 
 discusses the moving backward results. Based on two-stage 
 guess ways of doing things, formal credit is found to have 
 significant good effects on most household results thought about/believed in this paper. Section 6 shows how 
 much social costs are involved for ADBP in providing credit. Section 7 presents the cost-benefit analysis 
 of the ADBP. The ending/deciding section summarises the 
 findings and discusses policy options. 
 
 2. Data 
 Data from the RFMS, collected for the State Bank 
 of Pakistan with (money-related) help from the World 
 Bank in 1996, are used. Household survey and informal lenders' survey data were collected by two 
 organisations: (1) the Applied Money-based Research 
 Centre (AERC, 1998) of the University of Karachi 
 and (2) the Punjab Money-based Research Institute 
 (PERI) in Lahore. The Pakistan Institute of Development Money flow (PIDE) in Islamabad collected 
 the institutional data on the ADBP and commercial 
 banks working in the (away from cities) part/area. Household survey 
 data were collected for all five areas of Pakistan, 
 namely, north western edge of something/unexplored area area of control/area of land (NWFP), 
 Sindh, Balochistan, Punjab and Pakistan controlled 
 Kashmir (AJ&amp;K). A (away from cities) household survey was 
 conducted on the pattern of the LSMS surveys managed and did/done by the World Bank to provide the data base. 
 7 By providing more loans to smallholders, transaction costs 
 may increase but loan default costs will decrease, because the loan 
 recovery rates are higher for smallholders than for large holders 
 in farming. 
 
 The survey covered different parts of the household 
 (process of people making, selling, and buying things), including (information about the numbers of different kinds of people), labour 
 supply, household expense, income sources, farm 
 production, borrowing practices, valuable things and (things you owe/things you're responsible for/disadvantages). 
 A two-stage layered sampling plan was 
 put into use for selection of villages and families. In the 
 first stage, 250 villages were selected randomly from 
 a total of about 50,000 villages in Pakistan 
 (as reported in Farming-based Statistics, 1994-1995). 
 The portion of villages within the areas was 
 done in proportion to (helped to grow) area. A completely 
 randomised sampling plan was put into use for each 
 (related to a local area) sample. Villages were selected randomly 
 from the area of control/area of land after leaving out/keeping out very small and very 
 large villages, depending on the size distribution of 
 villages within each area of control/area of land. 
 In the second stage, household information from 
 each village was used to sample families on the 
 basis of landholding size and/or (related to working on the job) distribution. A (official count of everyone who lives in a country, city, etc.)  of families was done in each of 
 the selected 250 villages to gather information on landholding size and (related to working on the job) distribution. To sample 
 families within a village, a three-stage procedure 
 was adopted. First, the number of families selected 
 from a village was in proportion to the total household counts of villages. Second, the distribution of the 
 families drawn from a village was in proportion to 
 the distribution of landholding categories. Finally, the 
 families to be interviewed were drawn randomly 
 from the total number of families in each category 
 in each village. In all, the survey covered 6000 families from the 250 selected villages, for an average of 
 24 families per village. However, because of data 
 collection errors, we finally managed to use data on 
 4380 families from 217 villages in this paper. In order to reflect the actual distribution, we used sampling

 Table 3 
 Distribution of loans by sources 
 Formal sources 
 
 Our data collection plan was such that we collected consumption and other information for the last 
 reference farming-based year (1995/1996), while information collected on loans referred to the 5 years coming before the survey. Table 2 presents the distribution of 
 sample families (4380) by loan categories. A total 
 of 2581 families (that is, 59%) were reported to 
 borrow from any source over the 5 year period. A total of 180 families borrowed from formal sources. 
 Out of these families, 91 also borrowed from informal sources. Table 2 also shows the distribution of 
 borrowing status by area of control/area of land. As Punjab has by far 
 the largest population (55% of families sampled 
 were from Punjab), it is no wonder it has the highest 
 percentage of borrowing families (51%). Although 
 families borrowing from formal sources represent 
 only 7% of all borrowing families, formal sources 
 account for 21.9% of total loan amount/quantity, because the 
 average size of formal loans is much larger than that of 
 informal loans (Table 3). This means informal sources 
 still account for 78% of the loan volume in (away from cities) Pakistan. However, the share of formal credit has been 
 increasing slowly and regularly (PACC, 1973, 
 1985, 1995). 
 The data show that ADBP has been the most in control/most common 
 source of formal credit, while 'friends and relatives' 
 is the largest source of informal credit. The ADBP

 provides 86.5% of total institutional loans followed 
 by government sources (4.8%), NGOs (3.7%), commercial banks (3.2% ), and co-operatives (1.8%) 
 (Table 3). Friends and relatives, who do not usually 
 charge any interest, provide 57.2% of the informal 
 loan volume, while interest charging informal lenders 
 (such as arthi, 8 input suppliers, shopkeepers, commercial agents and others) provide the remaining 
 42.8% (Table 3). Of these 42.8%, (managers of apartment buildings) account 
 for 12.8% followed by shopkeepers (7%), arthi (6%), 
 input dealers (6% ), and many  other suppliers (11% 
 together) (Table 3). 
 8 Arthi is an informal lender (almost the same  to input suppliers), who 
 provides lending for an activity and in return gets repaid mostly 
 in kind in terms of output. For example, an arthi can lend money 
 for fertiliser (instance of buying something for money) and the borrower can pay back in terms of 
 output crop.

 Operational landholding = land owned+ land rented+ land sharecropped-in - land rented out - land left rude. Household category 
 by operational holding has been defined as: landless (no land), survival/income (0 area of land &amp;gt; land ::::: 5 areas of land), small (5 areas of land &amp;gt; land ::::: 12.5 areas of land), 
 medium (12.5 areas of land &amp;gt; land ::::: 25 areas of land), and large (land &amp;gt; 25 areas of land). 
 
 The data show that formal credit is meant mostly 
 for production and investment, while informal credit 
 is mostly for eating/drinking smoothing. As Table 4 
 shows, only 5.2% of formal loan amount/quantity, compared 
 with 55.5% of informal loan volume, went to meet 
 consumption and other personal needs. However, 
 informal loans are given mostly for shorter periods 
 (77.5% of them are for a length of time of l year or less), 
 while formal loans are mostly long-term (76.7% are 
 for more than a year). More importantly, formal credit 
 goes almost completely to support farming-based production (87.5%), while only 26.9% of informal loans 
 support farming. Past studies also have shown that 
 formal credit adds/gives significantly to farming 
 of (away from cities) Pakistan (Zuberi, 1989; Malik et al., 1991). 
 Zuberi (1989) finds that 70% of total formal credit is 
 used to buy seed and fertiliser. 
 The issue now is to what extent formal credit matters to agriculture. Zuberi (1989) ends/decides that most 
 of the increases in farming-based output can be explained 
 by changes in the amount of seed and fertiliser expense. Malik et al. ( 1991) tries to provide (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) 
 for the role of formal credit in farming-based produc- 
 
 tion. They use a two-stage structure in which the chance of taking a formal loan is (described the future) in the 
 first stage and the (described the future) value is used in the second stage to guess the hit/effect of fertiliser use per 
 area of land. 9 Like Zuberi's study (1989), their results show 
 that formal credit is an important (thing that decides something) of fertiliser and seed expense. The study of von Braun 
 et al. (1993) shows that farmers with access to credit 
 have 37% higher input expenses than those without such access. 
 The hit/effect of credit in farming, however, depends on who receives formal loans. Our survey data 
 shows that, families with large operational holding (more than 25 areas of land), who are about 4.1% of 
 all families, account for 41.6% of all families 
 borrowing only from formal sources (Table 5). 
 In contrast, families with no operational holding, 
 9 Malik et a!. ( 1991) use (numbers that change/things that change) such as household attitude 
 toward interest-bearing loan and village credit to measure the total 
 institutional credit received/got by the families in the village other 
 than the household in question. The last thing just mentioned tool measures the 
 hit/effect of (set of machines) and other village (numbers that change/things that change) on the demand 
 for credit.

 who make up/be equal to 34.2% of all (away from cities) families, account 
 for only 5.2% of the exclusive borrowers of formal 
 loans. A reverse picture/situation is found when it comes to 
 informal loans. Landless families contain 24.6% 
 of the families that borrow only from informal sources, whereas richest families make up/be equal to only 9.4% of the families in the same 
 category. 
 The skewed distribution of formal credit may have 
 an hit/effect on farming-based growth and (away from cities) poorness in 
 Pakistan. Since the working well of small householders is higher than that of large holders according to 
 established development books, the hit/effect of formal credit is expected to be higher for smallholders 
 than for large holders. Since the large holders receive 
 the majority of formal credit, one can guesse that the skewed distribution of formal credit 
 has a limiting effect on (away from cities) growth and welfare. 
 This is in fact a concern, even when only one-third 
 of (away from cities) borrowing in volume comes from formal 
 sources. 
 
 4. Credit impact test: an econometric 
 (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) 
 The purpose here is to guess the hits/effects of formal/institutional credit on (away from cities) welfare. Since formal/institutional part/area in Pakistan is ruled by 
 the ADBP, this amounts to guessing the hit/effect of 
 ADBP loans on (away from cities) household welfare. What (people who work to find information) watch/notice is the amount of credit received from 
 ADBP that is based on both the demand for and the 
 supply of credit. The real difficulty is how to untangle the demand from the supply. Often household 
 and area (features/ qualities/ traits) decide/figure out the household's demand for credit. But these same (features/ qualities/ traits) also 
 influence the supply of credit, giving rise to a problem of selection bias. It is possible that borrowers are 
 more productive not because of the loan, but because 
 they are more creative, and hard-working. It 
 is also possible that borrowers are productive and, 
 hence, able to pay back, not because they have better ability but because operate in a more productive (surrounding conditions). 
 Lenders such as the ADBP screen borrowers based 
 on their qualities and (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) (features/ qualities/ traits) which 
 are not easily watched/followed by (people who work to find information). So, the al- 
 
 location of ADBP credit is not random. 10 As money 
 are fixed, the lenders would like to set apart money 
 to the best possible borrowers and in the best possible agroclimate area. We used a competitors' model 
 (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) for the decision making process of ADBP 
 lending.

 that change/differ  over families such that E(sij [Xij, fhj) = 0, 
 and fJ y and 8 are unknown limits/guidelines. If all (numbers that change/things that change) 
 are (capable of being seen and known), 8 would decide/figure out the hit/effect of the 
 credit without bias. However, since fhj is unobservable, if the receipt of the credit serves as an indicator 
 of these unseen (numbers that change/things that change), this would result in (created unfair thinking in)/(unfair-thinking) guesses of ADBP credit in Eq. (1). 
 The standard approach to the way out of this 
 tough situation is to use instrumental (numbers that change/things that change). So we 
 guess the (things that decide other things) of borrowing in a first stage 
 that includes the instrumental (numbers that change/things that change) which do not 
 enter into the result Eq. (1), but can (describe the future) 
 the amount borrowed that does not depend on the 
 household/individual (features/ qualities/ traits). We then insert 
 the (described the future), rather than actual, amount in the second stage equation, which helps correct for selection 
 bias in the second stage. Think about/believe guessing first the 
 following borrowing equation: 
 (2) 
 
 The left-hand side (number or thing that changes) of (2) represents borrowing 
 from the ADBP, Zij (instrumental (numbers that change/things that change)) is a set of 
 household or village (features/ qualities/ traits) clear/separate from the 
 X's so that they affect only Cij but not other household behaviours (y;j) (may or may not happen, depending on something) on Cij; f3c, and JT 
 are unknown limits/guidelines, fh} is an unmeasured (thing that decides something) of Cij that is fixed within a village, and sij is

 biases.

 a nonsystematic error that reflects unmeasured (things that decide other things) that change/differ  over families such that E(c:ijiXiJ, 
 Zij, IL}) = 0. 
 One possible way of resolving the endogeneity of 
 credit is to decide/figure out whether there is any (coming from the outside of something) (ability to be picked/ability to participate) judging requirements used by lenders in selecting 
 borrowers. Such an (ability to be picked/ability to participate) rule was used by Pitt 
 and Khandker (1998) to sort out the endogeneity of 
 credit received/got from micro-credit programs such as 
 the Grameen Bank. They used a almost-experimental 
 survey design as an identification plan in a setting where (able to be picked/able to participate) and non-(able to be picked/able to participate) families based 
 on landholding were interviewed in both program and 
 control areas. Such an (ability to be picked/ability to participate)-based instrumentation is not appropriate for testing the hits/effects of 
 ADBP loans, since the ADBP has no (coming from the outside of something) loan 
 (ability to be picked/ability to participate) judging requirements. 
 Finding convincing tests/lists of questions (Zij (numbers that change/things that change)) is 
 therefore a critical part of this exercise. According to 
 demand explanation, the price can be a good instrument 
 for (describing the future) the demand for a good. The price of an 
 ADBP loan is its interest rate, which hardly differs/changes. 
 Hence, the interest rate cannot be a good (describe the future)or 
 of the demand for credit. We propose a set of (tools or objects used to do work or measure something) based on the idea (you think is true) that the loanable 
 fund of the ADBP is fixed and the demand for ADBP 
 loans is much larger. More than that, the ADBP pays 
 much more than what it gets ready as savings and its 
 loanable money mostly come from the government and 
 (people who give money or other things). In this case, it is not the price of a loan but 
 the availability of the fund that matters most in deciding/figuring out how much a household can borrow from the 
 ADBP. That brings us to the loan portion organization 
 of ADBP money based on the competition among borrowers. ADBP money is first gave out at the area of control/area of land 
 level, then at the district level, and then at village 
 level before they are finally paid to borrowing 
 families. At the district level certain districts are 
 preferred to others based on certain judging requirements and portions are made to those districts. In those districts 
 again, certain villages are preferred to others and money 
 are made available to those villages in the same way/in that way. Finally money is paid to certain families based 
 on their qualifications. So these money is subject to 
 competition at each level and the final payment 
 is the total amount of result of all competitions. 
 So given the available money, a household's borrowing from the ADBP depends not only on its own 
 
 203 
 
 (features/ qualities/ traits) but also on the (features/ qualities/ traits) of other 
 competing families who also look (for)  ADBP loans. 
 The competitor's (features/ qualities/ traits) are possible (tools or objects used to do work or measure something) in the borrowing equation. The competitors can 
 be at the village level as well as at the district level 
 where their usuals would influence a particular household's demand for credit without influencing 
 its results, such as consumption and investment. 
 So, for the portion of a rare/not enough  fixed fund, formal banks such as the ADBP would 
 think about/believe the (features/ qualities/ traits) of people, such as education and landownership of borrowers. 11 But while 
 these (features/ qualities/ traits) of a borrower living in a district 
 are important, almost the same  (features/ qualities/ traits) for other competing districts are also important in deciding/figuring out the fund 
 portion in a particular district. So, at the national 
 level we calculate not only the averages of household 
 indicators for district k but also the same for other districts leaving out/keeping out k. Then within the district k we calculate averages for both village j and other villages 
 leaving out/keeping out j. 
 For each village we calculate almost the same  averages of 
 household (numbers that change/things that change). These competitors' indicators 
 are then the (tools or objects used to do work or measure something) for identifying how much a 
 household can get from ADBP. So the Eq. (2) can 
 be rewritten as 
 
 + XU-i)ka + x1k1J + Xk-JP + Xko 
 + X p-kA + IL} +ILk: + c:ij 
 (2a) 
 
 CiJk = XiJkf3 
 
 where the added/more subscript is introduced to point to/show district (k). For example, Cijk represents credit of 
 household i in village j and district k, and ILk: is the 
 11 The idea is, given a fixed amount of loanable money, the more 
 (considered OK by banks to give credit to) the household's competitors are (as perceived by a 
 lender such as the ADBP), the less likely the household will be to 
 get credit. (quality of being considered OK by banks to give credit to) may mean different things to different 
 lenders. For example, if lenders look at the amount of landholding in deciding whether to give loans, a household may be less 
 likely to get a loan if its competitors hold more land on average. Another lender may focus on household head's education and 
 one more lender may take village (features/ qualities/ traits) into the process of carefully thinking about something in deciding on (quality of being considered OK by banks to give credit to). Even if the within-village 
 competitors' (features/ qualities/ traits) may not be good tests/lists of questions because 
 of 'spill-over' or 'social capital' arguments, the (features/ qualities/ traits) of 
 other villages in other districts are still valid tests/lists of questions, as they 
 are unlikely to have any spill-over effect. In any case, we carry 
 out a (detailed description of exactly what is required) test to permit whether they are valid tests/lists of questions, suggesting whether 2SLS model is more appropriate than 
 OLS model (where the amount of loan is taken as given).

 which are averages of household changeable X figured out/calculated 
 at the these levels: X(j-i)k at the village level for village j leaving out/keeping out household i, Xjk at the village level 
 for all families in village j, Xk- j at the district

 Borrowing reflects three possible results: (i) no 
 borrowing for lack of access to the ADBP; (ii) no borrowing when families decide not to borrow, even if 
 the ADBP is there; and (iii) a positive amount of borrowing, given that the household decides to borrow 
 and the ADBP branch is available. The coefficient of 
 credit in Eq. (la) measures the hit/effect of one more 
 rupee of borrowing from a formal source, such as 
 the ADBP, on household results such as consumption, allowing the household to (change to make better/change to fit new conditions) its borrowing 
 'portfolio' and all other behaviours, in response. 12 
 Although the maximum chance guess (MLE) is 
 better since it yields (producing a lot with very little waste) guesses, running MLE 
 is a awkward process compared to the two-stage 
 method which provides consistent guesses. Because of this, 
 we use a two-stage method to guess the hit/effect of 
 credit. 
 
 5. Guesses of credit hit/effect 
 In order to tell apart the  results based on two-stage 
 method just discussed with those that do not account 
 for possible selection bias, we present both sets of results for results of particular interest. Data on borrowing from the ADBP and other formal sources is 
 given for each household over the 5 years previous/coming before 
 the survey. The total amount of amount of borrowing from 
 formal sources over the 5 year period is the policy 
 (number or thing that changes). This would reflect the long-term decision of 
 12 We know that the (away from cities) credit market is (broken into parts) because of 
 restricted information flow. So there are other lenders in addition 
 to the ADBP serving different market pieces/parts. But our focus is 
 on the ADBP and we are interested in the added/more role that it can 
 play in raising household welfare, given the role of other lenders.

 We use (capable of being seen and known) household (features/ qualities/ traits) including the highest grades completed by a male and a female, the total numbers of adult males and females in 
 the household, the sex and age of the household head, 
 and land owned by the household as (things that you control (like study times), that cause other things to change (like test scores)). Village (features/ qualities/ traits), including the prices of 
 rice, wheat, gram, milk products, beef, fish, vegetables, molasses and sugar, fruits and maize are also 
 used to control for village effects in the moving backward, 
 which may reflect the 'distance effect'. The total amount of amount of credit taken by the families from the 
 ADBP, or the families' status of borrowing from 
 the ADBP over the last 5 years before the survey, is 
 used as a separate explanatory (number or thing that changes) in the welfare 
 equation, although it is the (thing that changes (like a test score) because of something else that you control (like study time)) in the 
 first stage moving backward. 
 The first stage to bit moving backward includes competitors' 
 (features/ qualities/ traits) as instrumental (numbers that change/things that change). Table 6 gives

 ADBP is zero. This is why watched/followed credit is a cut short (number or thing that changes), 
 and a tobit (detailed description of exactly what is required) is appropriate for tbe total borrowing 
 equation.

 summary statlstlcs of these (numbers that change/things that change) leaving out/keeping out the 
 village price (numbers that change/things that change). Table 7 presents the tobit guesses of the borrowing Eq. (2a). The importance of 
 the education (numbers that change/things that change) in the first stage tobit moving backward for ADBP loans points to/shows that policies directed 
 towards increasing the flow of information may improve access to ADBP loans. Note that families 
 with educated members take more formal credit. (in almost the same way), families with more land enjoy greater access 
 to formal loans. But the education and landholding of 
 the competitors of the same community seem to reduce a household's borrowing, given its education and 
 landholding. Note also that communities with higher 
 
 male education and higher average household landholding tend to receive a higher portion of ADBP 
 loans. 
 We use the logarithmic (detailed description of exactly what is required) for both the 
 total amount of credit and the other result 
 equations of interest. Table 8 summarises the effects 
 of formal credit on selected household welfare results. For comparison, we present both the OLS 
 and the two-stage results. Full moving backward results of 
 the two-stage equation can be found in Add on A 
 (Table A.l). While the two-stage results control for endogeneity of credit, the ordinary least squares (OLS) 
 guesses assume that credit is randomly given.

 The Durbin-Wu-Hausman test simply tests the importance of the 
 leftover/extra value that is (described the future) in the first stage moving backward and 
 included in the second stage moving backward. 
 
 To decide/figure out whether 2SLS (where endogeneity is 
 controlled using the competitors' (features/ qualities/ traits) as (tools or objects used to do work or measure something)) is more appropriate than OLS, we carried 
 out the Durbin-Wu-Hausman (DWH) test, which basically calculates an F-statistic for the leftover/extra term 
 that is (described the future) from the first stage Eq. (2a) and then 
 used as an explanatory (number or thing that changes) in the second stage 
 Eq. (1). 14 Table 9 reports the test results. They show 
 that in four out of six results there are planned 
 differences between the two models. This means in 
 these cases, the OLS results show that the amount of 
 credit from formal sources cannot be taken as given, 
 and it responds to the same (numbers that change/things that change) that affect the 
 results of interest. Because of this, the two-stage guesses 
 are preferred over the OLS guesses. 
 14 The second stage equation uses both the credit (number or thing that changes) and 
 the (described the future) leftover/extra as explanatory (numbers that change/things that change). 
 
 The two-stage guesses reported in Table 8 measure the response ability to stretch of result with respect 
 to borrowing from the ADBP. They show/tell about that ADBP 
 credit improves/increases household per person 
 consumption, for example. So, a 10% increase in 
 borrowing increases consumption by 0.04% for formal loans. Formal credit also increases crop production expenses of (away from cities) families. One major purpose 
 of credit is to support production costs such as hiring labour or buying fertiliser and other inputs. A 
 10% increase in borrowing from the ADBP increases 
 farming-based production costs by about 1%. 
 The effect of ADBP credit on the net value of farming-based production (i.e. gross value of production less 
 changeable production cost) is positive and significant. 
 A 10% increase in borrowing from a formal source 
 increases farming-based production by almost by 1%. 
 ADBP loans also increase female labour supply, without having any significant effect on male labour supply. The ability to stretch of the response of female labour 
 supply with respect to formal credit is 0.098, suggesting that a 10% increase in formal lending is related to about a 1% increase in female labour 
 supply. 
 We calculate the not important hit/effect of ADBP loans 
 based on the guessed response elasticities at the 
 mean values of both result and credit (numbers that change/things that change), 
 based on the preferred 2SLS model. Table 10 provides 
 these guesses which can be thought about/believed not important 
 returns to borrowing from the ADBP for different results of interest. Results point to/show that the not important 
 return of borrowing from the ADBP is 5% to consumption and 69% to net farm production.

 6. The AD BPs cost of lending 
 How much does it cost the ADBP to lend to the 
 farming community in Pakistan? The costs of and benefits (income) from lending by a formal lender such 
 as the ADBP are based on the costs of lending and 
 interest income came/coming from lending. In addition to 
 lending, investment and other businesses that a bank 
 begins/tries can create income. These can be found 
 in the bank's once-a-year report which provides a statement of income and expense from its activities. 
 However, the once-a-year report of the ADBP does not 
 reflect the true cost of its activities. For example, it 
 receives give money tod money from the government and 
 (people who give money or other things), and the once-a-year report does not reflect the opportunity cost of such money (PIDE, 1998). In order 
 to test ADBPs true cost of lending, we must account for the payments it receives since these payments come at a cost to the government and the (community of people/all good people in the world). 
 Since an (very big/very strong) part of/amount of the formal loans 
 comes from the ADBP (86.5% as shown in Table 3), 
 the cost of (that is, the net helping payment gave/given to) the 
 ADBP can be used to represent the costs of formal 
 lenders. 
 The payments to the ADBP come from interest-free 
 grants and givebackary money (that are received/got at 
 below-market interest rates). The helping payment from givebackal money is defined as the difference between 
 the market interest rate (which is the opportunity cost 
 of the give money tod money) and the actual interest rate 
 times the total value of the money. Since no interest 
 is charged on grants, the helping payment from grants is the 
 market interest rate times the grant amount. The total helping payment gave/given to the ADBP is the sum of these 
 
 207 
 
 two payments plus equity helping payment calculated from once-a-year equity. The net helping payment is the helping payment after the 
 (money made/good thing received) is netted out. As Table ll shows, the net helping payment of ADBP increased from 1685 million rupees in 
 1991 to 3312 million rupees in 1995 (Qureshi et al., 
 1999). This increase was due to the increase in borrowing money and equity that happened while interest 
 rates remained mostly constant. The average helping payment 
 was 4.7% of the loans outstanding in 1991 and 7.5% 
 in 1995. 15 
 The (in name only/very small amount) interest rate of ADBP loans increased 
 (a) little from 1991 to 1995 and from 12.5 to 13.5%. 
 The rate of inflation during this period increased from 
 9.6% in 1991 to 13.9% in 1993, and then decreased to 
 10.4% in 1995. The data clearly show that the real rate 
 of interest on an ADBP loan was negative for most of 
 the time during the study period. So one way of reducing the helping payment dependence of the ADBP would be to 
 increase the (in name only/very small amount) interest rate it changes. To decide/figure out how much the (in name only/very small amount) rate of interest would 
 have to be increased to eliminate the helping payment, we use 
 the helping payment dependence index (SDI) measure (Yaron, 
 1992). The SDI is expressed as the net helping payment (total 
 helping payment less accounting (money made/good thing received)) as a percentage of interest income received from on-lending (which is in tum 
 defined as the average loan outstanding times the (in name only/very small amount) interest rate). The SDI measures the percentage increase in the average on-lending interest rate needed/demanded 
 to eliminate all payments in a given year while keeping the return on equity equal to the non-giveback 
 borrowing cost. Between 1991 and 1995, the SDI increased from 0.38 to 0.56. So, in order to eliminate 
 helping payment it receives, the ADBP would have had to increase the on-lending interest rate by 38% in 1991 
 and by 56% in 1995. Using the (in name only/very small amount) rate for those 
 years, this means that the (in name only/very small amount) rate should have 
 increased from 12.5 to 17.2% in 1991 and from 13.5 
 to 21% in 1995. 
 Another way of reducing helping payment dependence is to 
 improve the loan recovery rate. Loan recovery has 
 been a major concern for all government-run credit 
 
 15 The helping payment gave/given to the ADBP is similar with that 
 of other successful banks around the world. For 
 example, the Grameen Bank of Bangladesh, which is a role model 
 for micro-credit programs worldwide, enjoyed a helping payment rate of 
 5.6% in 1994 (Khandker, 1988). But unlike the Grameen Bank, 
 ADBP loans are received mostly by large landholders.

 The ADBPs loan recovery rate was 59% in 1991 for 
 all past loans and (lowered in number/got worse/gotten worse) further to 45% in 1996 
 (Table 12). Most interestingly, as we found earlier, the 
 bulk of ADBP loans are received by large landowners, who are usually able to pay back the loan. Yet 
 because of their political punch/power they do not repay in 
 many cases and get away with it. As a result, the loan 
 recovery of the state-controlled ADBP has suffered 
 a lot. 
 A final way of reducing the helping payment dependence of 
 the ADBP is to make it more dependent on its own 
 useful things/valuable supplies for lending, (in other words) to require it to get ready 
 savings to support its lending. This savings-based 
 lending practice would make it more responsible 
 for its loan payment, repayment and the cost 
 of operation. From 1991 to 1996, the ADBPs savings and deposits accounted for only 23% of its loan

 7. Cost-effectiveness of the ADBP 
 If the helping payment dependence of the ADBP cannot be 
 fully avoided, can it be reasonable in terms of the social 
 benefits that it creates? We have discovered that 
 the ADBP is not a (producing a lot for a given amount of money) delivery system as 
 it depends on payments. (even though there is the existence of) the high loan default 
 costs and helping payment dependence, it is important to find 
 out whether it is (producing a lot with very little waste) from the point of view of the 
 social goal to deliver targeted credit. Since the 
 delivery of farm credit clearly shows/includes government policies, 
 it is worth exploring whether it is (producing a lot for a given amount of money) to<p><strong>NOTE: This document is incomplete. It was shortened to the maximum document length of 50,000 characters.</strong></p><div style="clear:both">&nbsp;</div>
