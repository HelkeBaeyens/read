 Abstract 
 Previous studies on (the health of the Earth/the surrounding conditions)al hits/effects of bug-killer use have tended to focus either on measuring damages through 
 changes in relative risks to different (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) categories or examining the trade-off between bug-killer use levels and 
 stopping costs. This study uses the physical risk test approach combined with contingent (putting a value on something) survey results on 
 people' desire to reduce bug-killer risk. The reduction in external costs connected with the changes in bug-killer use 
 in Ontario farming between 1983 and 1998 is US$_$ 188 per household. (the health of the Earth/the surrounding conditions)al benefits are mostly due to the 
 reduction in the level of high and moderate-risk bug-killers. Â© 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

 1. Introduction 
 The intensive use of bug-killers in farming has 
 increased (a lot) farming-based working well. The 
 on-farm benefits of bug-killer use are off-set to some 
 degree by the off-farm costs (forced (on people)/caused an inconvenient situation) by these bug-killers on the health of the Earth/the surrounding conditions. (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) contamination from bug-killers ranges from the disruption of 
 natural water, air and soil functions, to the change 
 of the community resulting in harmful affects on 
 nutrient cycles, or the poisonous quality of non-target organisms. Concerns over these (effects on the surrounding conditions or on the health of the Earth) 
 have led to policy efforts ranging from moral suasion

 to rules to money-based legal documents, all designed 
 to reduce bug-killer use. Sound policy design needs/demands 
 an test of the benefits from a reduction in the 
 amount of bug-killer applied. 
 Approaches to testing the money-based effects of 
 reducing bug-killer use, specifically through integrated 
 pest management, have been reviewed (not very long ago) by 
 Swinton and Williams (1998). (the health of the Earth/the surrounding conditions)al hits/effects of bug-killer use are commonly proxied through 
 (numbers that change/things that change) such as pounds of active ingredient (a.i.) 
 applied or dollars spent on bug-killers. Both measures 
 assume that (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) damage is directly related to the amount of bug-killer used, (without any concern about/having nothing to do with) 
 the clearly stated/particular chemical and creation. Given the costs 
 of watching and measuring the extent of damages, 
 it is impossible to correctly decide/figure out the actual 
 damages of bug-killer use. Instead, damages have been 
 measured through changes in the relative risks to a 
 series of (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) and human health categories.

 An example is the work by Kovach et al. (1992) who 
 developed (the health of the Earth/the surrounding conditions)al hit/effect quotient (EIQ) 
 to decide/figure out the risk of bug-killers to the health of the Earth/the surrounding conditions. The EIQ assigns a number to an a.i. based on 
 11 (features/ qualities/ traits) of the ingredient in order to calculate (the health of the Earth/the surrounding conditions)al parts/pieces of the indices. 
 Higley and Wintersteen (1992) followed by Mullen 
 et al. (1997) used eight separate judging requirements to describe (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) risk from insecticides, herbicides 
 and fungus-killers in calculating their surrounding conditionsally 
 (changed to make better/changed to fit new conditions) EIQs. Hoag and Hornsby (1992), Teague 
 et al. (1995), and Crissman et al. (1998) included 
 site-clearly stated/particular judging requirements in guessing (effects on the surrounding conditions or on the health of the Earth) or risks from bug-killers. Hoag and Hornsby 
 (1992) developed a trade-off edge of something/unexplored area for bug-killer 
 costs and a ground water danger-related index. The judging requirements 
 included bug-killer specific and site-clearly stated/particular judging requirements 
 that could affect the chance of ground water contamination. Teague et al. (1995) compared the EIQ 
 with site-specific guesses of (the health of the Earth/the surrounding conditions)al future 
 of bug-killers, in addition to the poisonous quality and leakability measures in the EIQ. Crissman et al. (1998) also 
 included site-clearly stated/particular information on soil types and 
 rainfall in their measure of bug-killer leaking risk. 
 While these studies think about/believe (the health of the Earth/the surrounding conditions)al hits/effects and farm stopping costs of reducing risks, little 
 has been done on the money-based test of these 
 hits/effects. 
 The purpose of this paper is to identify the value 
 of (things that are good for the planet) connected with changes in 
 the levels and types of bug-killers applied in Ontario 
 farming. The approach is just like that developed 
 by Mullen et al. (1997) who extended the physical 
 risk test by incorporating a contingent (putting a value on something) survey to decide/figure out people' desire to 
 pay (CWP) for reductions in bug-killer risk to different 
 parts/pieces of the health of the Earth/the surrounding conditions. The paper begins by 
 describing the method for assigning levels of relative 
 risk to the pesticidal a.i.s for eight (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) categories. The approach for valuing the changes in risk 
 from bug-killer use are then described. The changes 
 in bug-killer risk to (the health of the Earth/the surrounding conditions) from 1983 to 
 1998 are then organized and listed for all of Ontario farming. 
 The money-based value of changes in risks for the eight 
 (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) categories are then described by time 
 period and by risk level. Factors adding/giving to the 
 changes and later policy effects/results/suggestions are then 
 discussed. 
 
 2. Methods 
 2.1. Identifying changes in bug-killer risk to the 
 (surrounding conditions) 
 The (possibility of/possible happening of)  a bug-killer to cause external damage costs (risk) is measured using an approach developed by Mullen et al. (1997). Rather than assume 
 the amount applied is an correct substitute for risk, the 
 approach recognises that risks change/differ  with bug-killers 
 depending on their poisonous quality, ability to move around and toughness. 
 Mullen et al. (1997) develop a set of judging requirements for assigning levels of relative risk to pesticidal a.i.s for 
 eight (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) and human health categories; 
 ground water, surface water, sudden human health, 
 long-lasting human health, water-based species, birds, (milk-producing animals), and insects. Each a.i. was assigned a risk 
 level of high, (not an extreme person), or low for each (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) category. For example, atrazine is categorised as 
 a high (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) risk to ground water, a medium 
 risk to surface water, water-based species, sudden and 
 long-lasting health, and a low-risk to birds, (milk-producing animals) and 
 non-target organisms. A list of the risk levels created by/presented by 
 all the bug-killers used in Ontario for each of the eight 
 categories is available from the authors upon request. 
 The approach this way permits the measurement of the 
 change in total kilograms of bug-killer within each of 
 the 24 risk per (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) classes (the three levels 
 of risk for each of the eight (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) categories). 
 For example, the 585,208 kg of atrazine a.i. applied to 
 corn in 1993 were set apart and given out to the appropriate risk per 
 (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) classes as defined above. The amount 
 of each bug-killer applied was (in almost the same way) gave out. The 
 total amounts for all bug-killers for each class were 
 then summed to decide/figure out the total high, medium and 
 low-risk per (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) category per survey year. 
 This total within a given (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth)/risk category 
 can be expressed as 
 K

 Lpijk, Vi 
 
 = 
 
 1, 2, ... , 8 and j 
 
 = 
 
 1-3 
 
 (1) 
 
 k=l 
 
 where UseiJ is the amount of a.i. (kg) applied from all 
 bug-killers in (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) category i and risk level 
 j; Pijk the amount (kg) of bug-killer k applied that is a 
 risk level j to (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) category i, and K is the 
 total number of bug-killers applied. Note that, the total 
 amount of bug-killer applied in a year (total) equals the 
 
 C. Brethour, A. Weersink/Agricultural Money flow 25 (2001) 219-226 
 
 sum of the amount of a.i. across the three risk levels 
 for each (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) category 
 3 
 
 Total= LUseij, 
 
 Vi= 1, 2, 3, ... , 8. 
 
 (2) 
 
 j=l 
 
 Once the total level of risk is serious and stubborn in kilograms of a.i. per risk category for each (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) 
 category i and each risk level j (Useii ), it is possible 
 to decide/figure out the change in risk from year to year. 
 
 important they felt it was to avoid a given level of 
 risk with each of the eight (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) categories 
 through a six-point Likert scale ranking (0 = not important at all and 6 = very important). This rating was 
 completed for each of the three risk levels. The importance of reducing risk for each category was then 
 used to guess  the person who responded's WTP for a reduction 
 in risk j for each (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) category i by taking 
 the Likert scale rating for that category (importance;) 
 and dividing it by the sum of the ratings for all 
 categories

 importance; 
 
 WTPu = 
 While the change in risk from bug-killer use can be 
 tested by comparing the amount of bug-killer applied 
 within each risk level across years, this would not account for the greater benefits attached to a reduction 
 in high against/compared to/or low-risk bug-killer use. One method to 
 weight, the changes in use for different risk levels 
 is to assign money-based values to these changes. Since 
 reducing bug-killer risk is not a market valuable thing, 
 the value of the changes in (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) risk connected with changes in bug-killer use must be guessed 
 through a non-market (putting a value on something) way of doing things. The guesses used in this study are based on the results of 
 a contingent (putting a value on something) survey given to a random sample of 3000 families in the United States 
 by Mullen et al. (1997). The list of questions began by 
 asking for the person who responded's monthly grocery bill followed by questions on the person's desire to 
 pay to avoid a given level of risk to (the health of the Earth/the surrounding conditions) 
 and human health through an increase in that grocery 
 bill. The people who responded were asked to show their desire to pay for each of the three risk levels (WTPj, 
 j = 1-3) rather than their WTP for a reduction in risk 
 for each of the eight (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) categories with 
 each risk level (WTPij ). So, the received/got WTP j for 
 WTPij is assumed to be the sum of the WTP to reduce 
 risk within each (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) category. However, the 
 three WTP j values were not split equally among the 
 eight (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) categories since is it is assumed 
 that reducing bug-killer use that is high-risk to humans, 
 for example, is valued more than a similar reduction in bug-killer use that is high-risk to insects. 
 The showed/told about WTP j values were used to guess  the 
 eight WTPij values for that risk level through a ranking that the people assigned to (the health of the Earth/the surrounding conditions)al 
 categories. People who responded were asked to identify how 
 
 221

 . 
 
 x WTPj, 
 
 Li=IImportance; 
 Vi=l,2, ... ,8 
 
 (3) 
 
 So, if all (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) categories were thought of 
 equally important, the showed/told about WTP for a risk level 
 would be divided equally between the eight categories. 
 The WTP values received/got by Mullen et al. were (changed to make better/changed to fit new conditions) to reflect Ontario conditions by using Ontario 
 average income values and converting into Canadian 
 dollars. The resulting guesses are listed in Table 1. 
 With the WTPij, the value from changes in (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) bug-killer risks per individual can then be 
 tested using the following equation:

 So, the value of the risk reduction in period t 
 is equal to the percentage change in the amount of

 a.i. connected with each risk level j and for each 
 (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) category I (l- (Useijt!USei}t-d) multiplied by the similar value for the person's 
 WTPij. Decreases (increases) in usage for any (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth)/risk category will reduce (increase) the 
 (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) risk costs. However, savings can be 
 created even if there is no change in total bug-killer 
 use between periods, if there is a relative change in the 
 level of risks created by/presented by the same amount of a.i. For example, benefits are created if there is a move/change toward 
 low-risk bug-killers and away from high-risk ones, 
 since the WTP values are higher for high-risk than for 
 low-risk uses. (in almost the same way), a reduction in the dollar value of (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) risk happens if the relative changes happen for an (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) category for 
 which the WTP is high. The approach does not account 
 for the total level of bug-killer use so that a (fair in amount, related to something else/properly sized compared to something else) reduction of bug-killers when a large amount is 
 applied is valued the same as when the total amount of 
 use is small. The approach assumes a linear relationship between the percentage risk reduction and actual 
 risk eliminated within each category since, WTP values are based on how much people would be willing to pay to avoid a risk while the actual changes in 
 bug-killer use result in only a fraction of the risk being 
 eliminated. 
 
 3. Data and results 
 3.1. Data 
 
 The Ontario Ministry of Farming Food and (away from cities) Affairs has surveyed growers every five years since 
 1973 to collect a record of the use of herbicides, 
 insecticides, and fungus-killers in Ontario crop production. The survey collects the area of each crop grown 
 ((anyway/in any event) of whether it was sprayed or not), the 
 amount of product applied to an area, the number of 
 times a crop is sprayed, and its PCP number that points to/shows the strength of the product and the multiple 
 a.i.s in the case of mixtures. The individual grower 
 data is then grouped up to the county and (related to a local area) level based on production shares. This publicly 
 available, grouped data is used in this study to 
 compare changes in use patterns and to document 
 progress made in bug-killer and (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) risk 
 reduction. 
 
 3.2. Results 
 3.2.1. Changes in bug-killer risk to (the health of the Earth/the surrounding conditions) 
 The total amount of bug-killers applied in Ontario 
 has (lowered in number/got worse/gotten worse) about 40% from 8.8 million kg 
 of a.i. in 1983 to 5.2 million kg of a.i. in 1998 (Table 2). 
 The change in the total amount of bug-killer use was 
 connected mostly with a decrease in application rates. 
 Some of the reduced rate (9%) is indirectly attributable 
 to a government program called Food Systems 2002. 
 This program gave money (to) research and educational activities into bug-killer management with the goal of 
 reducing bug-killer use in the area of control/area of land of Ontario by 
 50% over a 15-year-period ending in 2002. However, 
 the decrease in the total amount applied is due mostly 
 to two major changes in production practices related 
 to bug-killers during this period. The first change was 
 a 20% reduction in the total area of land farmed, and 
 the second was a move/change in cropping patterns from corn 
 to soybeans. Soybeans generally require less herbicide 
 than corn and the increased use of a com-soybean rotation reduced the need for insecticide compared with 
 continuous com. 
 The amount and share of the once-a-year total amount 
 applied classified by risk level are given for the eight 
 (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) categories in Table 2. Most 
 the bug-killers applied are not carefully thought about/believed high-risk for 
 any of (the health of the Earth/the surrounding conditions)al groupings. In 1983, high-risk 
 bug-killers represented more than one-quarter of the 
 total amount applied for only the ground water and 
 long-lasting human categories. The total amount and share 
 of bug-killers that are high-risk for these categories 
 declined over time, especially in terms of long-lasting 
 human effects. However, there has been an increase 
 in the relative share of total bug-killers applied that 
 represent a high-risk to water-based species, surface water and acute human categories. The share of the total applied that is high-risk for these groupings is about 20%. This increase in the relative share 
 of high-risk bug-killers for these three (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) categories came as a result of a decrease in the 
 amount of moderate-risk bug-killers applied. For all 
 categories, with the exception of insects, the total 
 amount of bug-killers that are moderate-risk has fallen 
 significantly in both total amounts and as a share 
 of the total. Yet around half of all bug-killers applied 
 are carefully thought about/believed moderate-risk to surface water, water-based 
 species, and long-lasting human categories. For the last

 Average 
 
 three categories in Table 2, bird-related species, mammalian 
 species and insects, most bug-killers applied continues to present/cause a low-risk. 
 The percentage changes in the amount of bug-killer 
 applied by risk category between 1983 and 1998 are 
 listed in Table 3. The percentage changes are important for the (putting a value on something) exercise to follow as the WTP 
 values refer to the complete elimination of risk. The 
 (figuring out how much money something is worth) multiply the WTP values (Table l) by these 
 percentage changes as noted in Eq. (4). There has been 
 big reduction in the total amount of bug-killer that is carefully thought about/believed high and moderate-risk for most 
 of (the health of the Earth/the surrounding conditions)al categories. The amount of bug-killer that is high-risk for surface water and acute human categories has increased between 1983 and 1998 
 by 67 and 31%, (match up each pair of items in order). While, the percentage 
 increases are significant, the total amount still represents less than one-third of the total amount of bug-killer applied by risk category. The use of moderate-risk 
 
 bug-killers fell for all (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) categories except 
 insects. As discussed above, most of the 
 bug-killers applied are carefully thought about/believed low-risk for this category. The amount that is moderate-risk for insects 
 increased from 0.19 million kg of a.i. in 1983 to 0.69 
 million kg of a.i. in 1998 but this amount represents 
 13% of the total applied. In summary, most of the 40% 
 decrease in the total amount applied between 1983 and 
 1998 is due to a decrease in high and moderate-risk 
 bug-killers for most of (the health of the Earth/the surrounding conditions)al categories. 
 
 3.2.2. (putting a value on something) of changes in (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) risk 
 The values of the changes in (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) risks 
 created by/presented by bug-killers in Ontario tested using Eq. (4) 
 are listed in Table 4. The values point to/show the amount an 
 average household would be willing to pay every year 
 to experience the percentage change in (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) 
 risk watched/followed for each time period. The reduction in 
 external costs connected with the changes in bug-killer 
 use between 1983 and 1998 is US$_$ 188 per household 
 every year. Since the total number of families in Ontario in 1993 was 3,781,440, the value of (the health of the Earth/the surrounding conditions)al risk reduction for the whole area of control/area of land over the 
 last 15 years was 711 million (Canadian)$_$. 
 The largest reduction happened in the last 5-yearperiod with mostly no benefits connected with 
 changes between 1988 and 1993. The value of the 
 change in bug-killer risk was greatest between 1993 
 and 1998 since the changes in risk were positive for 
 all eight (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) categories. The largest benefits built up (match up each pair of items in order) to mammalian species, bird-related 
 species, long-lasting human, ground water and water-based 
 species. These results are due to the large percentage 
 reduction in the total amount of bug-killer applied

 Total change 
 
 that is carefully thought about/believed high-risk to these categories and 
 the greater value placed by families on a percentage reduction in high-risk bug-killers. The external 
 costs of bug-killers did increase over the whole time 
 period for surface water and insects, especially 
 between 1988 and 1993. The negative value for the 
 change in (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) risk for surface water was 
 due to the increase in the amount of low and high-risk 
 bug-killer applied which more than offset the large decrease in the total amount of bug-killer thought about/believed 
 moderate-risk for this category. For insects, most 
 of the bug-killer applied is carefully thought about/believed as low-risk. 
 Although, this total fell significantly, a (compared to other things) 
 large percentage increase in the amount of medium 
 risk bug-killer applied (see Table 3) accounts for the 
 negative value change. 
 The values of the changes in (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) risks 
 for the period 1983-1998 (last column of Table 4) are 
 rotten by risk category in Table 5. The results 
 focuse that (the health of the Earth/the surrounding conditions)al benefits are due to 
 the reduction in the level of high and moderate-risk 
 bug-killers (Table 5). Most categories experienced a 
 reduction in the external costs from changes in the 
 levels of bug-killers that are carefully thought about/believed high-risk for 
 that category. Exceptions are the surface water and 
 acute human categories for which the external costs 
 per household increased by US$_$ 51 and 22, (match up each pair of items in order). Only for the insect category was there an 
 increase in the external costs due to changes in the 
 use of bug-killers thought about/believed moderate-risk as noted 
 above. The overall external costs of low-risk bug-killer 
 use have increased since 1983 due to the increase in 
 use of these bug-killers for four (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) categories (ground water, surface water, sudden human, and 
 
 long-lasting human). However, for all these categories except surface water, the increase in cost connected with 
 increased low-risk bug-killer use is smaller than (the health of the Earth/the surrounding conditions)al benefits that result from the reduced use 
 of bug-killers thought about/believed to be high or moderate-risk. 
 
 4. Ends/end results 
 Designing sound policies to reduce bug-killer use needs/demands an test of (the health of the Earth/the surrounding conditions)al benefits that 
 can be compared with the stopping costs for bug-killer users and the (related to managing and running a company or organization) costs of enforcing the 
 policy. Previous studies of (the health of the Earth/the surrounding conditions)al hits/effects 
 of bug-killer use have tended to focus either on measming damages through changes in relative risks to 
 different (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) categories on or examining the 
 trade-off between bug-killer use levels and stopping 
 costs. This study uses the physical risk test 
 approach combined with contingent (putting a value on something) survey 
 results on consumer's desire to reduce bug-killer 
 risk. The method developed by Mullen et al. ( 1997) 
 is used to identify the value of (things that are good for the planet) 
 from changes in the level and types of bug-killers applied in Ontario farming. The total amount of bug-killers applied in Ontario has (lowered in number/got worse/gotten worse) about 
 40% from 8.8 million kg of a.i. in 1983 to 5.2 million 
 kg of a.i. in 1998. Only for the surface water category 
 were high-risk bug-killers more than one-quarter of the 
 total amount applied in 1998. The total amount and 
 share of bug-killers that are high-risk for most (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) categories (lowered in number/got worse/gotten worse) over time, especially in 
 terms of long-lasting human and mammalian species effects. There was a almost the same  decrease in the amount of 
 bug-killers used that are carefully thought about/believed moderate-risk with 
 
 226

 the exception of the insect (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) category. 
 The reduction in total amount applied is due mostly to 
 the reduction in high and moderate-risk categories as 
 the percentage change in low-risk bug-killer use averaged to zero across the eight (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) groups. 
 The reduction in external costs connected with 
 the changes in bug-killer use between 1983 and 1998 
 is US$_$ 188 per household every year, which represents a value of US$_$ 711 million for the area of control/area of land 
 as a whole. Once again, (the health of the Earth/the surrounding conditions)al benefits can be attributed to the reduction in the level 
 of high and moderate-risk bug-killer use. The percentage decreases noted for the total amount applied 
 are weighted by the desire to pay to eliminate risks, with higher values connected with higher 
 risks. In most cases, the categories experienced a 
 reduction in external costs due to reductions in the 
 use of bug-killers that are carefully thought about/believed high-risk. Over 
 70% of the total value connected with the reduction in (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) risk is due to the reduction of 
 high-risk bug-killer use. The overall external costs of 
 low-risk bug-killers have increased since 1983 due 
 to the increase in use of these bug-killers in the categories ground water, surface water and sudden and 
 long-lasting human health. However, this small increase 
 in cost connected with increased low-risk bug-killer 
 use is still significantly smaller than the value of the 
 
 (things that are good for the planet) that results from the reduced 
 use of bug-killers thought about/believed high and moderate-risk.
