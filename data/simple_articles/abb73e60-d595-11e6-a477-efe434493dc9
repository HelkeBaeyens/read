 ABSTRACT 
 Zuhair, S.M.M., Taylor, D.B. and Kramer, R.A., 1992. Choice of utility function form: its 
 effect on classification of risk preferences and the (statement about the future) of farmer decisions. Agric. 
 Econ., 6: 333-344. 
 In applications of expected utility analysis, (people who work to find information) are argued with with a choice 
 among a few utility functional forms. (not definite) utility values and chance distributions 
 for price and yield were brought out from Sri Skinnyan producers of minor export crops. 
 Huge quadratic and cubic utility functions were guessed. The choice of functional 
 form was found to affect both the classification of risk attitudes and the (statement about the future) of 
 collecting plan. The huge function was the best (describe the future)or of collecting plan 
 because it was the best (describe the future)or of mature collecting. All three functions were equally 
 poor (describe the future)ors of (too) early or soon collecting. 
 
 INTRODUCTION 
 
 A critical step in many applications of decision analysis under the 
 expected utility guess is the (detailed description of exactly what is required) and guess of a good 
 utility function. For this purpose, a few functional forms have been used

 in scientific studies (Halter and Dean, 1971; Lin et al., 1974; Lin and 
 Chang, 1978; Musser et al., 1984). (people who work to find information) generally agree that utility 
 functions should possess some desirable properties such as (unbroken, constant quality) and 
 decreasing total risk disgust. However, beyond that, there is little 
 guidance for (people who work to find information) to use in selecting functional forms. Using data 
 collected from Sri Skinnyan farmers, this study first compares the risk 
 attitudes suggested by quadratic, huge, and cubic utility functions. 
 Then an (act of asking questions and trying to find the truth about something) is made of whether or not the ranking of prospects is 
 independent of the utility functional form. 
 Many studies have randomly chosen a particular functional form and 
 then went ahead with the analysis. In one test of functional forms, 
 Lin and Chang (1978) criticized the forms usually employed because all 
 forms require certain (serving to severely limit or control) good  ideas (you think are true). These authors suggested a Box-Cox change as a means of deciding/figuring out the form of 
 the function rather than assuming it. (even though there is the existence of) the appeal of this approach, 
 Buccola (1982a) later (showed/shown or proved) that the Box-Cox change is not 
 agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with Bernoullian decision explanation. 
 Musser et al. (1984) have shown that the choice of functional form is 
 critical because it can affect the classification of decision makers based on 
 their risk attitudes. Musser et al. (1984) classified twelve graduate students 
 in their study using the second almost the same as the utility function as a 
 measure of risk disgust. The utility functions used were quadratic (U =a 
 + bx- cx 2 ), semi-log (U =a+ b In x), and non-linear (U =a+ bxc). The 
 quadratic function classified three subjects as risk-preferring and the rest 
 as risk-uncaring. The semi-log function classified all subjects as riskaverse, and the non-linear function classified all subjects as risk-uncaring. 
 (without any concern about/having nothing to do with) the specific functional form chosen, certain properties are 
 desirable in a functional form. Important ones include: strictly positive 
 not important utility of income, the ease of guessing the limits/guidelines of the 
 function, the ease with which the function can be mathematically moved around/misled and tricked to decide/figure out summary measures such as the mean and variance, and 
 the behavior of the measures of the risk disgust. In a perfect world, a utility function 
 also should show decreasing total risk disgust with respect to increasing wealth. Of the functional forms suggested in the books, the 
 quadratic and the huge seem to be the most popular. 
 Carefully studying a California farmer's marketing problem, Buccola (1982b), 
 assuming a (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) distribution of returns, reported that quadratic and 
 huge functions gave the same best (mix of stocks, bonds, etc./document collection) if and only if there 
 was no more than one linear restriction influencing the decision making 
 and both functions had the same total risk disgust coefficients at the 
 best solution. Hanoch and Levy (1970), in a possible comparison of 
 quadratic and cubic functions, decided that the cubic function has 
 
 CHOICE OF UTILITY FUNCTION FORM

 certain properties which are preferred to those of the quadratic function. 
 These properties are: (1) expected utility depends on the third moment of 
 the distribution, skewness; (2) this added limit/guideline results in greater 
 flexibility and better comes close to the general utility function; (3) within 
 certain restrictions on the coefficient, it is monotonically increasing; (4) it 
 shows a decreasing degree of risk disgust at certain (between beginner and expert) levels; 
 and (5) it allows for risk preference (curviness) at certain periods of time (or space) of high 
 returns. The arguments for the cubic utility function, therefore, rest on the 
 idea (you think is true) of non-(usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) returns or non-zero skewness. 
 ALTERNATIVE FUNCTIONAL FORMS FOR UTILITY 
 
 In all the utility functional forms discussed, U will refer to the utility 
 index and x to the money-based measure. In this article income will be in Sri 
 Skinnyan Rupees (Rs.). At the time of the study, US$1 was equal to 26.28 
 Rs. The quadratic utility function (ouF) can be represented as: 
 (1) 
 
 U=a +bx +cx 2 
 
 where a, b, and c are limits/guidelines. If the second almost the same as the function, 
 2c, is less than zero then reducing not important utility is suggested over the 
 whole range of x, this way ruling out risk-preferring behavior. If it is positive, 
 however, the individual would be classified as risk-preferring over the 
 whole range of income. The Arrow-Pratt total risk disgust coefficient, 
 Ra, for the QUF is given by: 
 2c 
 
 R 
 
 (2) 
 
 =&mdash; 
 
 a 
 
 b 
 
 + 2cx 
 
 Function (2) will remain positive for x &amp;lt; (b j2c). As a result, within this 
 range of x, the quadratic function will show increasing risk disgust, and 
 for values of x &amp;gt; (b j2c), the function will show decreasing risk disgust. 
 The huge utility function (EUF) can be represented as: 
 U = K- 
 
 ee -Ax 
 
 for K, (), A &amp;gt; 0 
 
 (3) 
 
 where, K and () are limits/guidelines and e is the base of natural logarithms. 
 The second almost the same as the function is: 
 
 (4) 
 suggesting reducing not important utility. The Arrow-Pratt total risk disgust coefficient, Ra, is A, which is positive and constant. The huge 
 utility function, therefore, shows constant risk disgust over all levels of 
 net returns, which can be argued is one of its major limits. 
 
 336 
 
 S.M.M. ZUHAIR ET AL. 
 
 The cubic utility function (cuF) can be expressed as: 
 
 (5) 
 U = a + bx + ex 2 + d.x 3 
 where a, b, c, and d are limits/guidelines. The second derivative is given by 
 2c + 6d.x, the sign of which depends on the sign and the importance of the 
 limits/guidelines c, d, and the level of income, x. This way increasing and decreasing not important utility are both possible. The Arrow-Pratt total risk 
 disgust coefficient for the cuF is: 
 Ra = - 
 
 [_( 
 
 2c + 6d.x 
 ]_) 
 2 
 b + 2cx + 3d.x 
 
 (6) 
 
 The Ra this way can be positive or negative depending on the limit/guideline values 
 and income at which equation (6) is tested. 
 METHODS AND DATA 
 
 The data used in this paper were gotten as part of a complete 
 study of the decision making of Sri Skinnyan farmers who produce minor 
 export crops (MEP). The minor export crops thought about/believed in this study were 
 cocoa, coffee, pepper, cardamons, and nutmeg. A few other crops, mostly spices and vegetables, also are referred to as minor export crops in 
 Sri Skinnya, but were not thought about/believed in this study. The clearly stated/particular decision 
 which the study examined was the collecting behavior of these farmers. 
 The farmers often harvest their crops (before it should) due to fear of theft, 
 damage by insects, cash needs, and other factors. The study developed 
 methods to (describe the future) whether farmers would harvest maturely or (before it should). One of the methods used brought-out utility functions to compare the 
 income earned from (too) early or soon collecting with the income earned in a 
 future period from mature collecting. 
 The data were collected through two farm surveys in the districts of 
 Kandy and Matale in the central area of control/area of land of Sri Skinnya. The surveys were 
 conducted between December 1985 and February 1986. The sample size of 
 the first survey was 240, with an equal number from each district. The first 
 survey was used to collect general information about farms in the two 
 districts. Using the electoral people (who vote)' register as a sampling frame, farm 
 families were sampled randomly. 
 A second survey was managed and did/done among 30 farmers selected at random 
 from the larger sample of 240 farmers. The second survey collected more 
 described/explained information about decision making activities on the farm, with the 
 chief decision maker as the unit of question (or investigation). This survey included bring outation 
 of (not definite) utility functions and chance distributions. 
 Direct bring outation of utility functions does have its people (who say bad things or give opinions), but direct 
 bring outation has (large/relatively large) appeal from an scientific (way of seeing things / sensible view of what is and is not important) (Robin- 
 
 CHOICE OF UTILITY FUNCTION FORM 
 
 337 
 
 son et al., 1984). The two most widely used direct bring outation methods for 
 utility are the Ramsey method and the changed Von Neumann-Morgenstern method (1953). The Ramsey method brings out sure feeling equals for 
 a few risky other choices. The changed Von Neumann-Morgenstern 
 method brings out sure feeling equals for a series of lotteries. The changed 
 Von Neumann-Morgenstern method was thought of appropriate for this 
 study in view of its ease of use (Anderson et al., 1977) and its proven 
 effectiveness in Sri Skinnya in a previous study (Herath et al., 1982). 
 Using the changed Von Neumann-Morgenstern method as organized and listed in 
 Anderson et al. (1977, p. 72), utility values were brought out for a range of 
 incomes. This range was established for each individual farmer to go along with/match up to the possible farm income levels which could be experienced by 
 that farmer. The upper value of the range was the net family income from 
 farm and off-farm activities reported in the first survey. The lower value of 
 the range was selected to be a negative 20% of the reported net family 
 income. A negative value was selected for the lower range to allow utility 
 guess over losses as well as gains. Interviews were managed and did/done by 
 graduate students in farming-based money flow/money-based studies at the University of Peradeniya, who were trained in interviewing ways of doing things by the senior author. 
 Binswanger (1980), in discussing the work of Dillon and Scandizzo (1978), 
 argued that the bring outation of utility functions can be subject to interviewer 
 bias. However, since the purpose of this paper is to compare the effects/results/suggestions of different functional forms for the information received/got by one 
 interviewer per farmer, this concern is not clearly connected with or related to this analysis. That is, 
 the comparisons in this study are across functional forms for a given farmer 
 rather than across farmers. 
 (not definite) chance distributions were brought out from 30 growers for 
 prices and yields of the minor export crops. A changed triangular distribution method was used to bring out 5th, 50th and 95th percentiles of the 
 distributions (Moskowitz and Bullers, 1979). The faults/problems of this 
 limited information procedure are recognized (Spetzler and Stael Von 
 Holstein, 1975), but the method was chosen because of the speed with 
 which it can be given. This was an important thing to think about given 
 that 20 distributions were brought out from each farmer. Prices and yields were 
 tested independently because of the large number of growers and the 
 small size of Sri Skinnyan production relative to the world market. 
 To compare the relative performance of the three utility functions in 
 (describing the future) behavior, a Monte Carlo (testing out) model was built. The 
 model tested out net family income from farm and non-farm sources. 
 Income from minor export crops was treated as (random/including random data points) using the brought-out 
 chance distributions of prices and yields. Means and variances were 
 guessed by formulas given in Anderson et al. (1977), and a cut short 
 
 338 
 
 S.M.M. ZUHAIR ET AL. 
 
 (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) distribution was used to create 1000 random draws for each 
 minor export crop for each farmer. The cutting off was made to promise that 
 no negative prices or yields were created. The randomly created 
 income levels were then tested with the three fitted utility functions to 
 guess expected utility levels for the two collecting options. 
 UTILITY FUNCTION ESTIMATION 
 
 The quadratic (ouF) and cubic functions (cuF) were guessed for each 
 farmer by applying the method of ordinary least squares while the huge functions (EUF) were guessed by the method of maximum chance. For the huge functions, a set of limits/guidelines (K, e, and A) was 
 serious and stubborn for each function which (made small) the sum of squares of the 
 error terms. These guesses were used as the starting values in the 
 maximum chance method. Space limits prevent presentation of 
 the guessed functions. The reader is referred to Zuhair (1986) for 
 added/more details on the guess. 
 For the EUF, guesses of the Arrow-Pratt risk disgust coefficient, A, 
 were significant at least at the 0.05 level for all the farmers. For the QUF 
 and cuF, the risk disgust coefficients are non-linear functions of the utility 
 function's limits/guidelines; this way desire/decision of the level of importance of the 
 risk disgust coefficients for these functions was not possible. 
 For the QUF, the (changed to make better/changed to fit new conditions)-R 2 ranged from 0.80 to 0.99. With the 
 exception of one farmer's QUF, which was significant at 0.01 level, all the 
 other farmers' QUFS were significant at the 0.001 level, based on an F-test. 
 For the cuF, the (changed to make better/changed to fit new conditions)-R 2 ranged from 0.86 to 0.99. Based on an F-test, 
 the cuFs were significant at the 0.01 level for four farmers and at 0.001 for 
 the rest of the farmers. For the EUF, the (changed to make better/changed to fit new conditions)-R 2 ranged from 0.86 to 
 0.99. Comparing the (changed to make better/changed to fit new conditions)-R 2 across functions, the cuF gave the highest 
 (changed to make better/changed to fit new conditions)-R 2 for 14 farmers, the EUF for three farmers and the QUF for two 
 farmers. For four farmers, all three functions gave the same (changed to make better/changed to fit new conditions)-R 2 . 
 Four farmers had the same (changed to make better/changed to fit new conditions)-R 2 for the cuF and EUF, which was 
 higher than for their QUF. The QUF and the cuF were tied for highest 
 (changed to make better/changed to fit new conditions)-R 2 for two farmers, while the QUF and the EUF had the same 
 higher (changed to make better/changed to fit new conditions)-R 2 than the cuF for the remaining farmer. 
 FARMER RISK ATTITUDES 
 
 The Arrow-Pratt risk disgust coefficient, Ra, was figured out/calculated for each 
 farmer. The Ra, when figured out/calculated with the EUF is independent of the level of 
 income, while for the QUF and the cuF the Ra is a function of income. The 
 Ra was figured out/calculated at the midpoints of the income ranges used to bring out the 
 utility functions (Table 1).

 Ra &amp;gt; 0 means that the farmer is (not wanting to do anything dangerous) at this level of income, while Ra &amp;lt; 0 means that 
 the farmer is risk-preferring. The risk disgust coefficients were calculated for the quadratic 
 and cubic functions at the midpoints of the ranges used for each farmer to bring out his utility 
 function. For the huge function, Ra is independent of the level of income. 
 
 The EUF classified all farmers as (not wanting to do anything dangerous), Ra &amp;gt; 0. The Ra, as given by 
 ..\., ranged from 0.00001611 (farmer 8) to 0.00356840 (farmer 21). The QUF 
 classified 27 farmers as (not wanting to do anything dangerous) and three farmers as risk preferring at 
 the income midpoint. For the (not wanting to do anything dangerous) farmers, the Ra ranged from 
 0.00000551 (farmer 8) to 0.00407888 (farmer 21). The (not wanting to do anything dangerous) farmers 
 with the lowest and the highest Ra with the QUF at the income midpoint 
 
 340 
 
 S.M.M. ZUHAIR ET AL. 
 
 also had the lowest and highest Ra with the EUF. For farmers classified as 
 risk preferring by the QUF, the Ra at the income midpoint ranged from 
 - 0.00044156 (farmer 9) to -0.000050530 (farmer 25). 
 At the income midpoint, the cuF classified 15 farmers as (not wanting to do anything dangerous) and 
 15 farmers as risk-preferring. The Ra for (not wanting to do anything dangerous) farmers ranged from 
 0.0000006 (farmer 8) to 0.0009055 (farmer 26). Note that farmer number 8 
 had the lowest level of risk disgust with all three functions. For the 
 risk-preferring farmers, the Ra ranged from -0.0000130 (farmer 14) to 
 -0.0019286 (farmer 30). The three farmers classified as risk-preferring by 
 the QUF were also classified as risk-preferring by the cuF at their income 
 midpoint. Twelve of the farmers who were classified as (not wanting to do anything dangerous) by the 
 QUF were classified as risk-preferring by the cuF. 
 PREFERRED HARVESTING STRATEGIES 
 
 Table 2 gives indices of expected utility for the three utility functions 
 carefully studied with respect to income which could be earned from mature and 
 (too) early or soon collecting decisions. The guessed utility functions were used 
 to figure out/calculate  the expected utility of income under two collecting plans, 
 mature collecting (M) and (too) early or soon collecting (P). The income distribution from each other choice was figured out/calculated using a Monte Carlo (testing out) 
 model which sampled prices and yields from brought out (not definite) chance 
 distributions (Zuhair, 1986). The expected income created by the Monte 
 Carlo (testing out) fell within the income range used to bring out the utility 
 function for all but two farmers. In these two cases, the expected income 
 levels were less than 10 percent above the upper limit of the range. The 
 income range used to bring out the sure feeling equals for guess of the 
 utility functions this way was similar with the income resulting from the 
 Monte Carlo tests. 
 For the EUF, the utility index for Plan-M was higher than that of 
 Plan-P for 29 farmers. The QUF ranked Plan-M higher for 25 
 farmers and lower for five farmers. The cuF ranked Plan-M higher for 
 21 farmers and lower for nine farmers. The cuF, this way, preferred the (too) early or soon collecting plan for the largest number of farmers. 
 These results show that different utility functional forms can 
 have a different preference ordering for the same set of prospects. Comparing the EUF and the QUF, four reversals in ranking of the prospects are 
 watched/followed. Between the EUF and cuF there are eight reversals in ranking, 
 and between the QUF and cuF, six reversals happened. 
 The toughest test of functional form is how well the function (describes the future) 
 actual farmer behavior. In Table 3, 1985 watched/followed farmer behavior is 
 compared to the (described the future) behavior with respect to the mature against/compared to/or

 income from mature and (too) early or soon collecting of the MEC was employed 
 (Zuhair, 1986). The EUF, with 23 correct (statements about the future), did the best job of 
 (describing the future) actual behavior. The QUF was second with 19 correct (statements about the future), 
 while the cuF was last with 15 correct (statements about the future). With only one correct 
 (statement about the future) of (too) early or soon collecting by each utility function, all three 
 functions did a better job of (describing the future) mature collecting than (too) early or soon 
 collecting. That (statements about the future) were better for mature collecting may, at least

 in part, be due to the sample containing only eight actual (too) early or soon

 CHOICE OF UTILITY FUNCTION FORM 
 
 343 
 
 some other form of utility function would be more appropriate for these 
 people. 
 It should be noted that a stronger test of these utility functions would 
 have been to compare them to watched/followed behavior in later years since 
 the (described the future) behavior represents a long term average behavior decided/figured out 
 from the results of the Monte Carlo (testing out). This test, however, was 
 beyond the extent of/the range of the study. 
 CONCLUSIONS 
 
 This study has (showed/shown or proved) that the choice of a utility function is an 
 important aspect of the way(s) of doing things of applying expected utility explanation. 
 The importance of choosing the right/the proper utility function cannot be over 
 focused on. Depending on the functional form chosen by the (person who works to find information), 
 farmers may be classified as risk disliking or risk preferring. In contrast to the 
 huge utility function which (forces (on people)/causes an inconvenient situation) risk disgust on all farmers, the 
 quadratic utility function classified 27 farmers as (not wanting to do anything dangerous) and three as 
 risk-preferring, while the cubic utility function classified half of the farmers 
 as (not wanting to do anything dangerous) and half as risk-preferring. 
 In addition to the risk attitudes classification issue, this study explored 
 the effects of utility functional form on the ranking of risky prospects. It 
 was found that there were many preference reversals when different 
 functional forms were used to test mature against/compared to/or (too) early or soon collecting 
 plans. This study examined the simple choice of either mature or 
 (too) early or soon collecting. The large number of preference reversals suggests 
 that if the analysis was extended to the more complicated case of (mix of stocks, bonds, etc./document collection) 
 selection, (mixes of stocks, bonds, etc./document collections) also would be sensitive to choice of functional form. 
 In this study, the EUF (did/done/completed) better than other functions in (describing the future) overall farmer behavior, but more research is needed to better (describe the future) 
 (too) early or soon collecting behavior. The results do not suggest that the EUF will 
 be the appropriate function in all cases. Rather, the results of this study 
 suggest that when employing a utility function, a few functions must be 
 guessed and tested in terms of their power to (describe the future) actual situations. Only then can the right/the proper function for further analysis be 
 selected. What's more, it should be noted that since an person's preferences and the utility function which will correctly reflect these preferences are (like nothing else) to each individual, it is not likely that one form of utility 
 function will correctly (describe the future) the behavior of all people. At best, a 
 utility function which (describes the future) behavior correctly for most people, such 
 as the EUF in this study, may be (able to be seen or picked out).
