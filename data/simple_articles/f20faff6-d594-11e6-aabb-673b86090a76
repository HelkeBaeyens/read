 Abstract 
 
 This study (asks lots of questions about/tries to find the truth about) the role of information in influencing the adoption of improved farm management 
 practices. A lack of producer information (related to/looking at/thinking about) both the money-making ability and (the health of the Earth/the surrounding conditions)al benefits of putting into use 
 improved practices may be a reason why (existing all over a large area) adoption of these practices has not happened. Compared to 
 direct regulation or (money-related) (rewards or reasons for doing something), raising producer information levels may be a more (producing a lot for a given amount of money) method of 
 increasing adoption. The United States Department of Farming has (not very long ago) established and begun putting into use 
 a program based on this idea. To test the truth/trueness of the program, a two-stage adoption model is specified and 
 guessed using data from a survey of producers in the program area. The results point to/show that producer perceptions 
 play an important role in the decision to adopt. Changing these perceptions by means of an educational program 
 may be a reasonable other choice to (money-related) (rewards or reasons for doing something) in encouraging BMP adoption. 
 
 1. Introduction 
 
 Best management practices (BMPs) are (related to scientific farming)ally sound practices that protect or improve 
 water quality and are at least as money-making as 
 existing practices. Producer knowing nothing about their 
 existence and mistakes in thinking of their effect on 
 farm a money-making state may result in reduced adoption

 rates of these practices. (money-related) (rewards or reasons for doing something) such 
 as cost sharing or (not having to pay taxes), where the 
 government 'shares' in the risk of adoption, are 
 common methods for overcoming bad perceptions. These types of (rewards or reasons for doing something) are expensive, especially if adoption depends mostly upon producer perceptions. An other choice is to put into use 
 programs that educate producers. These programs are mostly informational (rewards or reasons for doing something) because they encourage adoption by revising producer perceptions about the cost effectiveness of 
 new farming practices. Although fixed start-up 
 costs are got/caused, informational (rewards or reasons for doing something) may 
 be less expensive than (money-related) (rewards or reasons for doing something) in the long 
 run as information spreads throughout the farm 
 community.

 The United States Department of Farming 
 (USDA) has (not very long ago) put into use a program 
 based on this reason. The program depends on 
 a few (act of showing or proving) projects (DPs) located 
 across the country. Each DP is a area 
 containing farms practicing one or more BMPs. 
 The purpose of the program is to encourage 
 adoption through the (act of showing or proving) of BMPs to 
 local producers. The DP program can only be 
 successful if producers' perceptions are affected 
 by the presence of DPs, and if these perception 
 changes lead to increased adoption. 
 This paper (asks lots of questions about/tries to find the truth about) the scientific importance of informational (rewards or reasons for doing something) in BMP adoption. The scientific model uses data from a 
 recent adoption survey used/paid by the 
 USDA to test the DP approach. The first 
 phase of the survey was done in 1991, one 
 year after the program was started (see Nowak 
 and O'Keefe, 1992). The scientific model allows 
 for an test of how producer perceptions of 
 risk, a money-making state, and improvements in (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) quality influence adoption. Also, 
 the sampling design of the survey allows for a 
 direct comparison of producers under different 
 levels of influence from the DP, yet sharing almost the same  cropping and animals (features/ qualities/ traits). Differences in behavior across states and (land-area-based/location) 
 areas are also examined. 
 In the next section, a model of BMP adoption 
 is discussed. Instead of labeling the adoption 
 process as a single (divided into two) choice, the model 
 treats the decisions of adopting and then employing BMPs as a two-stage process. This allows 
 BMPs to be used in different strength levels 
 once the first decision to adopt has been made. 
 Examination of the strength decision allows for a 
 more realistic and interesting test of the 
 adoption process. Feder et al. (1985, p. 286) point 
 out that such a two-stage approach is especially 
 desirable when dealing with problems such as 
 (material that makes plants grow better) applications where strength may change/differ 
 widely over people who adopt. The following 
 sections contain a description of the survey data 
 and scientific model, the guess results, and 
 the ends/end results of the study. 
 
 2. A model of BMP adoption 
 BMPs are at least as money-making as existing 
 practices and improve water quality. Given this, 
 their adoption should depend mostly upon the 
 producer's perceptions of the BMP's benefits. 
 Better informed producers are assumed to adopt 
 BMPs because they are more aware of the benefits. The adoption model can be (agreed-upon) with 
 the producer's problem. Think about/believe a firm that 
 must decide which farming practice to employ. 
 For simpleness, assume each farming practice is 
 connected an input, Xi. Let the producer's strictly 
 curved utility function be given by 1 : 
 
 U[1Ti(Xi; y), Qi(Xi; 8); 
 =aj 
 
 U[1Ti(Xi; y); 
 
 D] 
 
 D] 
 
 +(1-aJ V[QJXi; 8); !1] 
 
 ( 1) 
 
 where y and 8 are independent random limits/guidelines with distributions fY and f 8, so that '7Ti( Â·) is 
 uncertain farm (money made/good thing received) and Qi( Â·) is uncertain onfarm (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) quality from adopting the ith 
 BMP; D represents the producer's (how money affects people's lives) 
 (features/ qualities/ traits) that can affect adoption, and aj E 
 [0, 1] is a producer-clearly stated/particular weight attached to 
 (money made/good things received) and (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) quality. Using the 
 ith practice involves giving-out Xi, the input connected with the practice. Because BMPs thought about/believed in the scientific part of/amount of the paper use 
 different inputs (e.g. labor, (material that makes plants grow better), or consultant fees), Xi is not specifically defined. The 
 strength of input usage represents the extent that 
 the practice is used on the farm. xi is a joint 
 input in both production and (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) quality 2 . Separability of the utility function changes something (to helps someone)/takes care of someone the fact that, for improved farming practices, stopping and crop production are often

 1t is assumed aU_pair(Â·)ja1Ti&amp;gt; 0, aU_pair 2 (-)ja1Tp &amp;lt;0, W(-)jaQi 
 
 &amp;gt; 0, and W 2 (. )jaQf &amp;lt; 0. 
 2 For example, think about/believe a BMP which involves giving-out 
 fertilization labor in stages as corn comes out. Here, the single 
 labor input both/together produces both water quality benefits and 
 (makes money/gets something good), because nitrate invasion is reduced and working well 
 is increased through more good (material that makes plants grow better) applications. 
 
 P.M Feather, G.S. Amacher/ Farming-based Money flow 11 (1994) 159-170 
 
 separate events, yet are the result of employing 
 the same input (see Malik and Shoemaker, 1993) 3 
 Given the benefits connected with the BMPs, 
 the most important way to encourage adoption is 
 to reduce the doubt surrounding use of the 
 practice. In the same way/in that way, the purpose of the DPs is 
 to use information to reduce uncertainties producers have about BMPs. The effect of improved 
 information is reflected in (1). The random limits/guidelines in the utility function represent the producer's doubt about the adoption of 
 the ith practice. It is assumed that better (based on knowledge and learning) producers are more confident of a practice's effects on (money made/good things received) and (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) quality, this way reducing their perceived variance of y 
 and 8. The effect of better information raises 
 confidence in the benefits of the BMPs and increases adoption. 
 The profit function in (1) for the ith practice 
 can be defined further as: 
 
 (2) 
 where P is the output price, w is the input cost, 
 f/ Â·) and X; are the uncertain output and input 
 needed things resulting from adoption of the ith 
 practice, C; is a known initial investment cost, 
 and at(Â· );ax; &#126; o and a2f( Â· )/ ax?&#126; 0. Fixed 
 costs appear in (2) to reflect the possibility that 
 some practices require initial money-giving 
 costs that are (like nothing else) to the adoption decision. 
 If the expected utility of using the ith practice 
 goes beyond that of the now used practice (U0 ), 
 then it is adopted: 
 aiEY U[ '1T;(X;; y); OJ 
 +(l-ai)E8 V[Q;(X;; o); OJ&#126; U0 
 
 (3) 
 
 where EY (E 8 ) is the expectations operator taken 
 over y (o). From (3), adoption of a BMP is more 
 
 likely whenever initial investment costs are low, 
 expected increases in (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) quality are 
 high, or costs and production are such that expected (money made/good things received) increase. If condition (3) holds, 
 then the producer (makes as big as possible) (1) subject to (2) to 
 decide/figure out at what strength the practice is used: 
 PEY U'(") 
 
 [af(X;; y);ax;-w] 
 
 +[(1-aJ/(ai)]E8 V'(") [aQ(X;; o);ax;] 
 = 
 
 0 
 
 These ideas (you think are true) are not (serving to severely limit or control). Although the same 
 input affects both stopping and production, its final/best 
 effect is different through the random limits/guidelines, because an 
 input such as labor can cause different expost effects on 
 (money made/good things received) and (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) quality. While the case y = 13 can 
 exist, the effects of two types of doubt will not in general 
 be equal. To illustrate a case where y = 13, think about/believe some 
 practice that gets/causes far greater labor needed things than the 
 producer was expecting. Here, use of the practice decreases 
 both (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) quality and (money made/good things received). 
 
 (4) 
 
 If the ith practice is adopted, then the producer decides/figures out best input use from (4). It is 
 serious and stubborn so that the expectation of the product 
 of not important utility and not important (money made/good thing received) from using 
 the practice are equal to the expectation of the 
 product of not important utility and not important benefits 
 in water quality. As X; increases, input strength 
 (either per area of land  or per farm) increases because 
 the producer uses the practice more a lot. 
 Strength depends positively on price, expected 
 not important input working well, and expected improvement of (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) quality, but negatively on input cost and the variance of y. The 
 effects of cost and price (numbers that change/things that change) on the adoption 
 and strength decisions appear in the Add on. 
 
 3. Guess and data 
 
 To specify the adoption decision, (3) is (said again) in a random utility (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) (agreed-upon) 
 by Manski (1973). People are assumed to 
 always select the other choice with greatest utility, 
 but since the true function is unknown, it must be 
 treated as random by the analyst 4 - (saying again) the 
 decision to adopt the ith practice given by (3) 
 under the random utility (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) results in: 
 a 1EY U['lT;(X;; y);

 4 Manski (1973) discusses four sources of randomness: unseen attributes, unseen taste differences/different versions, measurement 
 errors, and instrumental (numbers that change/things that change). These ideas are also 
 discussed in Ben-Akiva and Lerman (1985, pp. 55-57).

 term (taking by force)/(taking control of) the investigator's doubt (related to/looking at/thinking about) the producer's expectations of 'Y and 8. 
 The correction for censoring consists of calculating a correction term from the probit model and 
 including it as an (thing that you control (like study time), that causes something else to change (like a test score)) in the 
 strength model (see Maddala, 1983). 
 Data used to guess the model are taken 
 from a survey of producer BMP adoption behavior managed and did/done by Nowak and O'Keefe (1992) under partial money from a USDA cooperative 
 agreement; 957 completed lists of questions were 
 received/got from farming-based producers in eight 
 states (Nebraska, Minnesota, Wisconsin, North 
 Carolina, Maryland, Texas, California and 
 Florida). Enough survey information exists to 
 form testable guesses for the adoption patterns of five practices: 
 
 where si and s 0 are independently and identically distributed random (numbers that change/things that change) with mean zero 
 and variance one for all producers. This distributional idea (you think is true) allows (7) to be guessed using 
 a bivariate probit model (see Ben-Akiva and Lerman, 1985): 
 
 (6) 
 where P; is the chance that the ith BMP is 
 adopted, &amp;lt;I&amp;gt;(Â·) represents the total amount of (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) distribution function, Y; is a vector of (numbers that change/things that change) that 
 are arguments of (5), and 3{ is a vector of limits/guidelines to be guessed. 
 The strength decision is guessed as a linear 
 function to (pretty close) condition (3) while accounting for censoring of the data set to include 
 only producers who have adopted the practice: 
 
 (7) 
 
 Poop/fertilizer crediting. The producer guesses the 
 amount of (vitamins, minerals, protein, etc.) available for crops from applying animals or (related to chickens, hens, turkeys, etc.) poop/fertilizer. The amount 
 of commercial (material that makes plants grow better) applied is then (changed to make better/changed to fit new conditions) 
 by the amount given by the poop/fertilizer. 
 
 where I; is the strength of adoption for the ith 
 practice, Z is a vector of (numbers that change/things that change) that are arguments in the utility function, @ is a vector of 
 limits/guidelines to be guessed and 1J; is an error

 the first is the DP area itself, while the other 
 ('comparison' area) lies outside the DP and is 
 mostly a control. Differences in adoption rates 
 between DP areas and comparison areas, or between states, can be decided/figured out using chance 
 ratio (LR) tests (see Judge et al., 1985). Using the 
 former as an example, define: 
 
 expected cost, (money made/good thing received), risk and (effects on the surrounding conditions or on the health of the Earth) connected with each BMP on an ordered 
 scale was available. These were converted to 
 dummy (numbers that change/things that change) in order to divide the responses 
 into high or low expectations for each (number or thing that changes). 
 Since (3) and (4) depend on the importance of producer expectations, these questions serve as good proxies for the elements in the possible 
 model. 
 Table 1 contains a description of the (numbers that change/things that change) 
 used to guess the adoption models. Knowledge 
 of the BMP and the DP measures the producer's 
 information (related to/looking at/thinking about) the practice. Perceptions 
 of risk measure the producer's confidence in the 
 benefits of adopting the BMP. Opinions (related to/looking at/thinking about) the money-making ability and labor needed things of 
 each BMP (pretty close) (numbers that change/things that change) appearing in 
 (2); expected quality changes serve as an indicator of Q; in (1). The importance of these (numbers that change/things that change) in the adoption decision can be decided/figured out 
 using simple t-tests of the limit/guideline guesses. 
 The corn land (number or thing that changes) (Corn) describes the 
 size of the operation. This (number or thing that changes) was selected 
 because a majority of the people who responded grow corn, 
 and most of the BMPs involve row cropping practices. Finally, the presence of animals 
 is assumed to influence poop/fertilizer crediting. 
 In each state, two types of areas were sampled:

 4. Guess results and discussion 
 The first stage of the two-stage model is only 
 used to test the adoption of each BMP, with 
 the exception of split application of nitrogen 
 which is the only BMP that differs/changes significantly in 
 strength 5 . Probit guesses of the first stage of 
 the adoption models appear in Tables 2-6. Two 
 'unrestricted' probit models are included for each 
 practice. The first ('state' model) is used to test 
 for differences in adoption between states; the 
 second ('DemojComp' model) is used to test for 
 differences in adoption between the DP areas 
 and the comparison areas. The Demo1 Camp 
 models contain dummy (numbers that change/things that change) for (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) 
 in comparison areas or DP areas; the state models contain dummy (numbers that change/things that change) for each state. These 
 models will be compared to a model containing a 
 constant term ('Constant' model) to test for differences in adoption rates. Each Table also contains a column showing the watched/followed adoption 
 rate in each state and in the DP and comparison 
 areas. 
 
 5 All other practices are usually used at full strength once 
 adopted. 
 
 Two (numbers that change/things that change) are used to measure producer 
 informational states: knowledge of the practice 
 (Prac Aware) and of the demonstration project 
 (Demo Aware). Both limits/guidelines usually have an 
 expected positive sign and are often significant. 
 This result was expected because information is 
 assumed to produce the mean and variance of y 
 and o. By definition, BMPs are at least as money-making as existing practices and improve water 
 quality. As the producer becomes more informed, 
 the doubt (related to/looking at/thinking about) the use of the BMP 
 decreases and the expectations of y and o may 
 increase, since the better (based on knowledge and learning) producer views 
 the practice as more money-making and less (making dirty). 
 In contrast, the dummy (number or thing that changes) connected with 
 the tested riskiness of each practice (Risk) (did/done/completed) poorly in the adoption models. This limit/guideline was expected to be negative because 
 producers who perceive a practice to be risky 
 have a higher variance connected with y and will 
 tend not to adopt. 
 The expected change in (money made/good things received) ((money made/good things received)) (number or thing that changes) is regularly significant and positive in all 
 of the adoption models. This result reflects condition (3) where adoption happens if (money made/good things received) are expected to increase. Another part in (3), 
 (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) quality, is positive in four of the 
 
 P.M. Feather, G.S. Amacher/ Farming-based Money flow 11 (1994) 159-170 
 
 five adoption models, but significant in only two 
 of the models. Comparing the two limits/guidelines 
 across all models shows/tells about that the Profits limit/guideline is larger than (the health of the Earth/the surrounding conditions)al quality (Quality) limit/guideline in most of the adoption 
 models. This may point to/show that the adoption decision is driven more by expected increases in 
 (money made/good things received) than by (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) quality. In the possible model, expectations (related to/looking at/thinking about) the input 
 needed things of a BMP directly effect strength at 
 which it is practiced, but only indirectly effect the 
 adoption decision via the profit function. Adoption decisions are influenced by perceived (money made/good things received) 
 and (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) quality. Strength decisions are 
 influenced by the portion of an input according 
 to (4). The survey contains information about 
 changes in a single input, labor, connected with 
 the adoption of each BMP. Although the labor 
 (number or thing that changes) is more appropriate in the strength model 
 than the adoption model, it appears in the adoption models mainly because most of the BMPs 
 are practiced at full strength once adopted. The 
 limit/guideline connected with this (number or thing that changes) is negative, as expected, in four of the five models. 
 However, the limit/guideline is never very different from zero. This hints that expected 
 labor needed things are less important in the 
 adoption decision than (money made/good things received) and (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) 
 quality. 
 The number of areas of land used in corn production 
 is positive and significant in all of the adoption 
 models. The poop/fertilizer crediting adoption model 
 contains two added/more (numbers that change/things that change) to account for 
 the presence of beef (cows, bulls, etc.) (Beef) and dairy (cows, bulls, etc.) 
 (Dairy). Both positively effect adoption rates of 
 this practice, but only Dairy is very different from zero. 
 Guess results for the split application of 
 nitrogen strength model appear in Table 7. The 
 (thing that changes (like a test score) because of something else that you control (like study time)) is the percentage of total corn 
 areas of land receiving split applications of nitrogen. To 
 test for differences in strength, this model is also 
 guessed in the 'State' and 'DemojComp' versions. The input (number or thing that changes) (Labor) is negative and 
 significant pointing to/showing that producers who find the 
 practice more labor intensive tend to practice it 
 at lower strength. The possible model also 
 (describes the future) that increases in output price (reflected

 in the Profits (number or thing that changes)) should increase strength 
 while increases in the variance of y (reflected in 
 the Risk (number or thing that changes)) should decrease strength. Although both of these (numbers that change/things that change) were unimportant 
 in the guessed model, the limit/guideline signs agree with the possible model. Finally, the number of areas of land of corn produced on the farm (Corn) 
 is highly significant in explaining strength. As 
 corn land increases, strength reduces. 
 Chance ratio statistics for tests of importance between DP and comparison areas appear 
 in Table 8. The results point to/show that significant 
 differences exist for the adoption and strength of 
 split application of nitrogen and the adoption of 
 (pea, bean, lentil, etc.) crediting across DP and comparison areas. No differences are found for the remaining 
 three BMPs 6 . (careful examination of something) of Tables 2-7 shows/tells about 
 that adoption levels are almost equal across DP 
 areas and comparison areas for all but these two 
 BMPs (where adoption levels are higher in the 
 DP areas). 
 Test statistics for differences in adoption levels 
 across states also appear in Table 8. Adoption

 adoption rates between Demonstration Areas and Comparison Areas would be rejected at about the 13.5% error 
 level for poop/fertilizer crediting.

 rates were found to significantly differ across 
 states for every practice. The test results, importance of differences in state dummy (number or thing that changes) limits/guidelines, and adoption percentages shown in Tables 2-6 point to/show that adoption rates change/differ  much 
 more across states than across DP and comparison areas. Factors such as the quality of extension 
 services, output price differences/different versions and soil life-creating ability 
 that change/differ  from state to state, but are not included 
 in the model, are likely to account for this result. 
 Differences in the models then arise because 
 these factors are (taken by force/controlled) in the state dummy 
 (numbers that change/things that change). In order to control for difference/different version between states when testing DP areas against/compared to/or comparison areas, two models were guessed for 
 each practice in each state. The first contains a 
 constant term; the second contains dummy (numbers that change/things that change) for DP areas and comparison areas. Chance ratio tests, appearing in Table 9, were then 
 carried out to decide/figure out if the two models differ 
 (individual models are not reported). The results 
 show that few a big differences in adoption 
 rates exist between DP and comparison areas 
 across states and practices. A negative-minded explanation for the lack of difference in adoption levels 
 between the DP and comparison areas would be 
 that the DP program is not working. However, 
 given the (very big/very strong) importance of the 'Demo 
 Aware' (number or thing that changes) in the adoption models, a more 
 
 reasonable explanation is that the comparison area 
 is not completely separated from the DP area. This 
 seems more likely given that some producers in 
 the comparison area have knowledge of the DP 
 program. 
 
 5. Ending/deciding statements 
 
 This paper has examined the adoption of management practices which improve water quality 
 and maintain or improve farm a money-making state. The 
 USDA Demonstration Project program is based 
 on the reason that information (related to/looking at/thinking about) the 
 benefits of the practices will provide (good) enough 
 adoption (rewards or reasons for doing something). Helping adoption through 
 education is a reasonable, and possibly more 
 (producing a lot for a given amount of money), other choice to direct regulation or 
 (money-related) (rewards or reasons for doing something). To test the DP program, a 
 possible adoption model which allows information to influence the adoption decision by decreasing uncertainties connected with each practice was specified. This model was guessed using the results of a producer survey containing 
 information about the adoption patterns for five 
 BMPs across different states, and across DP and 
 comparison areas. 
 The guess results are carefully in favor 
 of the DP program. Formal tests of the models

 showed/told about that adoption patterns are significantly 
 different for two of the five practices, and 
 (only a little bit) different for a third. More importantly, the models (showed/shown or proved) that knowledge 
 of the DP program has a significantly positive 
 influence on adoption rates. Because producer 
 tests of each BMPs hit/effect on farm a money-making state was important, this hints that the success of information programs depends on improved practices being (money-based)/cheaply appealing as 
 well as smart. Only then will 
 (without being forced) adoption happen. 
 Given the goals of an informational (reward or reason for doing something) program, the results also suggest that producers in different areas respond differently to 
 information about the benefits of BMPs. Care 
 must be taken in designing an (producing a lot with very little waste) (reward or reason for doing something) 
 program that accounts for these (related to a large area) differences in water quality problems and crop production details. In putting into use such a program, 
 the results in this paper show that the effect of a 
 DP site is not kept to/restricted to  small, (only happening or existing in one small place) areas 
 near the DP. If BMPs are (money-based)/cheaply attractive this information should spread through the 
 fa&#126;ing community and increase adoption. 
 6. Add on of (not numbers-based) results 
 If a BMP is adopted, its level of use is defined 
 
 from condition (4) in the text. The endogenous 
 limit/guideline is X; the (coming from the outside of something) limits/guidelines are p, 
 a C. and w. The change in the endogenous 
 ' " 
 limits/guidelines 
 with respect to the (coming from the outside of something) limits/guidelines is found through application of the understood 
 function true idea to condition (4) (Silberberg, 
 1989). If g is any (coming from the outside of something) limit/guideline, the form 
 of this expression is - Vx8 /Vxx' where the denominator (i.e., the second-order condition for 
 (4)) is negative and the numerator is defined for 
 each limit/guideline as follows: 
 
 VLp=EU'(Â·) [_( 
 
 af(X;y)]_) 
 ax 
 
 +E U"(") f(X; y) [_( P

 VXaj =

 For (Al), the first term is positive given the utility 
 function (see note 1); the second term is 
 positive because U" &amp;lt; 0, and the term in brackets 
 is negative from (4): V' &amp;gt; 0, U' &amp;gt; 0, so p af( Â·);ax 
 -w &amp;lt; 0 to make happy (4). Identical thinking applies 
 in deciding/figuring out the sign of (A2). 
 In the text, we explained the association between increases in the variance of 'Y; with increases in doubt surrounding adoption of 
 practice i. For simpleness we can limit/guidelineize an 
 increase in the variance of 'Y; as a mean-preserving spread: 
 
 Y; = 
 
 Y; 
 
 + ( Y;- Y;)'TI 
 
 where y is the mean of 'Y; in (1). Note that 
 E[y;] = )i;, and var(f) = (y;- :YY77 2 - Inserting Y; 
 for 'Y; in condition (4) and dropping the i subscript for noteal simpleness, it can be shown:

 The first term is positive if y &amp;gt; y (see discussion of (Al)). If the cross partial, a2f(X; y)jaX 
 yes, is large and negative, the expression above is 
 therefore nonpositive; the producer practices the 
 BMP less intensively as the variance of y increases. 
 To (ask lots of questions about/try to find the truth about) how decreasing total risk 
 disgust (DARA) affects the results of the (serving to compare two or more things) statics, think about/believe the expressions for 
 ax;a'lT and ax;a77. As the producer's income 
 increases, his attitudes toward risk will decide/figure out 
 whether ax;a'lT and ax;a77 become more positive or negative. Because P is a part of 'IT, 
 we can further expect that any limit/guideline change 
 
 P.M. Feather, G.S. Amacher/Agricultural Money flow 11 (1994) 159-170 
 
 170 
 
 that makes 7T increase will have the same effect 
 as the price. We (ask lots of questions about/try to find the truth about) these suggestions (or plans) 
 here. 
 The importance of risk hatred of the input 
 use 1 strength decision is serious and stubborn from the 
 expression - Vx7T!Vxx' where: 
 Vx7T=E'YU"(Â·) [Paf(X;y)jaX-w] &#126;0 
 
 Dividing the numerator and the denominator of 
 this expression by U'( Â·) =fo 0, and using the Arrow-Pratt measure of risk disgust (Varian, 1984) 
 gives the following result: 
 
 ax 
 a1r

 where p(7T)= -U"(Â·)/U'(Â·) is the Arrow-Pratt 
 measure of total risk disgust, D = 
 [V'( Â· )/U'( Â· )]_), D' = V"(- )jU'( Â· ), and B = 
 P af(X; "y)jaX- w =::;;; 0 from condition (4) (see 
 discussion of (Al) and A2)) and strict curviness of 
 U( Â· ). For increases in (money made/good things received), both D and D' 
 decrease in (value of a number, ignoring its sign) (assuming separatable 
 utility). Therefore, under DARA, p'(7T) ::;;; 0, so 
 that aL ;a1r becomes more positive as (money made/good things received) 
 increase if the producer becomes less (not wanting to do anything dangerous) 
 with increasing income. 
 (in almost the same way), we can (ask lots of questions about/try to find the truth about) how changes in 
 risk disgust effects the decision to accept practices with greater doubt (i.e., greater variances). Going ahead as above, but this time dividing ax;a71 through by U'( Â·) =1= 0:

 where the denominator N is equal to that of 
 ax;a1r. The condition above generally has an 
 indeterminant sign. Under DARA and for (compared to other things) small changes in 7], ax;a71 becomes more 
 positive (strength of use increases) as farm income increases. For a practice that has a very 
 large variance in its effect on (money made/good things received), the effect of 
 risk disgust on strength is unclear.
