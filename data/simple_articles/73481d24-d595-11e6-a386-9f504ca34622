 Abstract 
 Many mechanized crop producers and farms are fascinated with quality farm-related technology, but adoption 
 has fell behind the expectations. Among the reasons for slow adoption of quality farm-related technology is that initial 
 users focused very on in-field benefits from variable-rate (material that makes plants grow better) application using (related to a large area) average (material that makes plants grow better) recommendations. This article illustrates how greater use of site-specific crop response information can improve changeable rate input 
 application recommendations. 
 Quality farming is (related to space or existing in space) information technology applied to agriculture. The technologies include worldwide  position 
 systems (GPS), (land-area-based/location) information systems (GIS), produce watching sensors, and computer controlled within-field changeable 
 rate computer program (VRA) equipment. (trying new things out/testing ideas scientifically) with these technologies is happening everywhere there is large scale 
 mechanized farming. Commercial use has been greatest in the US, where 43% of farm stores offered VRA services in 
 2001. Except for certain high-value crops like sugar red vegetable, farmer adoption ofVRA has been modest. The farm level a money-making state 
 of VRA continues to be (possibly not true, good, or honest) for bulk valuable thing crops. 
 The possible model and illustration presented here suggest that VRA (the adding of things to soil to make plants grow better) has not yet reached its a money-making state 
 (possible greatness or power). Most VRA field trials to date have relied upon existing state-wide or (related to a large area) input rate recommendations. Unseen soil (features/ qualities/ traits) can possibly interact with an input to make its effect on yield change/differ  site-specifically within fields. 
 Failure to use site-clearly stated/particular response functions for VRA applications may lead to a misallocation of inputs just as great as that 
 which results from using uniform applications instead of VRA. 
 Farming-based money-flow experts have a long history of guessing output response to input uses. A few have started to 
 develop tools to guess site-clearly stated/particular responses from yield monitor and other quality farming data. Also, farming-based 
 money-flow experts have developed an important body of research results on information value based on managing (quality of changing over time or at different places)typically in time-related settings. With these tools, a major potential exists to develop further benefits from quality farming 
 technologies that allow truly (related to space or existing in space)ly custom-designed input uses.

 1. Introduction 
 
 2. Background and guess 
 
 Worldwide  positioning systems (GPS) and sensors are 
 turning the data-poor farming-based production part/area 
 into a data-rich (surrounding conditions). Farmers have always 
 known that crop yields change/differ  (related to space or existing in space)ly. But until the 
 early 1990s the technology of commercial farm 
 equipment did not permit much in the way of (related to space or existing in space) management, and gathering data on (related to space or existing in space) (quality of changing over time or at different places) of yields or farm land (features/ qualities/ traits) for the 
 purpose of fine-tuning management was too expensive. Because of this expense, generation of described/explained 
 crop production data was limited to small plot trials, mainly on experiment stations. One-size-fits-all 
 extension recommendations based on these small 
 plots were predicted over large areas. But in the 
 1990s, the (non-military related) use of GPS and availability of low 
 cost computers made (related to space or existing in space)ly-related management 
 (related to computers and science) (able to be done), and created an explosion of 
 farming-based data with locational attributes. 
 It will be argued in this paper that the way in which 
 crop input use recommendations are developed has not caught up with the (related to computers and science) progress 
 that has made (related to space or existing in space) management (related to computers and science) 
 (able to be done). So, now there is still a 
 disconnection between the (related to a large area)-scale recommendations for input management put out by extension 
 services, and the described/explained (related to space or existing in space) data that are now inexpensively recoverable with the newest technologies. 
 This disconnection raises important questions about 
 whether more (related to space or existing in space)ly custom-designed input recommendations could add value for crop producers. The purpose 
 of this article is to raise these questions clearly, 
 and to begin to address them. Especially, this paper 
 aims: (1) to summarize money-based research on changeable rate input use, including (identification of a disease or problem, or its cause) of adoption 
 restrictions; (2) to (say again) the crop production money flow/money-based studies problem in (related to space or existing in space) terms; and (3) to illustrate 
 how including site (features/ qualities/ traits) into changeable 
 rate application (VRA) fertilization recommendations 
 can make changeable rate farming more' money-making and 
 (related to space or existing in space) field data more valuable. Completing these 
 goals leads to the end/end result that the way in 
 which farm experts and farming-based money-flow experts recommend input application rates to farmers should 
 change totally to make better use of (related to space or existing in space) input 
 management technology in both production and data 
 collection. 
 
 Use of GPS, (related to where mountains, rivers, cities, etc., are located) information systems 
 (GIS), electronic sensors and other (related to space or existing in space) information technology in farming is often labeled "quality 
 farming." Though the technology has wide effects/results/suggestions for marketing, risk management, planning and 
 other whole farm information system issues (Swinton 
 and Lowenberg-DeBoer, 1998), its initial use has been 
 on intrafield management of crop inputs by different 
 application rates within fields. (trying new things out/testing ideas scientifically) with 
 quality farm-related technology is happening throughout the world wherever farming is mechanized. The 
 technology is being used commercially in the US, 
 Canada, Argentina, Brazil, South Africa and in most 
 western (related to Europe) countries (Norton and Swinton, 
 2002; Swinton and Lowenberg-DeBoer, 2001). (A 
 fuller description of quality farm-related technology 
 and potential uses can be found in Lowenberg-DeBoer 
 and Erickson (2000) and Morgan and Ess (1997).) 
 The crop GIS has many layers. From an money-based 
 (way of seeing things / sensible view of what is and is not important), the yield layer is the integrator of all the 
 factors that influence crop growth, but many factors 
 and their interactions influence that yield. Much of the 
 early interest in (related to space or existing in space) crop growth (quality of changing over time or at different places) came 
 from soil scientists. The soils layers include soil test 
 results on macro- and micronutrients, organic matter level and soil physical (features/ qualities/ traits). One of the 
 first (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) from yield maps was that production seemed closely linked to water availability and 
 movement. This triggered an interest in mountains, land, rivers, etc., 
 micro-weather and drainage layers. Since the 1970s, 
 there have been tries to use remote sensing images in crop production. Including (from high in the air) and satellite 
 images in a crop GIS possibly provides low cost 
 information on crop growth and plant population. 
 (related to space or existing in space) management of seasonal inputs is made 
 possible by VRA controllers. These controllers can 
 change rate of input flow or switch input source (e.g. 
 between seed or (material that makes plants grow better) types) in response to computer signals as farm equipment moves through a 
 field. VRA equipment makes it possible to put into use site-specific input control in response to GIS 
 records of input needs and GPS location data. This 
 site-clearly stated/particular control of inputs has two possible benefits. First, it allows farmers to custom-design their input 
 application rates to the changing/different yield response (features/ qualities/ traits) in different parts of a field. Second, it allows 
 
 D.S. Little bull et al.! Farming-based Money flow 27 (2002) 233-245 
 
 for inexpensive gathering of site-clearly stated/particular data, which 
 can provide the farmer wanting to farm using VRA 
 with valuable information. 
 In Section 3, a book-related review is presented to argue that money-based performance of VRA in general has 
 been poor. A variety of money-based and technical reasons are presented to explain why most VRA has been 
 put into use with an guess of input needs based on 
 whole field information. This (instance of watching, noticing, or making a statement) leads to the 
 key guess, illustrated in Section 5 using the possible (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) developed in Section 4, which is 
 that the poor money-based performance of VRA has come 
 about mostly because information on the (related to space or existing in space) (quality of changing over time or at different places) of crop response has not been used (good or well enough) 
 in developing input recommendations (Swinton and 
 Lowenberg-DeBoer, 1998). 
 
 3. Money-based research on adoption of VRA 
 In 2001, about 46% of all farm stores m the 
 US offered some type of intensive soil sampling services, most commonly on a 1 ha (2.5 acre) grid basis (Whipker and Akridge, 2001). About one-third of 
 US stores offered some type of computer-controlled 
 (material that makes plants grow better) VRA in the 2001 crop season. In the Midwest, almost 43% of stores offered VRA in 2001. 
 Computer-controlled VRA services in the US were 
 introduced in the late 1980s, and grew quickly in the 
 1990s, but sales have been flat since 1999. 
 For some higher value specialty crops, like sugar 
 red vegetables, usage of changeable rate nutrient spreading is quite 
 high. Grower surveys point to/show that in 1996 about 25% 
 of the red vegetable  areas of land in the Red River Valley of North 
 Dakota and Minnesota were grid soil sampled and had 
 nitrogen applied at a changeable rate. In 1999, changeable 
 rate nitrogen was used on about 40% of the sugar red vegetable 
 land in the two states (Franzen, 2000). 
 For bulk valuable things (e.g. corn, soybeans and 
 wheat), the rate of intensive soil sampling and changeable rate application has been (in a big way) lower than 
 dealer service offerings would point to/show. Khanna et al. 
 (1999) showed that about 14% of farmers in Illinois, 
 Iowa, Indiana and Wisconsin used some GPS soil 
 sampling in 1997 and about 12% some changeable rate 
 (material that makes plants grow better) in 1997. USDA data from 1998 show that 
 nation-wide in the US, about 2% of all farms were 
 using grid soil sampling or VRA (Daberkow and 
 
 235 
 
 McBride, 2000), but adoption was higher for grain 
 and oilseed producers. The 1998 USDA data shows 
 that 7% of grain and oilseed producers used grid soil 
 sampling and 6% used VRA. A 1999 Ohio survey 
 showed that about 8% of farmers had done some GPS 
 soil sampling and about 7% some VRA of (material that makes plants grow better) 
 or lime (Batte, 2001). 
 Many US producers of bulk valuable things (corn, 
 soybeans and wheat) are fascinated by the idea of 
 site-clearly stated/particular management of soil life-creating ability. It is an obviously appealing idea, but has been harmed by 
 continued questions about the money-making ability of the practice. The response of many growers has been to enroll part of their land in one of the site-specific 
 soil management programs offered by (material that makes plants grow better) stores. For many farmers this is a low cost way to learn 
 about quality farming without long-term investment 
 in equipment. 
 In western Europe, Latin America and Australia 
 there is (trying new things out/testing ideas scientifically) with VRA, but (compared to other things) little commercial use (Norton and Swinton, 2002). In 
 Latin America and Australia the high cost of soil sampling limits the intensive soil sampling that is now the basis of VRA decisions. In western Europe 
 VRA seems to be driven mainly by (concern about the health of the Earth) and regulation. In a 1997 mail survey of 90 crop 
 farmers in Great Britain, Fountas (1998) found that 
 7% used VRA and 12% used (related to space or existing in space)ly referenced soil 
 sampling and mapping. 
 Use of changeable rate planting and changeable rate bug-killer use is more scattered than is use of changeable rate (material that makes plants grow better) use. Khanna et al. (1999) 
 found that in 1997 about 2.1% of farmers in Illinois, 
 Iowa, Wisconsin and Indiana practiced changeable rate 
 bug-killer use, and about 1% did changeable rate 
 seeding. Daberkow and McBride (2000) show that 
 about 1.7% of US producers used changeable rate bug-killer use in 1998, and the use of changeable rate 
 seeding was less than 1% of farmers. 
 3.1. VRA a money-making state in field trials 
 The data referred to above point to/show that while for some 
 higher value crops, VRA seems to have been adopted 
 on a planned and wide scale, for the great majority 
 of crops, VRA adoption rates remain quite low. An 
 obvious candidate to explain low adoption rates is the 
 possibility that (money made/good thing received) rates from VRA are low. Most 
 
 236 
 
 D.S. Little bull et al./ Farming-based Money flow 27 (2002) 233-245 
 
 money-based studies of quality farm-related technology 
 have focused on VRA of (material that makes plants grow better) because that was 
 the first technology to be made money from and it was 
 also the one on which the most data was available 
 for money-based analysis. The published results on a money-making state of VR nutrient computer programs can be hard 
 to understand/explain, due to differences in experimental design 
 and ideas (you think are true) about included costs. Lambert and 
 Lowenberg-DeBoer (2000) reviewed 108 studies of 
 quality farming-based a money-making state. Some 63% report 
 (money made/good things received), but many of those leave out important costs, make 
 silly produce advantage guesses, or use (testing out) methods that may underestimate non-treatment 
 effects. Partial budgets on VR (material that makes plants grow better) computer program are 
 driven by three elements: (1) increased cost of soil 
 sampling information and VRA; (2) change in cost of 
 (material that makes plants grow better) applied; and (3) change in money/money income due to 
 crop produce. The added information cost is central, yet 
 it is left-out from some studies. 
 Swinton and Lowenberg-DeBoer (1998) examined 
 a money-making state results from nine university field research 
 studies of VRA fertilization (Table 1). They applied 
 standard minimum cost ideas (you think are true) to all studies 
 where selected cost items had been left-out. They 
 found that the value of crop yield gains was especially important. High-value crops that responded to 
 VRA of (material that makes plants grow better) tended to do so more (in a money-making way) than 
 low-value crops, because the yield gains were worth 
 more. VRA of (material that makes plants grow better) on wheat and grain was 
 nowhere money-making, the results for corn were mixed, 
 and VRA (material that makes plants grow better) on sugar red vegetable  was money-making. By 
 contrast, cost savings from reduced (material that makes plants grow better) application were much less important. The (material that makes plants grow better) inputs 
 being managed are fairly low cost and only one study 
 managed more than two of them. Given that soil 
 testing is fairly expensive, most of the crops are of fairly 
 low value, and macronutrient (material that makes plants grow better)s are (compared to other things) 
 cheap, the cost of over-fertilizing is fairly low. 
 3.2. VRA a money-making state in (testing out) studies 
 There is a almost the same  group of studies using crop growth 
 (testing out) to test site-clearly stated/particular soil nutrient management. Lowenberg-DeBoer and Swinton (1997) 
 review the (testing out) studies through 1997. (testing out) studies that have appeared after 1997 include: 
 Thirkawala et al. (1999), Babcock and Pautsch 
 (1998) and English et al. (1999). Like field studies, 
 
 the (testing out) studies give mixed a money-making state results 
 for VRA fertilization, but they are more likely to show 
 VRA a money-making state because they do not always include 
 other yield limiting factors. For example, intensive soil 
 sampling may show areas of low phosphorus in a field. 
 (testing out) may suggest a yield increase with VRA of 
 phosphorus. The reality may be that these are areas in 
 which water holding ability (to hold or do something) is the most limiting factor and increasing phosphorous has little yield benefit. 
 3.3. Other VRA input technologies 
 Scattered studies have dealt with the money flow/money-based studies of 
 VRA of inputs other than (material that makes plants grow better). In on-farm experiments Barnhisel et al. (1996) showed that changeable 
 rate plant (groups of people/animals/things) can be money-making in the Kentucky karst (wide view of a nature scene/wide area of beautiful land), which are seen as wide 
 difference/different version in yield (possible greatness or power). Lowenberg-DeBoer (1998) 
 showed when management zones are figured out by/decided by 
 yield (possible greatness or power), changeable rate seeding for corn is money-making only when some parts of the field have potentials 
 below 6.3 Mg/ha. Little bull et al. (1998) carefully studied small 
 plot data from 1987 to 1996 and found that there may 
 be small yield gains when plant population is varied 
 by soil type, but the cost of deciding/figuring out best plant 
 population by soil type probably goes beyond the benefit 
 in most cases. Bongiovanni and Lowenberg-DeBoer 
 (2000a) used a (testing out) model to carefully study the profit 
 (possible power or ability within/possibility of)  VRA of lime in Indiana. They found that 
 VRA of lime was money-making under a wide range of 
 facts or conditions (that surround someone), mostly because the best 
 pH range is (compared to other things) narrow and there are negative 
 effects of over-liming (e.g. micronutrient tie up, increased damage from certain soil applied herbicides). 
 3.4. (Combined different things together so they worked as one unit) VRA systems 
 In way of thinking/basic truth/rule, quality management of many inputs can provide greater a money-making state than managing 
 each input separately for two reasons. First, interactions between inputs can be fine-tuned. Second, data 
 collection, analysis and putting into use steps can be 
 combined for some inputs. The interaction of the right 
 corn combination at the best population for that combination with 
 the (money made/good thing received) making the most of nitrogen rate for that combination 
 and population, can produce better and may be more 
 money-making than if each input were improved separately. One example of combining steps happens in soil

 sampling. The labor needed/demanded to do grid soil sampling 
 is the same whether that sample is tested for only 
 pH, or also tested for phosphorus, potassium, cation 
 exchange ability (to hold or do something) (CEC), and other (features/ qualities/ traits). 
 VRA costs will be lower if soil sampling costs can be 
 spread over many inputs. 
 There are no truly (having different things working together as one unit) quality farming systems, but (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) from the Sauder farm trials (Finck, 
 1998) supports the idea that systems that 
 manage many inputs are more money-making. These 
 trials (combined different things together so they worked as one unit) changeable rate management of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium with planting rate on 
 a 526 ha farm producing a balanced corn-soybean rotation in central Illinois. (The (trying new things out/testing ideas scientifically) "cost" 
 was treated as a sunk cost at the time when the Sauder 
 VRT trials where managed and did/done.) Over 3 years the average benefit from the GPS-based management for both 
 corn and soybeans was US$_$ 34.35/ha. The experimental design did not allow (people who work to find information) to identify 
 which parts of the system added/gave most to the 
 benefit, but it was clear that a 0.9 Mg/ha increase in 
 average corn yields played an important role. This is 
 one of the only studies that have shown a (related to numbers) 
 significant hit/effect of site-clearly stated/particular management on 
 yields. 
 In addition to being more (combined different things together so they worked as one unit), the Sauder 
 farm trials was different from almost all other quality 
 farming research in that the producer had conducted 
 on-farm research to decide/figure out best nitrogen rates 
 and corn plant (groups of people/animals/things) on his soils and his management before starting VRA. A key guess is 
 that the impressive (related to scientific farming) and money-based performance in the Sauder trials is linked in part to use of 
 site-specific response information, instead of relying 
 on (related to a large area) recommendations. 
 
 4. A model of (related to space or existing in space) profit optimization 
 Unlike the Sauder farm, modern VRA (the adding of things to soil to make plants grow better) in the US usually works from recommendations that are based on (related to a large area) average crop growth. 
 Given the ability to gather (related to space or existing in space) (related to scientific farming) data and 
 apply inputs (related to space or existing in space)ly with VRA, the challenge is to 
 decide how much of each input to apply in order to 
 meet the goal of making the most of the decision maker's 
 happiness, which we will proxy here with the profit 
 function n(Â· ). To make clear the (topics that are important now), 
 
 a possible model of (related to space or existing in space) profit optimization is 
 presented. 
 For a crop producer it is assumed that nO is increasing in crop produce and that crop yield./(-) can be 
 described as a function of managed (number or thing that changes) inputs (x ), 
 unable to control (random/including random data points) inputs (z-famously weather), 
 and unable to control but non-(random/including random data points) site (features/ qualities/ traits) (c). The site (features/ qualities/ traits) argument distinguishes 
 this (related to space or existing in space)ly small yield function (Little bull 
 et al., 1998; Little bull and Little bull, 2000) from those 
 (before that/before now) used to develop input recommendations 
 (Intelligent and Dillon, 1961; Dillon and Anderson, 1990). 
 (related to scientific farming) research has tended to find that plant 
 (vitamins, minerals, protein, etc.) increase crop yield up to some greatest 
 level beyond which they may (stop getting better or worse) or (lower in number/get worse). 
 Where pests are present, this pattern is also true of 
 damage-control inputs like bug-killers. So it is reasonable to expectj(x, z, c) to be locally curved at money-based levels of x, though it may have an increasing 
 not important product and be locally curving out at low levels of x. Second, the arguments of the yield function 
 usually interact (e.g. (material that makes plants grow better), soil (features/ qualities/ traits) 
 and rainfall), so the yield function is non-separatable in 
 these qualities, especially x and c. 
 Using a version of the classic profit (biggest increase/best possible extent) problem changed to fit (related to space or existing in space) management by 
 Lowenberg-DeBoer and Boehlje (1997) and Little bull 
 and Little bull (2000), the basic (related to space or existing in space) management 
 optimization problem can be written as:

 site (features/ qualities/ traits), and z is a vector of uncontrollable 
 factors that are changeable by site. The last three terms in 
 the unemotional function are costs: g are almost-fixed costs 
 for data collection and management, v are almost-fixed 
 costs for VRA technology, and F are other fixed costs. 
 Subscripts i and j index (numbers that change/things that change) to rectangular cells 
 in a Cartesian plane, where i is the (north-south position/freedom) of a cell's 
 center, and j is the position. Weather (numbers that change/things that change) z are 
 assumed not to change/differ  within the farmer's field, and 
 therefore do not carry the (related to space or existing in space) subscripts i, j. 
 Central to developing the decision tool is the scientific job  of finding limits/guidelines for small inputs 
 
 D.S. Little bull et at. I Farming-based Money flow 27 (2002) 233-245 
 
 in the yield function Yi, J = f( x; ,J. c;,J,Z). The most 
 common approach to limit/guidelineizing a yield function 
 is (related to studying numbers) guess. Field data are needed/demanded that 
 include (quality of changing over time or at different places) in all of the (numbers that change/things that change) serving as arguments in the yield function. Unfortunately, in many 
 cases the field (typical and expected) (numbers that change/things that change) c;,J may be 
 non-(capable of being seen and known). In this case it is not possible to guess the "meta" yield response function fx{, c, z). 
 However, it may still be possible, without watching/ noticing/ celebrating/ obeying 
 c;,J, to guess a "site-specific" yield response function J; ,J (x; ,J, z)= f (x; ,J , c; ,z, z) for a small piece of 
 land. This hints conducting on-farm experiments 
 to guess site-clearly stated/particular yield response function s. Locally, site-clearly stated/particular yield response functions can clearly show/include fixed effects that cleary model the activity 
 of site (typical and expected) (numbers that change/things that change) left out from previous 
 recommendations. Leaving out any (connected/related) (number or thing that changes) may 
 introduce bias if there exists relationship between included and left out (numbers that change/things that change) (Griliches, 1957; Greene, 
 1990, p. 259). 
 The existing research base for (related to scientific farming) input recommendations was developed long before (related to space or existing in space) data 
 management technologies came into being. The results may partially explain the findings that VRA 
 input management tends to be (losing money) on US 
 field crops (Swinton and Lowenberg-DeBoer, 1998). 
 The following section illustrates how (something left out) of (connected/related) site (typical and expected) (numbers that change/things that change) can influence limit/guideline guesses as well as the value of site sampling 
 information. 
 
 5. An illustration of information value from 
 (related to space or existing in space) crop yield response data 
 A (experience-based thinking) (testing out) was developed to illustrate 
 the difference in the money-making ability of VRA technology 
 used under (related to a large area) produce response information against/compared to/or VRA technology used with site-specific produce response information. Think about/believe a farm composed of one 
 square field divided into a grid of (41 x 41) = 1681 ha. 
 The (related to scientific farming) (features/ qualities/ traits) of each grid cell are (a mixture of things that are all pretty much the same), but change/differ  across cells. Crop yield (y) is a 
 function f of three (numbers that change/things that change) only: applied nitrogen (material that makes plants grow better) (x), soil nitrogen (c 1), and soil depth (cz) ,which 
 is unobservable. Soil nitrogen c 1 ranges between 3 
 and 82 kg/ha, while soil depth cz ranges between 1 
 and 82 em. The (related to space or existing in space) distribution of soil nitrogen,

 c 1, appears in Fig. 1. 1 To maintain simpleness, it is 
 assumed that no unable to control (random/including random data points) (numbers that change/things that change) z 
 affect yield. Eq. (2) presents the assumed form of the 
 yield response function: 
 f(x , c 1, c2) = 2 + 0.6[x + c r]- 0.0004[x + c d 
 
 +0.004c2 - 0.00001[c2f

 +0.001[x + c 1lc2. 
 
 Fig. 2 shows corn yield response to total nitrogen, 
 x + c 1, given soil depth levels of cz = 30 and cz = 
 50. The figure shows how the functional form in 
 Eq. (2) hints that deeper soil leads to a higher and 
 steeper yield response to total nitrogen . 
 The 1681 ha in the field are indexed by (i, j), where 
 i , j = 1, ... , 41 , such that hectare (i, j) is the ith 
 hectare to the east of the western border of the field , 
 and the jth hectare to the north of the southern border.

 The (related to space or existing in space) di stributions of c 1 and cz were produced in TUBA

 an identical in all directions huge semivariogram with a mean of 45 em, 
 a variance of 140 cm 2 , and a range of (related to space or existing in space) relationship of 3 1 
 units. These di stributions were chosen to refl ect roughl y the sort 
 of (related to space or existing in space) difference/different version in (features/ qualities/ traits) obvious in many Midwestern 
 US farm fi elds.

 where ai,J = 2 + 0.004c2i,J - 0.00001c&#126;i,J' /3i,J = 
 0.6 + 0.001c2i,J, and Yi,J = -0.0004 for i, j = 
 1, ... , 41. Eq. (3) shows that every one of the 1681 ha 
 in the field has it's "own" yield response to total nitrogen, /i,J (x, C]i,J ). The yield response of hectare (i, 
 j) depends on the limits/guidelines ai,J, f3i,J, and Yi,J. The 
 producer is assumed to be able to sample the value 
 of soil-carried nitrogen C]i,J in each hectare (i, }), but 
 since (number or thing that changes) C2 is unobservable, it is not possible for 
 the producer to guess the yield response function 
 in Eq. (2) directly. However, the producer can run (or 
 hire a consultant to run) (related to scientific farming) experiments that 
 provide data with which to guess the coefficients 
 in Eq. (3) for every (i, j) for which an experiment 
 is run. 
 Six pictures/situations illustrate how different levels of 
 on-farm (trying new things out/testing ideas scientifically) can be used to guess the 
 coefficients of the yield response functions in different parts of the field. For simpleness, it is, at first, 
 assumed that this information can be gotten at no 
 added/more cost. 
 - Full information picture/situation: (related to scientific farming) experiments 
 are run on all1681 squares shown in Fig. 3a, creating econometric guesses of all ai,J and f3i,J for 
 1681 
 i, j = 1, ... , 41. These guesses are labeled a l,] 
 and /3l,&#126; 81 . For the purposes of the illustration, it 
 is assumed that these guesses are perfectly accu1681 
 rate, so a,.1681 
 = a i' 1Â· and a.l,j 
 . = f3 i' 1Â· , f or 1,. J. = 
 '1 
 1, ... , 41. (In reality, of course, econometric esti- 
 
 mates of any cell's yield response function limits/guidelines would not be perfectly correct because of the 
 effects of unseen (numbers that change/things that change) and measurement 
 error. In our tests, we ignore econometric guess error to focus on the money-based effects of 
 information.) 
 - Partial information pictures/situations: (related to scientific farming) experiments are run only on a grid sample of the 1681 ha 
 in the field. Sampling densities include 441, 121, 
 81, 36 and 25 ha, as shown in Fig. 3b-f, creating 
 perfect knowledge of ai,J and f3i,J for the hectares 
 on which experiments were run. This information 
 is then (related to space or existing in space)ly figured out (kriged), to guess 
 the ai,J and f3i,J in each of the remaining squares. 
 In the (testing out), the kriged guesses, called aL 
 and f3L (i, j = 1, ... , 41; k is the sampling density) were based upon a fitted huge semivariogram using the Geostatistics for the (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) Sciences software package (Gamma Design 
 Software). 
 The information set for each sampling density k is 
 represented ISk = a}{,], f3L, 
 a}_2, /3&#126;,2 
 a&#126; 1 ,4 1 , /3Z1,41 , 1,41 }, with k = 25, 36, 81, 121,441, 
 1681. With information set ISk, the farmer gets an 
 guess of the individual yield response function for 
 every hectare (i, j) in the field:

 The producer's profit (biggest increase/best possible extent) problem can be 
 (said again) from Eq. (1), depending on his or her information set and the availability of either changeable rate 
 (material that makes plants grow better) application technology (VRA) or uniform 
 rate application (URA). A farmer who has VRA is assumed to choose a nitrogen rate on every hectare so

 Substituting (7) and (8) into the unemotional functions 
 in (5) and (6) gives the producer's gross margins over 
 applied nitrogen costs for all six information pictures/situations, for VRA and URA, (match up each pair of items in order). The results are 
 summarized in Fig. 4. 
 Two important results are obvious in Fig. 4. First, 
 given any amount of costless information available, 
 the gross margin over the applied nitrogen costs are 
 higher under VRA than under URA. The difference 
 between these two shows the maximum amount that 
 the farmer would be willing to pay to use VRA instead 
 of URA. For every amount of information shown in 
 Fig. 4 (i.e. to know for sure the yield response 
 functions for 25, 36, 81, 121, 441, and 1681 of the 
 cells), the farmer is willing to pay a lot for VRA. 
 Second, the value of VRA against/compared to/or URA increases 
 with the amount of information that the farmer possesses. More information about site-specific produce 
 response makes VRA worth more. Fig. 4 reports 
 the result that given information set IS25, the farmer 
 would be willing to pay US$_$ 1.60/ha for VRA. But

 The solutions to the (biggest increase/best possible extent) problems in (6) 
 are the (money-based)/cheaply best input application rates 
 
 870 
 
 from 441 to 1681. But it actually decreases (a) little between 25 and 
 36 units of information. This latter result has been made possible 
 by the way in which we have defined "amount of information" 
 in this (experience-based thinking) example. As can bee seen in Figs. 3e and f, 
 information not only about more cells, but about different cells 
 are drawn from when 36 experiments are run instead of 25. 
 Had we decided to get information from 36 cells by first using 
 the information received/got from the original 25 and then adding 
 information from 11 more cells, the result would have been that 
 the gross margin over applied nitrogen costs would have increased 
 (a) little when the number of experiments run went from 25 to 36.

 with more information, this desire-to-pay for 
 VRA increases, up to US$_$ 7.30/ha when the farmer 
 possesses full information (i.e. has information set 
 IS168l ). This hints that the not important value of information is positive when the farmer possesses VRA. 
 But in the example, the not important value of information 
 to the farmer using URA is basically zero-using 
 URA, the farmer can make nearly as much money with 
 IS2s as he can with complete information (IS16s1). 3 
 So, VRA makes information worth more. These 
 results come about because changeable rate technology and information are money-based (completes/goes along with) for 
 the farmer. Having more information shifts demand 
 (desire-to-pay) for changeable rate technology out, 
 and having changeable rate technology available shifts 
 demand (desire-to-pay) for information out. 
 The gut feeling behind these results is plain/honest/easy. 
 Farmers who farm using URA have to choose one 
 nitrogen application rate for their whole field. The best nitrogen application rate under URA will be too 
 high for some parts of the field and too low for other 
 parts, but on average, it will be profit-making the most of. 
 Roughly speaking, the farming using URA wants to 
 know the shape of the "average" of the yield response 
 curves. To get (well enough/good enough/in a smart way) good guesses of the coefficients of the "average" yield response curve does 
 not take much information; a sample of the true yield 
 response coefficients from 25 cells evenly-spaced 
 throughout the field is large enough to give a very 
 close guess of the field's "average" yield response 
 curve, which the farmer could know perfectly if he or 
 she sampled the whole population of 1681 cells. So, 
 (related to scientific farming) experiments on just 25 of the 1681 ha of 
 the field gave/given almost all the information the 
 URA farmer could use. But a farmer using VRA had 
 use for more information, because he or she could 
 use information about how the produce response curve 
 coefficients in Eq. (3) are (related to space or existing in space)ly distributed. The 
 farmer using VRA wants to know more than the 
 shape of the "average" response curve; he or she 
 benefits from knowing the shapes of every response 
 curve. Learning about the whole distribution of the 
 3 Based on the idea (you think is true) of a single yield response function, 
 Schnitkey et al. (1996) have shown that use of an money-based 
 decision rule to decide/figure out the URA input rate with site-specific 
 sampling (e.g., of CJ) results in a different (more money-making) rate 
 than one that is based upon whole-field average soil sampling. 
 
 243 
 
 1681 response curves takes much more information 
 than simply finding a good guess of the mean 
 response. Therefore, farming under VRA is much 
 more information intensive than farming under URA. 
 
 6. Ends/end results 
 Producers and farms remain fascinated 
 with quality farm-related technology. Adoption, however, has fell behind the expectations of many experts. There are many good reasons for slow adoption 
 of quality farm-related technology, not least of which 
 is that (people who work to find information) and farmers have at first focused 
 very on in-field benefits from variable-rate (material that makes plants grow better) application received/made from when (related to a large area) average (material that makes plants grow better) recommendations are used. This initial failure 
 of focus is understandable; these (related to a large area) average (material that makes plants grow better) recommendations have been used for 20 years 
 with ordinary application technology, and it was 
 natural to use them at first to manage changeable rate 
 application. But our research hints that because 
 VRA technology has increased the value that can be 
 added from site-clearly stated/particular data, new methods of developing application rate recommendations are needed. 
 The increased demand for site-clearly stated/particular information brought about by the appearance of quality 
 technology calls for increased supply of site-specific 
 information. A few (people who work to find information) have begun trying 
 to guess site-clearly stated/particular response functions. Malzer 
 et al. (1997) is an early published report of guesses 
 of site-clearly stated/particular yield response functions. Bongiovanni 
 and Lowenberg-DeBoer (2000b) received/got data from 
 Argentine on-farm trials with combine yield monitors 
 sensors, to develop corn nitrogen recommendations 
 that included slope position via (related to space or existing in space) econometric ways of doing things. Hurley et al. (2001) used a geostatistical approach to model left-out site (numbers that change/things that change) and 
 (related to space or existing in space) error relationship in corn response to nitrogen. 
 Swinton et al. (2002) developed topographic indices 
 for wetness and insulation potential from Michigan 
 on-farm trial data to guess site-specific nitrogen 
 response functions. But work in this area is only 
 beginning. 
 Our research shows that the presence of VRA technology makes site-clearly stated/particular information worth more. 
 This hints that two new forms of (related to scientific farming) yield 
 response research are now called for. First, more in-

 (creation and construction/ group of objects) about the meta-response function f(x, c, z) 
 needs to be gathered. This can be done through more 
 long-term area-wide (related to scientific farming) (trying new things out/testing ideas scientifically) 
 that in a planned way differs/changes input levels to study their 
 interaction with site-(features/ qualities/ traits) and (random/including random data points) 
 (numbers that change/things that change) over time. 
 The second type of research called for is that which 
 will enable farmers to measure the site-clearly stated/particular (features/ qualities/ traits) c of their fields cheaply and correctly. For 
 even if the meta-response function is known, farmers 
 need to improve their guesses of Ci,j for each site 
 (i, j) if they are to possess the site-clearly stated/particular response 
 functions f(x, Ci,j, z) on their farms. Farming-based engineering research into finding inexpensive ways to 
 develop maps of the site-specific (typical and expected) levels 
 Ci,j on farms is now well under way. Examples 
 range from research into "on-the-fly" nitrogen stress 
 sensors to research on the measurement of soil electroconductivity. 
 VRA technology may soon make it (able to be done) for a 
 farmer to use on-farm (related to scientific farming) (trying new things out/testing ideas scientifically) to 
 go around the challenge of guessing the meta-response 
 function f(x, c, z) and finding inexpensive ways to 
 map the c (numbers that change/things that change). Through on-farm (related to scientific farming) (trying new things out/testing ideas scientifically), it is possible to guess a site-specific 
 yield response function !i,j (x, z)= f (x, Ci,j, z) without needing to know the meta-response functionf(x, c, 
 z) or getting a map of the farm's site-clearly stated/particular (features/ qualities/ traits) Ci,j. It is a fascinating fact that while quality 
 technology has increased the demand for site-specific 
 information, it also has great possible ability to  increase 
 the supply of site-clearly stated/particular information. For quality 
 technology can greatly reduce the cost of running 
 (related to scientific farming) experiments. Software for VRA equipment 
 and yield monitors is now being developed to automate much of the running of (related to scientific farming) experiments. 
 Combining such on-farm experimental data with a 
 time series of weather data will enable guess 
 of site-clearly stated/particular yield response functions fi,j(X, z) = 
 f(x, Ci,j, z). Farming-based money-flow experts have a long history of guessing output response to input applications. Also, farming-based money-flow experts have developed an important body of research results on information value, based on managing (quality of changing over time or at different places)-usually 
 in time-related settings. With these tools, there exists major possible ability to  develop further benefits from quality 
 farming technologies, including the guess of 
 site-clearly stated/particular response relationships that allow truly 
 
 (related to space or existing in space)ly custom-designed input computer programs and create added 
 value for site-clearly stated/particular information.
