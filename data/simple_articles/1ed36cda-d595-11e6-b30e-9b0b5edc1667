 Abstract 
 Extensification of farming is one of the major factors adding/giving to the destruction of forests in Africa. In 
 Sudan, such flat/left-and-right (act of something getting bigger, wider, etc.) comes at the expense of land gave/reserved to trees and other green plants, by that/in that way 
 causing conditions that are harmful to (able to last/helping the planet) farming-based production. Different factors have added/have given to 
 extensification. Although high money-based returns from crop (mainly (grass grown for food)) production was an important factor 
 encouraging extensification of rainfed mechanized farming, other factors outside farming have also added/gave to 
 that (act of something getting bigger, wider, etc.). This paper uses data from eastern Sudan and an land response model, to identify the most 
 important factors influencing land (act of something getting bigger, wider, etc.). Different measures and forms of risk were used in the land 
 response model. The paper shows how policies in the energy part/area can indirectly influence land (act of something getting bigger, wider, etc.) in the 
 farming-based part/area. 
 
 1. Introduction 
 
 Worsening of valuable things from nature in the developing countries can be thought of as arising for 
 three first (or most important) reasons: (1) clear government 
 policies to make happy domestic needs or to increase 
 exports to earn foreign exchange; (2) misguided 
 management policies that have as their intent the 
 actual protection of valuable things from nature; and (3) the 
 interrelations between other money-based policies 
 
 and the valuable thing from nature base of a country 
 (Bromley, 1986). In this paper we report on scientific research highlighting the third of these 
 things - the interaction of different money-based 
 policies and events that may seem, on the surface, to be unrelated. Specifically, this research 
 illustrates the linkage between energy supply and 
 pricing policy and farming-based extensification that is, the flat/left-and-right (act of something getting bigger, wider, etc.) of farming 
 into forested areas - in eastern Sudan. 1 While

 the clearly stated/particular location of the research is Sudan, almost the same  things exist throughout the Sahel. 
 When imported oil was a cheap source of 
 energy in Sudan, there was very little  (reward or reason for doing something) to 
 clear land for charcoal production. The high cost 
 of land clearing was one of the main factors that 
 protected forested areas against flat/left-and-right (act of something getting bigger, wider, etc.) of rainfed farming (Affan, 1984). 
 However, when oil prices began to rise in the 
 1970's, charcoal suddenly became a competitive 
 energy source for city-based  residents starved of 
 low-priced petroleum products. More than that, the increase in the population of city-based  areas from 
 in-traveling has led to big increases in the 
 demand for charcoal. The later increase in 
 charcoal prices soon cast the forest in a new light 
 to farmers and herders who then began to fully use 
 forests to produce charcoal for city-based  markets. 
 As a result, the increased money/money income potential 
 from clearing land for farming has meant that 
 land-clearing costs no longer act as an obstacle to fast (chopping down trees) for creating 
 plantable land. Because of this, the high returns from charcoal production were guessed to be another 
 important factor adding/giving to the (act of something getting bigger, wider, etc.) of 
 farming into not important lands at the expense of 
 forested areas. This continued (act of something getting bigger, wider, etc.) of rainfed farming in response to important but unintended (rewards or reasons for doing something) can be a serious policy problem 
 facing many poor countries. 
 2. Setting 
 
 The rainfed mechanized farming big plans/layouts/dishonest plans got 
 their start in Sudan in 1944, in an area of about 
 12 000 feddans, 2 mostly to feed troops placed/assigned in East Africa during World War II. The 
 Government then began to encourage the private 
 part/area to participate in these big plans/layouts/dishonest plans. The high 
 money-based returns of early settlers encouraged 
 other people (who were part of a study, etc.) and so resulted in a fairly fast 
 (act of something getting bigger, wider, etc.) of the area cleared for (producing crops/helping something grow). By 
 1985 the total area under rainfed mechanized 
 farming was about 7.4 million feddans (Earl, 
 1985). While called mechanized farming, in fact 
 2 
 
 feddan = 1.04 area of land "' 0.42 ha. 
 
 only land preparation and causing/producing are mechanized. Weeding (if any) and collecting are manual operations. The grain is cut by hand and 
 beat/separated by unmoving harvesters (Ibnouf, 1985). 
 Four crops are grown - dura ((grass grown for food)), sesame, 
 millet and cotton. However, dura accounts for 
 80-90% of the land area (Affan, 1984). Sesame is 
 the second most important crop, while millet and 
 cotton are grown in very limited areas. This (popular thing/general way things are going) 
 seems (constant/not going away) over time. 
 On the rainfed mechanized big plans/layouts/dishonest plans, land is 
 leased by the Government to farmers in lots of 
 1000-2000 feddans for a renewable period of 25 
 years at a (in name only/very small amount) land rent (LS0.05 per feddan 
 per year 3 - about $0.13 per area of land - in 
 1976). These farms are referred to as bordering/limiting 
 farms. In addition to the bordering/limiting farms, there 
 are large areas of land that have been cleared 
 without approval; these areas are referred to 
 as undemarcated farms. Whether approved ((showed the limit)) or not, the typical farming practice is 
 continuous cropping - defined here as putting 
 cleared land under production of the same crop 
 (dura) for (one after the other) years without unplanteding (or 
 with a very short unplanted period). Shifting (producing crops/helping something grow) to new areas (which are sometimes not important 
 lands) happens when yields decline below a money-making level. Although some (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) safeguards 
 - such as shelterbelts and crop rotation - are 
 needed/demanded by the Mechanized Farming Corporation, these practices are rarely followed. In general, no (material that makes plants grow better)s, insecticides or bug-killers are 
 applied to these cropped lands and so it comes as 
 no surprise that, over time, working well declines. 4 
 3. Scientific model 
 An land response model was used to study 
 the land (act of something getting bigger, wider, etc.) in the rainfed mechanized 
 
 LS, Sudanese pound= $2.70 in 1976. 
 (material that makes plants grow better)s, insecticides and bug-killers are imported and 
 made available only to watered big plans/layouts/dishonest plans. Following the rotation prescribed by the Mechanized Farming Corporation 
 (MFC) would eliminate (or at least reduce) the need for these 
 chemicals in the rainfed mechanized farms. However, easy 
 access to land and lack of police discourage farmers to follow the MFC's recommendations.

 part/area of Sudan. In most of the econometric 
 studies of land response it has been recognized that risk with respect to price, produce and 
 income influences farmers' production decisions 
 (Adesina and Brorsen, 1987; Behrman, 1968; 
 Chavas and Holt, 1990; Just, 1974; Ryan, 1977; 
 Trail, 1978; Wilson et al., 1980; Wolgin, 1975). In 
 these studies, risk has been expressed in a 'symmetric' form which thinks about/believes both very high and 
 very low returns as undesirable (Markowitz, 1970). 
 However, one expects producers to be more worried about negative than positive mistakes 
 from a targeted price, yield or income. Therefore, 
 an 'asymmetric' risk analysis that uses only the 
 negative mistakes may be preferred to a matching risk analysis (Tronstad and McNeill, 1989). 
 Models guessed in this paper use both 
 matching and not mirror-images forms of risk. Different (numbers that change/things that change) were used to represent riskiness of 
 price or production. These (numbers that change/things that change) range from 
 simple expressions such as a moving range or 
 total difference between expected and actual 
 price (Brennan, 1980) to more complicated expressions such as moving standard mistakes 
 (Behrman, 1968; Just, 1974). 
 Dura accounts for 80-90% of the land area 
 under the rainfed mechanized part/area (Affan, 
 1984). Because of this, the focus here is on the land 
 response for dura only. Millet and cotton are 
 grown on very limited areas. Therefore, difference/different version 
 in prices of millet and cotton can be expected not 
 to affect the land response for dura. Sesame is 
 the second crop in rainfed farming and shares 
 with millet and cotton the remaining 10-20% of 
 the land area. Therefore, the first models included sesame price, sesame price risk and the 
 covariance between dura and sesame prices as 
 explanatory (numbers that change/things that change). However, nested F-tests 
 could not reject the null guess that all coefficients on sesame (numbers that change/things that change) were (at the same time) 
 equal to zero. Because of this, these (numbers that change/things that change) are not 
 included in the scientific model. The price of 
 charcoal is included because farmers can make 
 use of cleared trees to produce charcoal. This is 
 expected to be an added (reward or reason for doing something) for farmers to 
 clear more land for (producing crops/helping something grow). The money/money income from 
 charcoal can offset, or at least reduce, the cost of 
 land clearance (Earl, 1985). The scientific model, 
 
 195 
 
 based on Behrman (1968), is given by Eq. (1):

 and, for time period t, ln(A 1 ) is the natural 
 logarithm of dura-(helped to grow) area in feddan; EDP 1 
 is expected dura real price 5 in 0.01 Sudanese 
 pounds (LS) per kilogram; C 1 is cost of dura 
 production in LS per feddan; CP 1 is charcoal price 
 in LS per 80-lb sack 6 ; EDY1 is expected dura 
 yield in kilogram per feddan; ERF1 is expected 
 rainfall in millimeter; DPR 1 is dura price risk; and 
 RFR 1 is rainfall risk. Money-based explanation provides 
 little help in choosing the appropriate functional 
 form and so different functional forms were tried. 
 The form in Eq. (1) gives the best fit of the data. 
 The data used in this study are limited to the 
 eastern area (Gedarif) which contains the 
 largest area gave/reserved to rainfed mechanized farming. The data do not tell the difference between 
 (showed the limit) and undemarcated big plans/layouts/dishonest plans. More 
 complete data were available for the period 
 1969-1985 and were used for this study. Data 
 sources include different (books, magazines, etc.). Data on 
 areas helped grow, rainfall and produces /gives up are from the 
 Mechanized Farming Corporation (MFC, 1984). 
 The Department of Farming-based Money flow and 
 Statistics (1986, 1987, 1989) gave/given data on 
 areas helped grow, produces and production costs, while 
 the Department of Statistics (undated) is the 
 source of data on prices. Data on personal price 
 index and charcoal prices are from the National 
 Energy Management (1987). Charcoal prices 
 for the eastern area were not available. Because of this, 
 
 The personal price index was used to (lower/flatten from losing air) dura price 
 and cost of production. While a price index for farming-based 
 mputs would have been a better index for (lowering/flattening from losing air) costs of 
 production, lack of data prevented this approach.

 we used charcoal prices for the area of control/area of land of Khartoum, a main market for the charcoal produced 
 in Gedarif. Costs of production data are increased/added with data from Thimm (1979) and El 
 Hadari and Suliman (1980). The data are guesses based on thin slice surveys conducted 
 every year by the different government departments. 
 The expected real price (EDPt) is assumed to 
 be a linear function of last year's real price (opt_ 1) 
 according to the maximum-chance-guessed 
 equation: 7

 where t-values are given in parentheses. 
 Farmers need not form expectations about 
 charcoal price because charcoal making can go ahead quickly. Therefore, the price of charcoal at 
 time t is the watched/followed market price in that year. 
 Land preparation and causing/producing costs are a major 
 part of production costs and both are known to 
 farmers before land portion decisions are taken. 
 Hence, production costs are treated as non-(random/including random data points). The expected dura produce and expected 
 rainfall are assumed to be last year's produce and 
 rainfall, (match up each pair of items in order). 8 
 Two forms of risk analysis (matching and 
 not mirror-images) are used. Within each form two (numbers that change/things that change) (simple and complex) are used to represent 
 risk. After now, Xt is dura real price or rainfall, 
 while EXt refers to the expected value. For both 
 price and rainfall risk, the following risk (numbers that change/things that change) 
 are defined. The matching-simple measure of 
 risk (sxR&#126;) is the (value of a number, ignoring its sign) of the difference 
 between the actual and expected values for the 
 previous year: 
 SXR&#126; 
 
 = abs(Xt-l- EXt_ 1 ) 
 
 (3) 
 
 7 A Durbin h-test pointed to/showed first-order autocorrelation. The 
 equation was, therefore, guessed by maximum chance. 
 8 Last year's rainfall gave better (related to studying numbers) results than the 
 average rainfall over the last 2, 3 and 4 years. We also 
 moved backward yield on time and experimented with the expected 
 values as a substitute for expected yield. However, yield from the 
 previous year gave better (related to studying numbers) results. 
 
 On the other hand, the matching-complex measure of risk (sxR&#126;) is a moving standard moving away 
 of X 1 over the previous three years (Behrman, 
 1968): 
 
 sxR&#126; =

 where 
 k=1,2,3 
 
 The not mirror-images-simple measure of risk (ASXR&#126;) 
 equals the (value of a number, ignoring its sign) of the difference between actual and expected values for the previous 
 year if the expected value goes beyond the actual 
 corresponding value and zero otherwise:

 Money-based explanation hints that the supply of a 
 valuable thing increases as its (expected) price increases (3{ 1 &amp;gt; 0). An increase in production costs 
 is expected to decrease the land for dura 
 (3{ 2 &amp;lt; 0). By converting the cleared trees into 
 charcoal the farmer can make some small (money made/good thing received), 
 or at least reduce the net costs of land clearance. 
 Therefore, we guess that an increase in 
 charcoal price will cause farmers to clear and 
 help grow more land (3{ 3 &amp;gt; 0). An increase in expected yield (EDY) will mean an increase in expected income and so 3{ 4 is expected to be positive. Because we are concerned here with rainfed 
 farming, the area helped grow is expected to 
 increase as farmers expect higher rainfall (3{ 5 &amp;gt; 0). 
 Assuming that farmers are (not wanting to do anything dangerous), an increase in perceptions of risk (oPR or RFR) is 
 expected to shift the land curve to the left 
 (36{ &amp;lt; 0; 37{ &amp;lt; 0).

 Results of the non-nested ]-test 
 
 Four versions of Eq. (1) were guessed by 
 maximum chance procedures (Judge et a!., 
 1982). The four versions differ only in the risk 
 (numbers that change/things that change) (oPR and RFR). In the same way/in that way, these four 
 versions are the matching-simple, matchingcomplex, not mirror-images-simple and not mirror-imagescomplex risk models. The matching form of risk 
 is tested against the not mirror-images form, and the 
 simple measure of risk is tested against the complex measure using the non-nested ]-test (Davidson and MacKinnon, 1981). The results of the 
 pairwise ]-test are presented in Table 1. Generally, Table 1 shows that the not mirror-images-risk models were preferred to the matching-risk models 
 and the simple measures of risk were preferred to 
 complex measures (for more detail, see Elnagheeb and Bromley, 1991). 
 Table 2 presents the maximum chance guesses of the four risk models along with the 
 guesses of the ordinary non-risk model. In

 collinearity between expected rainfall and expected produce. 
 An interesting result is that charcoal price has 
 a positive coefficient which is significant at the 
 5% level of importance in all models. This finding supports the guess that higher charcoal 
 prices act as an added (reward or reason for doing something) for farmers to 
 clear land for (producing crops/helping something grow). The result may explain, 
 at least partially, why farmers in the rainfed 
 mechanized big plans/layouts/dishonest plans do not leave a part of/amount of 
 their land in trees for shelterbelts as needed/demanded by 
 the Mechanized Farming Corporation. The result 
 also illustrates the relationships between the 
 energy and farming-based parts/areas. Policies such as 
 import restrictions on oil products and twisted/partially untrue/lied about 
 prices of energy useful things/valuable supplies, influence charcoal 
 prices and indirectly influence land-clearing costs 
 - and so influence the total land under dura 
 production. 
 If farmers are risk-(able to reply or react/quick to respond) (probably 
 (not wanting to do anything dangerous)), they should help grow smaller areas as 
 price and rainfall risk increase. This guess is 
 supported by all risk models in Table 2. The 
 coefficients on the price and rainfall risk (numbers that change/things that change) are negative in all models and significantly 
 different from zero except for the not mirror-imagessimple measure of rainfall risk. Further, a nested 
 F-test rejected, at the 10% level of importance, 
 the null guess that both coefficients on price 
 and rainfall risk (numbers that change/things that change) are (at the same time) 
 equal to zero. The guess is rejected in all 
 risk models. The F(2, 8) values are 4.16, 3.72, 
 7.15 and 6.83 for the matching-simple, matching-complex, not mirror-images-simple and not mirror-imagescomplex risk models, (match up each pair of items in order) (the counted

 Only significant (at the 10% or less level) elasticities are 
 reported. 
 
 a 
 
 F-value is 3.11). Because of this, our results suggest that 
 both price and rainfall risks are important decision (numbers that change/things that change) in the meant level of dura production in the rainfed farming big plans/layouts/dishonest plans of Sudan. 
 As expected, (something left out) of the risk (numbers that change/things that change) 
 (created unfair thinking in)/(unfair-thinking) the guesses of the coefficients of the 
 remaining (numbers that change/things that change) and as a result (created unfair thinking in)/(unfair-thinking) the 
 guesses of their (pertaining to each person or thing) elasticities. Since the 
 expected dura price (EoP 1 ) is assumed to be a 
 linear function of last year's price (oP 1 _ 1), the 
 ability to stretch of DP1 _ 1 can be gotten from (see Eq. 
 2): 
 E 
 
 =(a ln(A 1 )jaoP 1 _ 1 )(oP*) 
 = 0.566671(a ln(A 1 )/aEoP)(oP*) 
 
 (7) 
 
 where op* is the average of DP1 _ 1. The land 
 response elasticities for the risk and non-risk 
 models are reported in Table 3. 
 Table 3 shows that dura land response was 
 price-inelastic; a 1% increase in real dura price 
 resulted in about 0.4-0.5% increase in dura 
 land. (something left out) of the risk (numbers that change/things that change) has led to 
 underestimated price ability to stretch - except for the 
 not mirror-images-simple risk model. This result is agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with results from other research (Adesina 
 and Brorsen, 1987; Hurt and Garcia, 1982; Ryan, 
 1977). Therefore, any policy decisions related to 
 the price of dura in a non-risk model would likely 
 result in underestimated dura land response. 
 Both price-risk and rainfall-risk elasticities from 
 the not mirror-images-simple risk model are the least (in 
 (value of a number, ignoring its sign)) when compared to those received/got 
 from the other risk models. The land response 
 elasticities from the matching-complex and 
 not mirror-images-complex risk models compare positively/well except for the risk (numbers that change/things that change). The not mirror-images-complex risk model gives the highest elasticities, in (value of a number, ignoring its sign), with respect to the risk 
 (numbers that change/things that change). These results suggest that dura land 
 seems more (able to reply or react/quick to respond) to not mirror-images than to 
 matching price and rainfall risk. 
 Although price risk is found to be an important decision (number or thing that changes), its ability to stretch is smaller, in 
 (value of a number, ignoring its sign), than the price ability to stretch in all risk 
 models. This result gives/agrees rather well with that 
 found by Adesina and Brorsen (1987), Winter 
 and Whittaker (1979) and Ryan (1977).

 Table 3 also shows that dura land was as 
 (able to reply or react/quick to respond) to cost of production as it was to dura 
 price. This result is important because a good 
 part of the costs of production is the cost of 
 gasoline which is paid-for by the government. 
 Hence, the government can directly influence the 
 dura land through controlling both the amount 
 and price of gasoline.

 5. Ends/end results 
 
 Data from the rainfed mechanized farming 
 part/area of Sudan were used to guess an land 
 response model for dura ((grass grown for food)). Models that 
 use matching and not mirror-images forms of risk 
 using different (numbers that change/things that change) (simple and complex) to 
 measure risk were guessed. 
 Dura land increased with dura's expected 
 price, or expected produce and decreased with costs 
 of production. Sesame prices were not found to 
 influence dura land. An increase in charcoal 
 price could be an added (reward or reason for doing something) for farmers to 
 increase dura land. Therefore, policies that 
 directly influence charcoal prices - e.g. oil import 
 restrictions - should think about/believe the hits/effects of 
 charcoal pricing on land (act of something getting bigger, wider, etc.). Although 
 production of charcoal will save the country some 
 badly needed foreign exchange, it will have an 
 expansion-related effect on the dura land. This 
 process of (chopping down trees) will everitually have a 
 negative effect on the production of charcoal 
 itself as more trees are destroyed. 
 Farmers in the rainfed mechanized farming 
 were found to be (able to reply or react/quick to respond) to risk in prices and 
 rainfall. (something left out) of risk from land response 
 models would likely lead to underestimated price 
 elasticities. Price and rainfall risk negatively influence dura land. Because of this, policies to reduce 
 dura price (quality of changing over time or at different places) should think about/believe the likely 
 land-increasing effect of such policies. Because of this, 
 for any policy that leads to farming-based (act of something getting bigger, wider, etc.), the benefits from such an (act of something getting bigger, wider, etc.) in total 
 dura production should be compared to its costs 
 in terms of (the health of the Earth/the surrounding conditions)al worsening from 
 fast (chopping down trees) (Simpson, 1978; El 
 Tayeb and Lewandowski, 1983; El Taheir, 1987; 
 Whitney, 1987).
