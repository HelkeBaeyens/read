 Abstract 
 This paper represents a energetic (detailed description of exactly what is required) of the Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS) based on recent developments on 
 cointegration ways of doing things and error correction models. Based on Greek meat consumption data over the period 1958-1993, it 
 was found that the proposed creation (does as expected) well on both possible and (related to studying numbers) grounds, as the possible properties 
 of evenness and matching are supported by the data and the LeChatelier way of thinking/basic truth/rule holds. (without any concern about/having nothing to do with) the time (line in the distance where the Earth and sky meet), 
 beef and chicken may be thought about/believed as expensive things/special privileges while mutton-lamb and pork as needs. In the short-run, beef was found 
 to have price elastic demand, pork an almost unitary ability to stretch, whereas mutton-lamb, chicken and sausages had inelastic 
 demands; in the long-run, beef, and pork were found to have a demand ability to stretch greater than one, whereas mutton-lamb, 
 chicken, and sausages still had inelastic demands. All meat items are found to be substitutes to each other except chicken and 
 mutton-lamb, and pork and chicken. Â©2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

 1. Introduction 
 The Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS), developed by Deaton and Muellbauer (1980), is by far the 
 most commonly used demand system (detailed description of exactly what is required) in 
 the last 15 years. During the period 1980-1991, 89 
 scientific applications used the AIDS in demand studies (Buse, 1994). At the same time, a lot of effort has 
 been gave/reserved into two connected problems connected with the (detailed description of exactly what is required) and the guess of the 
 AIDS: the first one has to do with the choice between 
 its linear or non-linear (detailed description of exactly what is required) and the second 
 with the choice of an group valuable thing price de* Corresponding author. Tel.: +30-31-843-095;

 flator (Pashardes, 1993; Buse, 1994; Moschini, 1995). 
 (even though there is the existence of) these problems, the AIDS remains one of the 
 better choice available for scientific demand analysis. Until (not very long ago), the AIDS has been guessed with 
 ordinary econometric ways of doing things, (in other words) OLS, SUR 
 and MLE, without paying any attention to either the 
 (related to studying numbers) properties of the data or the energetic (detailed description of exactly what is required) arising from time series analysis. 
 (not very long ago) though, two studies have tried to includes energetic elements into the AIDS by relying 
 on the (related to studying numbers) properties of the data. Balcombe and 
 Davis (1996), on the one hand, proposed the accepted/standard cointegrating moving backward procedure for guessing 
 the AIDS. This procedure is used in cases where valuable thing prices follow a distributed lag process, or there 
 is a seasonal pattern. On the other hand, Karagiannis and Velentzas ( 1997), organized and listed the possible use of

 an error correction model (ECM) of the AIDS. Based 
 on the time series properties of the data and as long 
 as cointegration between the dependent and a linear 
 combination of (things that you control (like study times), that cause other things to change (like test scores)) is secured/made sure of, an 
 ECM for the AIDS can be established and econometrically guessed it with an repeating/repetitive (appearing to be) unrelated 
 moving backward (ISUR) procedure. For once-a-year time series 
 data, the last thing just mentioned approach seems more appropriate. 
 This paper builds on previous work by Karagiannis 
 and Velentzas (1997) and a little bit expands it. 
 We further explore the way(s) of doing things for testing and 
 setting an error correction form of demand systems 
 by presenting a more complete set of different tests 
 that can be used to establish long-run demand relationships. More than that, given the structure of an ECM, shortand long-run demand responses can be carefully studied. In 
 the applied partner, the paper provides scientific 
 (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) and measures of short- and long-run ability to stretch guesses for an ECM-AIDS for meat demand in 
 Greece over the period 1958-1993. 
 Meat demand has been of major interest in applied 
 demand analysis for many countries over the last few years. 
 There are some studies for US (e.g. Beers and 
 Unnevehr, 1988, 1993; Moschini and Meilke, 1989; 
 Moschini and Vissa, 1993; Moschini et al., 1994; 
 Nayga and Capps, 1994; Brester and Schroeder, 1995; 
 Kesavan and Buhr, 1995; Holt and Goodwin, 1997), 
 for Canada (Chalfant et al., 1991; Chen and Veeman, 
 1991; Reynolds and Goddard, 1991; Xu and Veeman, 
 1996), for Japan (Hayes et al., 1990), for Australia 
 (Cashin, 1991), for Saudi Arabia (Al-Kahtani and 
 Sofian, 1995), for UK (Bewley and Young, 1987; 
 Burton and Young, 1992; Burton et al., 1994, 1996; 
 Tiffin and Tiffin, 1999), for France (Fulponi, 1989), 
 for Italy (Dono and Thompson, 1994), for Norway 
 (Rickertsen, 1996), and for Greece (Karagiannis et 
 al., 1996). 
 The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The 
 scientific model and the econometric results are presented in the following two sections, (match up each pair of items in order). 
 Ability to stretch guesses are reported in the Section 4. 
 Ending/deciding statements follow. 
 
 2. Scientific modeling 
 In the later analysis, it is assumed that people' preferences are weakly separatable with respect 
 
 to meat, and so, a two-stage money-planning process is im&#126; 
 plied. In the first stage, people decide how much 
 of their total expense will be set apart and given out to meat, 
 and then, in the second stage, the demand for each 
 meat item is figured out by/decided by the prices of the individual 
 meat items and meat expenses. The AIDS is compatible with this procedure since it groups across 
 products (that are bought and sold)  under the idea (you think is true) of weak separability of 
 preferences. A linear (creation and construction/ group of objects) of the AIDS is used 
 in budget-share form: 
 
 where 
 
 si 
 
 is the budget-share of the ith valuable thing, 
 
 p j is the price of the jth valuable thing, m represents 
 total food expense and P is an group price 
 
 index. In the above equation, (being like a line) rises from the 
 way of specifying the group price index, which 
 in the linear creation of the AIDS is treated as 
 (coming from the outside of something). Most often the group price index is 
 came close to by the Stone's price index, the use of 
 which causes (unexpected differences, missing things, or mistakes) in limit/guideline guesses 
 (Pashardes, 1993; Buse, 1994; Moschini, 1995). These 
 (unexpected differences, missing things, or mistakes) are, however, more serious in micro 
 rather than group data (Pashardes, 1993). (not very long ago), 
 Asche and Wessells (1997), have shown that the AIDS 
 and the linearized AIDS representations are identical 
 at the point of guess as long as the prices in 
 the system are (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy)ized to one. 
 Following Karagiannis and Velentzas (1997), first 
 of all it is necessary to (ask lots of questions about/try to find the truth about) the time-series properties of data used in Eq. (1) before specifying the 
 most appropriate energetic form, in order to be able to 
 formally test whether the long-run demand relationships are (money-based)/cheaply meaningful or only false. 
 At first, the number of unit roots should be identified 
 for each individual time-series (i.e. the order of (combination of different things together that work as one unit)). This may be done by using either the 
 Dickey-Fuller, the increased Argue-Fuller (Dickey 
 and Fuller, 1981), the Philips-Perron (Phillips, 1987; 
 Perron, 1988), or the Johansen test. A fault/problem of 
 the Johansen procedure in the case of applied personal demand analysis is that there is no good  information to leave out/keep out some vectors as possibly (not agreeing/not happening in the same way) whenever more than one cointegrated vector is found. This is because the sign of the elements 
 of the cointegrated vectors, pointing to/showing substitutability 
 
 31 
 
 G. Karagiannis et al./Agricultural Money flow 22 (2000) 29-35 
 
 or (completing/matching) behavior between products (that are bought and sold), cannot a 
 priori be restricted. Neither the sign of the elements 
 going along with/matching up to own-price effects is (good) enough to leave out/keep out some of the cointegrated vectors, as even a positive sign may under certain facts or conditions (that surround someone) result in a 
 downward sloping demand. For these reasons, the use 
 of the other three tests is recommended. 
 Wherever both S; and the vector of explanatory 
 (numbers that change/things that change) are (having different things working together as one unit) on the same order, cointegration can be established for all meat items. However, 
 it is also possible to have a cointegrated moving backward 
 even though the (numbers that change/things that change) of interest have different 
 time series properties and so, a different order of 
 integration. According to Granger representation true idea, a linear combination of series with a different 
 order of (combination of different things together that work as one unit) may consist a cointegrated moving backward. Therefore, final/best time-series properties are not 
 a necessary condition to go ahead further. If, however, 
 cointegration cannot be established for at least one 
 share equation, we cannot go ahead further and more 
 likely a different functional (detailed description of exactly what is required) may be used 
 or the data set should be enlarged. 
 Given the low power of static cointegration tests to 
 unfairly treat different guess, a energetic 
 modeling procedure recommended by Banerjee et al. 
 (1986) and Kremers et al. (1992), may also be used 
 to test for cointegration between expense, valuable thing prices, and real expense. According to this 
 way(s) of doing things, at a first instance an ECM is created 
 and guessed. Then, the guess that the coefficient 
 of the error correction term is not (meaningful numbers) is tested by using a traditional t-test. If the null 
 guess is not rejected, the series concerned are not 
 cointegrated. Otherwise, the existence of cointegration 
 between the (connected/related) (numbers that change/things that change) is secured/made sure of. In the presence of possible autocorrelation, which may be a cause 
 of non-stationarity of extras/payments, stationarity may also 
 be examined by using Box-Pierce Q-statistic. (not being there; not being present) 
 of (one after the other) relationship means that the guessed extras/payments 
 are unmoving suggesting that the (numbers that change/things that change) concerned 
 are cointegrated. 
 Anyway, in the above three cases an ECM version of the AIDS can be set up and guessed using a (appearing to be) unrelated moving backward (SUR) procedure, which (changes to make better/changes to fit new conditions) for cross-equation (happening at the same time) relationship and as a result takes into account 
 the optimization process behind any demand system. 
 At this stage, the (something forced on people/an inconvenient situation) of matching and linear

 evenness restrictions can be (related to numbers) tested. To 
 use it further, a budget-share equation, which 
 in this case is that of sausages, should be left out/kept out 
 (adding-up property). Since SUR is sensitive to the 
 left out/kept out equation, the procedure should be cycled-through. 
 The process of cycle secures/makes sure of that the received/got guesses asymptotically approach those of the maximum 
 chance method (Judge et al., 1980). 
 
 3. Econometric results 
 In the scientific analysis, once-a-year time-series data 
 on food expenses are received/got from a few issues of the National Accounts, published by the 
 National (related to studying numbers) Service of Greece. Current and 
 constant (at 1970 prices) meat expenses are grouped into five categories: beef (BE); mutton and 
 lamb (ML); chicken (CH); pork (PO); and sausages 
 (SA). The price index going along with/matching up to each meat 
 group is received/made from by dividing current by constant 
 expenses. 
 The results related to the time-series properties 
 of these data are reported in Table 1. Based on a 
 Phillips-Perron test (Phillips, 1987; Perron, 1988), 
 the guess that all the (numbers that change/things that change) in Eq. (1) contain 
 
 32

 In Eq. (2), !':i refers to the difference operator, ftit-l 
 are the guessed extras/payments from cointegration equations, and Ai &amp;lt; 0. At this stage, there are two different guess procedures: the two-step method of 
 Engle and Granger (1987), and a (not going in a straight line) moving backward 
 way of doing things by substituting (1) for /Lit-! in (2). The Engle and Granger's (Engle and Granger, 1987) two-step 
 method is applied by substituting the guessed limits/guidelines values from the cointegration Eq. (1) into the 
 ECM equation to get limit/guideline guesses in Eq. 
 (2). This is equal to use the guessed extras/payments 
 from the cointegration equations as a move backwardor in Eq. 
 (2). For the purposes of the present paper, Engle and 
 Granger's two-step method is used. 
 The habit effects deeply set within  Eq. (2) may be referred to as short memory, linear habit (creation and construction/ group of objects), with 
 
 (serving to add something) toughness effects 2 . The term short memory 
 is used because only last period's consumption pattern (i.e. a one-period lag) is allowed to condition current portion decisions. So, in our (creation and construction/ group of objects) (2), 
 it points to/shows that previous distribution of food expenses affects current decisions. This creation is 
 almost the same as that used by Kesavan and Buhr (1995). 
 The guesses of linear evenness, and matching and evenness, are also tested. Based on a Wald 
 test, the maintenance of both evenness, and matching and evenness, cannot be rejected at a 5% 
 importance level. For evenness testing the calculated value of x2 is 5.31 and the similar counted value is 9.49 for 4 degrees of freedom and 5% 
 level of importance, whereas for evenness and 
 matching testing the calculated value of x2 is 17.82 
 and the similar counted value is 18.31 for 
 10 degrees of freedom and 5% level of importance. 
 This hints that the scientific results are at least 
 possibly consistent and valid for this functional 
 (detailed description of exactly what is required). 
 The guessed limits/guidelines reported in Table 2 possess both properties of evenness and matching. 
 The figured out/calculated budget-shares make happy monotonicity 
 and the curviness of the hidden (under) (true) expense function is secured/made sure of by the fact that all own-price 
 Dummiesian elasticities (see Table 4) are negative, and 
 as a result the similar Slutsky matrix is negative semi-definite. Finally, the guessed limits/guidelines 
 of the error correction terms, A.;, are all (related to numbers) 
 significant and have the correct signs, pointing to/showing that 
 mistakes from long-run balance are corrected 
 within the time period. It is also worth noting that 
 the importance of the error correction terms in SUR 
 guesses is agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with the (before that/before now) received/got 
 results of cointegration analysis. 
 The guess of the overall habit (creation and construction/ group of objects) cannot be rejected. Based on Wald test, the calculated 
 value of x2 for testing habits (creation and construction/ group of objects) is 17.07 
 and the similar counted value is 9.49 for 4 
 degrees of freedom and 5% level of importance. 
 Anyway, habits seem to be of low importance in 
 explaining chicken consumption patterns. So, pre- 
 
 At this point we recognized the limited number of (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) 
 for conducting cointegration tests. For this reason, we have used 
 the Engle and Granger's (1987) way(s) of doing things, which provides 
 reliable guesses with a small sample size. 
 
 2 More general forms of habit (creation and construction/ group of objects) are developed by Holt 
 and Goodwin (1997). They thought about/believed the long memory, (not going in a straight line), 
 non-(serving to add something) habit effect as the most general (creation and construction/ group of objects), which 
 may be nested to short memory, linear habit (creation and construction/ group of objects) used in 
 this paper. 
 
 a unit root cannot be rejected at the 10% importance level. When first differences are used, unit 
 root non-stationarity was rejected at the same level 
 of importance. This points to/shows that the levels of all 
 tested (numbers that change/things that change) are non-unmoving, (in other words) 1(1), and so, 
 a standard (related to studying numbers) guessing is validated (Dickey 
 and Fuller, 1981). The next step is to test for cointegration between the (numbers that change/things that change) of Eq. (1) using 
 the Engle and Granger (1987) way(s) of doing things 1 . According to the result reported in the third column 
 of Table 1 all budget-shares are cointegrated with 
 valuable thing prices and real expense at a 10% 
 importance level. Cointegration secures/makes sure of that shocks 
 affecting valuable thing prices or real expenses will 
 be reflected on different expense shares in a almost the same  way showing that these (numbers that change/things that change) are moving 
 together in the long-run and exactly follow (orders) an balance 
 restriction. 
 Having established that all the (numbers that change/things that change) in Eq. (1) 
 are 1(1) process and cointegrated, the guessed ECM 
 form of the AIDS is given as:

 vious years' (relative) expense for chicken does 
 not affect the current meat expense portion 
 decisions and people can (change to make better/change to fit new conditions) chicken 
 consumption to long-run balance much 
 faster than consumption the other meat items. That 
 is, the current chicken consumption (changes to make better/changes to fit new conditions) by 89% 
 to the difference between the previous years' and the 
 long-run consumption levels. This is a result 
 of the low importance of habits in explaining chicken 
 consumption patterns. On the other hand, according to 
 the guessed limits/guidelines reported in Table 2, the rate 
 of change in the budget-share of beef, mutton-lamb, 
 and pork has been (stated that something is much bigger, worse, etc., than it really is) over time. That is, 
 habits caused a faster rate of (act of something getting bigger, wider, etc.) of these meat 
 items' budget-share.

 and expense elasticities between the AIDS and the 
 linearized AIDS as long as calculations are made at 
 the point of (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy)ization. The Marshallian price and

 Guesses of short-run elasticities are received/got by using the above formulas and the guessed limits/guidelines 
 of (2), while their long run partners are measured 
 by using the same formulas and the guessed limits/guidelines of the cointegration equations (Johnson et al., 
 1992). 
 The short-run own-price Marshallian elasticities for 
 all meat items are found to be negative, and so 
 the similar demand and pork curves are downward sloping (see Table 3). Beef was found to have 
 price elastic demand, pork an almost unitary ability to stretch, whereas mutton-lamb, chicken and sausages had 
 inelastic demands. When the long-run own-price Marshallian elasticities are carefully thought about/believed, beef and pork were 
 found to have a demand ability to stretch greater than one, 
 whereas mutton-lamb, chicken and sausages still had 
 inelastic demands. It is interesting to note that the

 two meat items with both short- and long-run inelastic demand (i.e. mutton-Iamb and chicken) showed 
 only (almost nothing/very little) changes in price response between the 
 short and long run. Given that short-run elasticities are 
 smaller than their long-run partners for all meat 
 items, the LeChatelier way of thinking/basic truth/rule holds 3 . 
 The guessed expense elasticities are also reported on Table 3. Beef and chicken were found to 
 have a short-run ability to stretch greater than one, pointing to/showing that these two meat items can be thought about/believed to be 
 expensive things/special privileges. On the other hand, mutton-Iamb, pork, and 
 sausages were found to behave as needs. In the 
 long run, all meat items except sausages, showed 
 almost the same  behavior relating to/connected to expense changes. 
 That is, only sausages tended to change for a necessary 
 good in the short-run to a (expensive thing/rich and comfortable condition) good in the long run. 
 Finally, given the importance of short- and long-run 
 expense elasticities it is clear that the LeChatelier 
 way of thinking/basic truth/rule is also happy relating to/connected to expense 
 elasticities. 
 All meat items are found to be substitutes to each 
 other except chicken and mutton-lamb, and pork and 
 chicken (see Table 4). Sausages however, have, a totally different behavior as it is found to be complement with all other meat items except beef. This result may be explained by the fact that sausages is a 
 meat (something produced along with something else), which is not used for basic nutrition 
 needs, but mainly as an snack good. Unfortunately, 
 there are no previous scientific results in this issue, 
 especially based on (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) from other countries, to 
 provide an different line of comparison. 
 3 The LeChatelier way of thinking/basic truth/rule states that long-run demand fimctions are more price and expense sensitive than their short-run 
 partners. So, at the best, price and expense elasticities are greater in long-rather than short-run (Silberberg, 1992, 
 pp. 216-222). 
 
 Compared with previous findings by Karagiannis 
 et al. (1996), on meat demand in Greece, the guessed own-price Marshallian elasticities in the present 
 study are greater for beef and mutton-lamb and smaller 
 for chicken, pork and sausages. In the same way/in that way, the guessed expense elasticities are greater compared 
 to the findings of Karagiannis et al. (1996), for all 
 the meat items thought about/believed in this study except for 
 mutton-lamb, which are close to each other. These differences may be due to different grouping big plans/layouts/dishonest plans, 
 time periods covered, model (detailed description of exactly what is required) and econometric guess ways of doing things. 
 
 5. Ending/deciding statements 
 This paper represents a energetic (detailed description of exactly what is required) of the 
 AIDS based on recent developments on cointegration 
 ways of doing things and error correction models. The AIDS is 
 (changed to make better/changed to fit new conditions) in the same way/in that way to give rise to an AIDS-ECM. 
 Based on the Greek meat consumption data over the 
 period 1958-1993, it was found that the proposed 
 creation (does as expected) well in both possible and 
 (related to studying numbers) grounds. Especially, the possible properties of evenness and matching are supported 
 by the data and so the received/got ability to stretch guesses 
 are valid and correct for policy issues analysis. This 
 hints that more attention should be paid to the 
 (related to studying numbers) properties of the data before a particular 
 (detailed description of exactly what is required) of the expense share equation is 
 chosen. 
 The proposed model has also the ability to provide 
 guesses of both short- and long-run demand elasticities, a feature that significantly enlarges the other choices for policy tests. Given that in the case of 
 meat consumption in Greece, short- and long-run demand elasticities have great differences to each other 
 (except for chicken) price or income changes is expected to affect quite differently people behavior. 
 For chicken, however, the difference between shortand long-run price elasticities is very small (see Table 3) and given the low importance of habits (creation and construction/ group of objects), it is expected that will not be any a big difference between people reaction to price 
 changes in the short- and long-run. In contrast, this is 
 not the case for the other meat items thought about/believed in this 
 study.
