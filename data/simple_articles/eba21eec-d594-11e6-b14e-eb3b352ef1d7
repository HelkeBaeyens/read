 1. Introduction 
 
 The continuous creation/introduction of new 
 technology has been used as a standard for distinguishing a modem farming-based system from a traditional system (Schultz, 1964). However, in developing countries, some new farming-based technologies 
 have been only partially successful in improving 
 productive (wasting very little while working or producing something). This is often attributed to a 
 lack of ability and/ or desire to (change to make better/change to fit new conditions) input 
 levels on the part of producers, due to (state of knowing someone or something well) 
 with traditional farming-based systems (i.e., Schultz's 
 'poor but (producing a lot with very little waste)' guess) andI or the presence 
 of institutional and cultural restrictions (Ghatak and 
 lngerset, 1984). These (things to carefully think about) suggest that, in 
 some cases, there may exist a negative relationship 
 between technical progress in ordinary farming and (understood/made real/achieved) (wasting very little while working or producing something) gains.

 This paper examines (wasting very little while working or producing something) for combination rice in 
 China. Rice is a very important crop in Chinese 
 farming. Since 1976, F1 blended varieties 1 have 
 become more and more important in Chinese rice production, relative to 'conventional' rice varieties, 
 which are mostly improved semi-dwarf varieties. 2 In 1990, about 40% of China's rice 
 was planted in combination rice (Lin, 1994). While combination 
 
 1 F combinations are a type of high cooperating with/producing/giving up variety of rice. The 
 1 
 production of F 1 combination seed involves a complicated three-line 
 method (Lin, l99la). First, a cytoplasmic male-(having no germs/unable to have children) parent plant 
 is located. This plant is then crossed with a maintainer line to 
 produce children/child that, while (having no germs/unable to have children), have desirable (related to tiny chemical assembly instructions inside of living things) (features/ qualities/ traits). These seeds are then crossed with a 'restorer' line to 
 produce F 1 seeds with (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) self-fertilizing abilities. 
 2 Strictly speaking, ordinary rice varieties now being 
 used in China are not traditional in the Schultz sense but are 
 instead post 'green revolution' varieties. Therefore, the newer 
 combination rice vruieties are 'third generation' varieties.

 rice has been introduced to some other rice producing countries, China is the only country in the world 
 in which combination rice is widely used in commercial 
 production. 
 The Chinese government often influences the diffusion of new farming-based technologies according to 
 its independence goal. As a result, the importance of (wasting very little while working or producing something) (things to carefully think about) in the adoption 
 decision (related to/looking at/thinking about) combination rice at the (related to a large area) and 
 producer level is uncertain. The measurement of 
 technical and money-based (wasting very little while working or producing something) for combination rice 
 production, and the relationship of (wasting very little while working or producing something) and 
 producer (how money affects people's lives) (features/ qualities/ traits) would be 
 useful in facing these issues. While other studies 
 have examined money-based issues related to the adoption and production of combination rice (e.g., He et al., 
 1984, 1987; Lin, 1991a,b, 1992, 1994), little attention has been given to the examination of (wasting very little while working or producing something) 
 for combination rice production in China. 
 Most studies that examine (wasting very little while working or producing something) in developing country farming have focused on technical 
 (wasting very little while working or producing something) (Bravo-Ureta and Pinheiro, 1993). While 
 physical working well (things to carefully think about) are important, 
 improvements in money-based (wasting very little while working or producing something) will lead to 
 greater benefits to farming-based producers in these 
 countries. Previous studies have examined (wasting very little while working or producing something) 
 in rice production for other developing countries 
 (e.g., Dawson et al., 1991; Kalirajan, 1991). However, few studies have examined the effects of technical change on (wasting very little while working or producing something). 
 The first (or most important) purpose of this paper is to examine 
 the effects of technical change on (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) of 
 traditional and modem farming within the big picture 
 of rice production in China, (in other words), to provide a test of 
 Schultz's 'poor but (producing a lot with very little waste)' guess. In doing 
 so, both technical and money-based (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) are 
 carefully thought about/believed within the big picture  of technical change 
 (i.e., adoption of combination rice). A secondary goal 
 is to examine the linkage between (wasting very little while working or producing something) in rice 
 production and producer (how money affects people's lives) (features/ qualities/ traits) in order to provide information that may be 
 useful in analysing the effects of policies designed to 
 improve the working well of new farming-based technologies. 
 These goals are (accomplished or gained) through an examination of productive (wasting very little while working or producing something) for ordinary and 
 combination rice in China. Two edge of something/unexplored area production functions are guessed; one for ordinary rice and 
 
 one for combination rice. These functions are then used to 
 measure the degree of (wasting very little while working or producing something) for Chinese rice 
 production. 
 The rest of this paper is organized as follows. A brief review of edge of something/unexplored area production function 
 way(s) of doing things is given in Section 2. This is followed by a discussion of the (related to careful studying or deep thinking) model used 
 in the study, and a description of the study areas 
 and data. The results of the analysis are then presented and discussed. Section 6 summarizes the 
 study's findings and provides some ending/deciding comments. 
 
 2. (wasting very little while working or producing something) and edge of something/unexplored area production functions 
 Farrell (1957) tells the difference between technical and 
 allocative (wasting very little while working or producing something) (or price (wasting very little while working or producing something)) in production through the use of a 'frontier' production function. Technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) is the ability to produce a 
 given level of output with a minimum amount of 
 inputs under certain technology. Allocative (wasting very little while working or producing something) refers to the ability of choosing best input 
 levels for given factor prices. Money-based or total 
 (wasting very little while working or producing something) is the product of technical and allocative 
 (wasting very little while working or producing something). An (money-based)/cheaply (producing a lot with very little waste) input-output 
 combination would be on both the edge of something/unexplored area function 
 and the (act of something getting bigger, wider, etc.) path. 
 Scientific studies of productive (wasting very little while working or producing something) have 
 used a variety of approaches in modelling edge of something/unexplored area 
 production functions; parametric vs. nonparametric, 
 pre-decided vs. (random/including random data points), and programming methods vs. (related to studying numbers) methods. Battese (1992) provides a 
 review of parametric (wasting very little while working or producing something) methods, both pre-decided and (random/including random data points). Bravo-Ureta and Pinheiro 
 (1993) provide a review of scientific studies relating 
 to farm level production (wasting very little while working or producing something) in developing 
 countries. 
 Given the other choice scientific tools available, the 
 choice as to the 'best' method is unclear. Little 
 difficult/strict/high quality analysis has been done in testing the 
 sensitivity of (wasting very little while working or producing something) measures to the choice of 
 way(s) of doing things. Bravo-Ureta and Rieger (1990) compare the results of pre-decided (both programming 
 and econometric analyses) and (random/including random data points) parametric 
 (wasting very little while working or producing something) models for a sample of US dairy farms. 
 While the guesses from each approach differ (numbers-based), the ordinal (wasting very little while working or producing something) rankings of farms 
 
 X. Xu, S.R. Jeffrey/ Farming-based Money flow 18 ( 1998) 157-165 
 
 received/got from the different models appear to be quite 
 almost the same. This would suggest that, to a certain degree, 
 the choice between other choice modelling approaches 
 may be somewhat random. 
 
 3. (related to careful studying or deep thinking) model and scientific methods 
 This study employs a (random/including random data points) parametric rotting and neoclassical (two things existing together) model to measure the technical, allocative and money-based (wasting very little while working or producing something) of combination and ordinary rice production in 
 China. The (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area production function 
 model is specified as follows: 
 
 ( 1) 
 where Y is output (i.e., yieldjha), x. represents the 
 actual input vector (i.e., input usejha), fJ is the 
 vector of production function limits/guidelines, v is a 
 random error term with zero mean and u is a nonnegative one-sided error term. 
 The edge of something/unexplored area production function is represented by 
 f(X.,fJ), and is a measure of greatest potential 
 output for any particular input vector x -. Both v and 
 u cause actual production to move away from this edge of something/unexplored area. The random (quality of changing over time or at different places) in production that cannot 
 be influenced by producers is represented by v (e.g., 
 (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) factors such as temperature and moisture); it is identically and independently distributed 
 as N(O, a}) and may be thought about/believed as the 'normal' 
 error term. The non-negative error term u represents 
 mistakes from greatest potential output (named after/discovered by/caused by) technical inefficiency; u is identically 
 and independently distributed 'half (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy)' (i.e., 
 IN(O, a-})1). 3 
 The use of (random/including random data points), parametric way(s) of doing things is 
 agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with recent farming-based production (wasting very little while working or producing something) studies (e.g., Bravo-Ureta and Evenson, 1994; 
 Kumbhakar, 1994; Parikh and Shah, 1994). There 
 are also some idea-based advantages to using a 
 
 3 (not very long ago), the question of the most appropriate distribution for 
 the compound error term has (risen up/become visible) (Bravo-Ureta and Pinheiro, 
 1993). While more flexible distributional ideas (you think are true) may be 
 made for u (e.g., Greene, 1990), there is no difficult/strict/high quality (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) that 
 these improve results. Also, most scientific (random/including random data points) production function studies use the half-(usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) distribution. 
 
 159 
 
 (random/including random data points) approach, as it allows for (related to studying numbers) noise 
 rather than attributing all mistakes to (wasting very little while working or producing something) 
 differences. Finally, this approach is (compared to other things) 
 plain/honest/easy to put into use and understand/explain. 
 A Cobb-Douglas functional form is employed to 
 model rice production technology in this study. While 
 more flexible functional forms than the CobbDouglas may be chosen for modelling edge of something/unexplored area farming-based production technology (e.g., the translog used 
 by Kumbhakar, 1994), Kopp and Smith (1980) suggest that functional form has a limited effect on 
 scientific (wasting very little while working or producing something) measurement. The CobbDouglas form has been used in many scientific 
 studies, especially those relating to developing 
 country farming. 4 The Cobb-Douglas functional 
 form also meets the needed thing of being self-dual, 
 allowing an examination of money-based (wasting very little while working or producing something). 
 The edge of something/unexplored area production function model is guessed using Maximum Chance procedures. In 
 order to scientifically measure technical (wasting very little while working or producing something), the 
 mistakes from the edge of something/unexplored area must be separated into a 
 random part (i.e., v) and an inefficiency part (i.e., u). Given the distributional ideas (you think are true) 
 for u and v, the Maximum Chance guess 
 provides (good) enough information to calculate a (may or may not happen, depending on something) mean for u (Jondrow et al., 1982). From this 
 calculation, guesses of u and v may be serious and stubborn. 
 Technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) is scientifically measured using (changed to make better/changed to fit new conditions) output (Y *) for each firm. (changed to make better/changed to fit new conditions) 
 output represents the watched/followed output (Y) (changed to make better/changed to fit new conditions) 
 for (related to studying numbers) noise, and is calculated as follows: 
 
 Y * = f( x.;fJ)- u = Y- v 
 
 (2) 
 
 where x. represents actual input use, j() is the 
 'deterministic' edge of something/unexplored area output, and u and v are 
 guesses of the random and inefficiency parts/pieces 
 of overall mistakes from the edge of something/unexplored area. 
 Fig. 1 illustrates the difference between watched/followed 
 and (changed to make better/changed to fit new conditions) output. For firm i, Xi is the vector of 
 actual input use and Yi is the watched/followed output. Given 
 the level of input use, the edge of something/unexplored area output is represented by A. This is greater than the pre-decided 
 edge of something/unexplored area output (i.e., B = f(Xi; fJ)) due to good/willing 
 
 4 The review by Battese ( 1992) of edge of something/unexplored area production functions 
 provides an indication of the frequency with which Cobb-Douglas technology is assumed in these studies.

 The technically (producing a lot with very little waste), (money-based)/cheaply (producing a lot with very little waste) 
 and actual input vectors (XI' Xe and Xa, (match up each pair of items in order)) may be combined with the input price vector 
 P to figure out/calculate  technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) (TE), money-based 
 (wasting very little while working or producing something) (EE) and allocative (wasting very little while working or producing something) (AE) indices, as follows: 
 TE = ( x;P)j( X&#126;P)

 conditions (i.&#126;e., vi&amp;gt; 0). The total moving away from the 
 edge of something/unexplored area function for this firm, as defined by Eq. (1) 
 (i.e., u - u) is the distance BY;. This distance may 
 be separated into the random part (i.e., u = 
 AB) and the inefficiency part (i.e., u = AY) 
 using the method developed by Jondrow et al. (1982). 
 As pointed to/showed by Eq. (2), u; (i.e., distance A Y) is 
 subtracted from the pre-decided edge of something/unexplored area output to 
 get the (changed to make better/changed to fit new conditions) output for firm i (Y; * ). (in almost the same way), 
 firm j uses inputs Xj to produce lj. Edge of something/unexplored area output 
 for this firm is C. The total moving away from the 
 pre-decided edge of something/unexplored area function (i.e., DY) may be 
 separated into the random part CD (i.e., 
 u &amp;lt; 0) and the inefficiency part CYr (changed to make better/changed to fit new conditions) 
 output 1j * is equal to the pre-decided edge of something/unexplored area 
 output minus uj (i.e., D- CYj). 
 (changed to make better/changed to fit new conditions) output ( Y * ) is used to calculate the 
 technical (producing a lot with very little waste) input vector (X1). X 1 is received/made from 
 by (at the same time) solving Eq. (1) and the input 
 ratios X 1 /X; = k; (i &amp;gt; 1) where k; is equal to the 
 watched/followed ratio of the two inputs (i.e., from Xa) in 
 the production of Y *. Battese (1992) provides a 
 described/explained explanation of (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area production 
 function way(s) of doing things and the calculation of X 1- 
 Given the idea (you think is true) of Cobb-Douglas technology, the edge of something/unexplored area production function is self-dual. 
 So, the similar cost edge of something/unexplored area can be received/made from 
 (in a way when you carefully examine something) from the (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area production 
 function guess. Shephard's lemma is used to decide/figure out the set of (may or may not happen, depending on something) factor demand functions. These functions provide the (money-based)/cheaply (producing a lot with very little waste) levels of input use (Xe), given a particular 
 output level and set of input prices. Since the cost 
 
 where x;P is the technically (producing a lot with very little waste) cost of production, X&#126;P is the (money-based)/cheaply (producing a lot with very little waste) cost of 
 production, and X&#126;P is the actual cost of production 
 for any particular firm's watched/followed level of output. In 
 all cases, (producing a lot with very little waste) production is represented by an 
 index value of 1.0, and lower index values represent 
 less (producing a lot with very little waste) production (i.e., a greater degree of 
 inefficiency). 
 
 4. Sample areas and study data 
 The data used in this study are received/got from a 
 thin sliceal survey of families in Jiangsu 
 area of control/area of land in China. The survey was carried out from 
 July 1985 to January 1986. Jiangsu area of control/area of land is located in the Yangtze River valley and is one of the 
 most important rice producing areas in China, as the 
 area's climate is well suited for rice production. In 
 1986, the average rice yield in this area of control/area of land was 
 6.76 metric tonjha, or 1.56 metric ton more than the 
 national average. The area spread around to rice and total rice 
 output of the area of control/area of land, in 1986, represented 7.8 and 
 9.8%, (match up each pair of items in order), of the totals for China. 
 Jiangsu area of control/area of land can be divided into three rice 
 production areas: north (i.e., north of the Yangtze 
 River valley), central (i.e., along the Yangtze River 
 valley) and south (i.e., south of the Yangtze River 
 valley). While natural farming-based production conditions are almost the same  among these three areas, money-based development has been rather unbalanced. In 
 the south, the (process of people making, selling, and buying things) is (compared to other things) well developed. 
 Poor people' once-a-year income is about two times

 greater in the south than in the north. As shown in 
 Table 1, poor people in the south are better educated 
 than those in the north and central areas. Due to 
 the greater development of non-farm (away from cities) industry 
 in the south, farmers in this area also have much more off-farm income than those in the north 
 and the central areas (Table 1). 
 A big differences also exist among the three 
 areas in terms of relative input use in rice production. As shown in Table 1, the use of capital inputs is 
 highest in the south area (i.e., 29% greater than in 
 the north) and lowest in the north, while labour use 
 on a per hectare basis is lowest in the south (i.e., 
 17% lower than in the north) and greatest in the 
 north. Given these differences in the (features/ qualities/ traits) 
 of farming between the three rice production areas of Jiangsu area of control/area of land, the north is defined as a 
 traditional farming-based area while the central and 
 the south are classified as more modern farming-based 
 areas, for the purposes of this study. 
 In beginning and building on the sample for the farm household 
 survey, two counties are selected from each area 
 (i.e., south, central and north) on a random basis. 
 The six counties selected from this process are Wu, 
 jing and Jurong (south); Taixing and Jiandu (central), 
 and Huaiyin and Dafeny (north). Within each of 
 these counties, 15 ordinary rice farmers and 15 
 combination rice farmers are randomly selected as the 
 sample families for the survey. This results in a 
 total sample size of 180 rice families, distributed 
 over 33 villages in the six counties. 
 Each of these 180 families is surveyed with 
 respect to output levels and input use in rice production, as well as (how money affects people's lives) (features/ qualities/ traits). Rice 
 
 production and input data are collected on a per 
 hectare basis. Rice yield is expressed in terms of 
 metric tonjha. Data are collected for five productive 
 inputs; labour, chemical (material that makes plants grow better), manurial (material that makes plants grow better), 
 machinery and crop-watering/rinsing with water services, and bug-killers. 
 Labour use is expressed as day jha, with 1 day being 
 equal to 8 h of labour. Chemical (material that makes plants grow better) use is 
 measured as metric tons of total/totally/with nothing else mixed in nutrient per hectare, 
 while manurial (material that makes plants grow better) use is measured in value 
 terms, grouped by the local price. Machinery and 
 crop-watering/rinsing with water services are grouped using tractor service time. Bug-killers are measured in terms of kgjha. 
 In addition to input and output amounts, prices for 
 input and output are collected on a (related to a large area) average 
 basis. 
 (how money affects people's lives) (features/ qualities/ traits) are also collected 
 for the survey sample. These (features/ qualities/ traits) include 
 household size, total number of years of education 
 for household labour, average income from non-rice 
 farm sources, average non-farm income and total 
 area of rice production. These data are used in the 
 analysis to identify important (features/ qualities/ traits) influencing (wasting very little while working or producing something) of rice production. 
 5. Scientific rtrsults 
 
 Cross-sectional data for a sample of 90 combination 
 rice (HR) families and 90 ordinary rice (CR) 
 families are used to guess 'average' and edge of something/unexplored area rice production functions. 5 The sample size for 
 5 The average functions are guessed using OLS procedures 
 and represent the results received/got from 'standard' production 
 function analysis. 
 
 X. Xu, S.R. Jeffrey/ Farming-based Money flow 18 (1998) 157-165

 the CR production function is 100, since some HR 
 families are included in both samples (i.e., produce both combination and ordinary rice). Dummies 
 are included in the model to represent the south 
 (D 1 = 1) and central (D 2 = 1) areas. Table 2 presents the maximum chance guesses of (random/including random data points) 
 edges of something/unexplored areas for HR and CR. Standard OLS guesses 
 (i.e., the average functions) are given for comparison. 
 Some effects/results/suggestions may be drawn from the results 
 shown in Table 2. First, the constant term for the CR 
 function is higher than that for the HR function 
 (5.944 vs. 4.895). This lends believability to the view 
 that since CR varieties have been changed over time 
 for use in poor conditions with (compared to other things) low capital 
 input use, they have a higher 'basic' yield (Hayami 
 and Ruttan, 1985). Also, the (related to a large area) yield differences (taken/took by force)/(taken/took control of) by the dummy (numbers that change/things that change) (D 1 and D 2 ) 
 are much greater for HR production than for CR 
 production, especially for the south area. 
 The results in Table 2 also suggest that the response in HR production is much more elastic with 
 respect to chemical (material that makes plants grow better) and bug-killers than is 
 the case for CR production. This is also true to a 
 lesser extent for manurial (material that makes plants grow better) and machinery 
 services. The opposite is true for labour input use, 
 however. These results confirm the findings by Fan 
 (1991) that 'modem' inputs (e.g., chemical (material that makes plants grow better)s 
 
 and machinery services) are becoming more important for Chinese farming over time, (in other words), with the 
 increase in combination rice production. Overall, HR production is more (able to reply or react/quick to respond) to scale increases in the 
 five inputs modelled in the analysis, (in other words), the ability to stretch "of scale for the HR function is 0.804 vs. 0.387 for 
 CR production. 
 The HR and CR edge of something/unexplored area functions are used, in 
 combination with (related to a large area) average input prices, to 
 get the edge of something/unexplored area cost functions. The resulting cost 
 edges of something/unexplored areas are as follows:

 cost (Yanjday); PcF and PMF are the unit costs of 
 chemical and manurial (material that makes plants grow better), (match up each pair of items in order); PMs 
 is the of the price of machinery service, measured as 
 the cost of renting tractor services; Pps is the price 
 of bug-killers, weighted by the actual use of different 
 bug-killers. 
 Using the cost edges of something/unexplored areas, (related to a large area) average prices 
 and Eq. (3), the money-based (EE), technical (TE) and 
 allocative (AE) (wasting very little while working or producing something) indices are figured out/calculated for 
 each producer. The resulting indices are summarized 
 in Table 3. 
 One result that may be drawn from Table 3 is that 
 (wasting very little while working or producing something) for HR production is lower than for CR 
 production. This is the same across areas, and for 
 all three measures of productive (wasting very little while working or producing something). The relative (i.e., percentage) difference in allocative (wasting very little while working or producing something) is greater than for technical (wasting very little while working or producing something). Not 
 surprisingly, the greatest difference is in money-based

 (wasting very little while working or producing something), since money-based (wasting very little while working or producing something) is calculated as 
 the product of technical and allocative (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste). 
 The degree of (quality of changing over time or at different places) in (wasting very little while working or producing something) is also greater 
 for HR production than for CR production, as measured by the standard moving away. This (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) provides support, in the big picture  of Chinese farming, 
 to the explanation about (wasting very little while working or producing something) and technical progress 
 in traditional farming, and supports the 'poor but 
 (producing a lot with very little waste)' guess, (in other words), farmers are allocatively 
 (producing a lot with very little waste) with traditional varieties. 
 The other significant result that may be drawn 
 from Table 3 is that productive (wasting very little while working or producing something) is greater 
 in the south than in the north. (wasting very little while working or producing something) values for 
 the central area lie between those for the north and 
 south. This difference is consistent for both HR and 
 CR production, and for all three measures of productive (wasting very little while working or producing something). However, the watched/followed differences 
 are greater, on average, for HR production than for 
 CR production. 
 Relative to previous studies for other rice producing areas, Chinese rice production appears to display greater technical (wasting very little while working or producing something). For example, average technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) guesses for rice production 
 in the Philippines and Malaysia are 0.50 (Kalirajan 
 and Flinn, 1983) and 0.65 (Kalirajan and Shand, 
 1986), (match up each pair of items in order). These differences are not surprising, as production decisions in China during the 
 (connected/related) time period (i.e., mid-1980's) were mostly 
 controlled by local government, and a goal of the 
 Chinese government at that time was to (make as big as possible) 
 rice yield. Comparisons for allocative and money-based 
 (wasting very little while working or producing something) are not made, as few studies 
 examine these parts of productive (wasting very little while working or producing something). 
 The (wasting very little while working or producing something) calculations show/tell about a big differences among areas and poor people in HR production. Schumpterian explanation of money-based development 
 hints that technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) is influenced by 
 technical knowledge and understanding, as well as 
 by the (how money affects people's lives) (surrounding conditions) within which the 
 farmer must make decisions (Kalirajan, 1990). Based 
 on previous studies (Bravo-Ureta and Pinheiro, 
 1993 ), three (features/ qualities/ traits) are chosen as indicators 
 of this (how money affects people's lives) (surrounding conditions) and are (after that) used as explanatory (numbers that change/things that change) in the analysis 
 of productive (wasting very little while working or producing something) for HR production: (i) education, measured by average years of education for 
 household labour; (ii) land size, measured by the 
 total land area helped grow; and (iii) total household

 non-farming-based income. OLS procedures are used to 
 guess the relationship between productive (wasting very little while working or producing something) and these (features/ qualities/ traits). 
 The hidden (under) idea (you think is true) in this type of procedure is that the explanatory (numbers that change/things that change) are (coming from the outside of something) 
 to the decisions made by producers. While this is 
 likely true for land size and education, it is not 
 (usually/ in a common and regular way) the case for non-farm income. 6 Given the 
 differences between areas in terms of off-farm 
 employment opportunities, however, it may be argued that to a certain extent non-farm income is 
 (coming from the outside of something). Also, Kalirajan (1991) argues that 
 since (numbers that change/things that change) such as farm size, education and 
 non-farm income have indirect influences on technical (wasting very little while working or producing something), it is appropriate to include these in a 
 secondary analysis. 
 The results of this analysis are presented in Table 
 4. Overall, the explanatory ability of the three (numbers that change/things that change) included in the analysis is limited (i.e., R 2 
 values are usually less than 0.5), and not all (moving backwards) or limit/guideline guesses are significant. Education appears to be a significant factor in explaining 
 technical (wasting very little while working or producing something), but not as significant for allocative (wasting very little while working or producing something). A positive relationship appears to 
 exist between land size, and money-based and allocative 
 (wasting very little while working or producing something) in modern farming-based areas (i.e., the 
 south), while the opposite is true for traditional

 farming-based areas (i.e., the north). This hints that 
 the mostly small farm sizes may present/ask/stand in a showy and fake way a 
 restriction to technical change in more modern areas, but not in more traditional farming-based production areas. A almost the same  analysis was conducted for CR 
 production, but no significant relationships were 
 found. 
 
 6. Ending/deciding comments and policy hint/result/effect 
 This paper uses a (random/including random data points) production and cost 
 edge of something/unexplored area to get technical, allocative and money-based 
 (wasting very little while working or producing something) of Chinese ordinary rice and combination 
 rice production. The results suggest that while HR 
 production increases the potential (making a lot of an item so each item costs less) 
 for Chinese rice production, watched/followed productive 
 (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) are lower than for CR production. The 
 results of this study are agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with 'poor but 
 (producing a lot with very little waste)' guess; poor people are (producing more with less waste) in 
 setting apart inputs for CR production than for HR 
 production. This is consistent for both modern and 
 traditional farming-based areas. 
 Facing increasing population pressures, China has 
 put into use policies designed to improve technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) and total working well. This study shows/tells about a 
 positive relationship between (wasting very little while working or producing something) and education for HR production, this way, focusing on the importance of (thinking about/when one thinks about) poor people' abilities to receive and 
 understand information relating to new farming-based 
 technology. This study also decides/figures out that land size 
 
 X. Xu, S.R. Jeffrey/ Farming-based Money flow 18 (1998) 157-165 
 
 is a positive factor in explaining the (wasting very little while working or producing something) of HR 
 in modern farming-based areas. This hints that in 
 modern farming-based areas, the mostly small 
 farm size may present/ask/stand in a showy and fake way a self-control/control device to technical change 
 and so, supports the argument for further (easing government rules) in land markets.
