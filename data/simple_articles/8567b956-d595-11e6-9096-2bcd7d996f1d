 Abstract 
 This paper describes an econometric test of wine market prices for 21 of the Crus Classes housex in the Bordeaux 
 area of France. The model developed in the analysis tries to define the relationship between factors that influence wine 
 quality and those that influence wine prices. (features/ qualities/ traits) of the models are: (1) climate influences on grape composition 
 (acid and sugar levels), (2) grape (work of art/artistic combining of elements) influences on market prices, (3) (not definite) quality tests (Parker-points) 
 on market prices, and (4) the effects of age of the wine on market prices. 
 The results point to/show that composition levels ofMerlot-ruled wines are more climate sensitive than those from Cabernet 
 Sauvignon-ruled wines. Overall, warm, dry summers result in high sugar and low acid levels at harvest which in turn 
 lead to higher quality wines. 
 Wine market price sensitivity to Parker-point ratings points to/shows that properties with high Cabernet Sauvignon-ruled 
 wines are highly dependent on the external ratings while Merlot-ruled wines have a decreased rating sensitivity. Smaller 
 properties tend to gain over (fair in amount, related to something else/properly sized compared to something else)ly from high ratings pointing to/showing great jumps in price from year to year. Also, 
 housex that have experienced high ratings for past wines show great sensitivity to point steps in ratings for current 
 wines. 
 (old/allowing to get old/getting older) has a positive effect on Bordeaux wine pricing. This is due to the increasing maturity as well as the increasing 
 total (not enough of something). Total lack of product is expressed by the size of the property, with small properties producing less 
 per old/original and therefore having less in the market. Also, Merlot-dorninated wines show more maturing potential 
 and profit more from (old/allowing to get old/getting older) than Cabernet Sauvignon-ruled wines. 
 Average per house real once-a-year (money made/good thing received) ranges from 1 to 10%. High levels of grape ripeness, total (not enough of something), and smaller 
 properties that are ruled by Merlot in their blend lead to the highest (money made/good things received). Forecasts for a old/original not yet available to buy 
 points to/shows that 1995 is better than 1994 for both Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot-ruled wines, but that 1996 and 1997 are 
 not as good as 1995, especially for Merlot-ruled wines.Â© 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

 wines sometimes (accomplish or gain with effort) in sales. Since many 
 of the famous red wines like Housex Margaux, 
 Mouton-Rothschild, Lafite-Rothschild or Petrus, 
 which the average wine person has probably not 
 experienced, but certainly heard of - this happens 
 especially to Bordeaux wines. The interest of professional (people or businesss who give money to help start businesses) in Bordeaux wines has increased 
 very much in the last twenty years because the (money made/good thing received) 
 cooperated with/produced/gave up per year can be huge/extreme. According to a 
 ranking of the best investment-wines of 1996, yields 
 of 500% and more are regularly (accomplished or gained) (Bllittel 
 and Stainless, 1997). Therefore, the money-based books has begun to examine this theme with the goal 
 to recommend appropriate investment plans and 
 (mixes of stocks, bonds, etc./document collections) (i.e., Schubert, 1996). In general, these 
 recommendations are based on experiences of the 
 (possibility of/possible happening of)  the development of certain wines and on 
 knowledge of the product. Even with this increasing interest in wine investment, scientific studies 
 on wine pricing are still rare. This lack of money-based 
 test is in fact amazing, first, because of the 
 wide spread variance of the prices of single housex, 
 and secondly, in respect to the variance within single 
 wines. For example a bottle of House Cheval 
 Blanc from the 1972 old/original is available for less 
 than 20US-$, while the 1982 old/original from the same 
 house costs about 500US-$. 
 Two of the rare scientific (acts of asking questions and trying to find the truth about something) on this topic 
 are those of Combris et al. (1997) and Palefelter 
 et al. (1995). After guessing a (related to feeling pleasure) price function 
 for many Bordeaux wines, Combris et al. (1997) come 
 to the end/end result that wine prices are rarely caused 
 by organoleptic (sensory) (features/ qualities/ traits). Although it 
 is true that experts, through many tastings, can build 
 a complex quality profile for individual housex or 
 wines, the information is not overly useful for the 
 average person since they would not want to repeat 
 this procedure. Given that the average person only 
 has general and sometimes (not totally pure/not totally correct) information on 
 quality, label fame seems to be much more important. Since Combris et al. (1997) (examined closely) only 
 young wines of all quality levels it is hard to apply 
 these results to top Bordeaux wines due to the huge price variances of different wines. 
 This scientific shortage is healed/made better by the econometric approach of Palefelter et al. (1995). The 
 authors developed a panel equation, termed the 
 "Bordeaux-equation", which defines the influence of 
 
 (old/allowing to get old/getting older) and different weather (features/ qualities/ traits) on a generalized Bordeaux index. Beside the test of 
 particular (things that decide other things), this approach also provides a 
 relative (statement about the future) of prices for wines which are not 
 yet available to buy but have been sold as futures. It is 
 obvious that the generalized Bordeaux-equation, as 
 an average index, cannot explain the price of a single 
 housex' wines with the necessary (quality of being done perfectly or being totally correct) needed 
 in an investment. This problem could be solved in 
 general by guessing not a area-wide average index 
 but single equations for each house. On one hand 
 this approach could easily be put into use to help explain 
 and forecast prices of single house wines. On the 
 other hand, the blend of each house cannot be neglected since the top wines of Bordeaux are cuvees 
 made from different varieties that are expected to 
 react in a different way to (related to the Earth's weather) factors. Therefore, 
 it is probable that the quality and prices could also 
 be different according to the particular blend. This 
 should be taken into account allowing the "goal 
 quality" of the single varieties to be guessed separately. However, according to Combris et al. (1997), 
 the hit/effect of the wine quality on the price is not forcing/interesting since the quality information is not available 
 or obvious to the average person. This information 
 shortage has been healed/made better by the development of many (not definite) quality point systems and rankings 
 in the (made to do one thing very well) books (e.g., Broadbent, 1981; 
 Writing-Roswell, 1989; Parker, 1985). Since the (related to feeling pleasure) approach assumes that most wine people 
 think about/believe these rankings in their buying decisions, 
 their including in something in an money-based model is warranted. 
 In the same way/in that way, the following paper introduces a recursive econometric multi-equation model on Bordeaux 
 wine pricing. First, the model numbers the dependence of Crus Classes prices on (related to the Earth's weather) influences, 
 grape (work of art/artistic combining of elements), Parker-points, and (old/allowing to get old/getting older). Second, 
 the model allows one to forecast wine prices in order 
 to compare (able to be done) market prices and actual future prices. In the first section the general structure of 
 the model and the information file used to construct it is explained. Next, the (related to the Earth's weather) influences on wine (work of art/artistic combining of elements) are described for the Bordeaux area. Then the 
 recursive model blocks "composition" and "price" and 
 the similar equation (detailed descriptions of exactly what is required) from which 
 the (ability to change) of a (happening together) solution is shown. 
 The final section presents model tests and sensitivity results.

 a Data from Bliittel and Stainless (1997). A value of zero means the wine was not available at sale. 
 
 2. Data and methods 
 One of the more typical features of great Bordeaux 
 wines is their amazing long life. It is through 
 maturity, (accomplished or gained) during long storage, that most 
 Bordeaux wines develop their typical character. Many 
 wines have (how long people are expected to live) of at least 20 years and 
 have been known to remain doable/possible for over a century. Together, the long life and the high (money made/good thing received) yield 
 expectancy, make Bordeaux wines not only a consumption good in great demand but also a desirable 
 international based on guessing/guessed good. Because of this, the wines of 
 many of the housex from Bordeaux (many other top 
 wines from other areas are represented as well) are 
 traded all over the world in established wine sales. 
 This system (promises that something will definitely happen or that something will definitely work as described), almost the same as  a stock market, 
 a (compared to something else) high price clearness/open honesty. Therefore, 
 it can be assumed that sale prices point to/show the 
 relative (money-based) (not enough of something) and therefore the international respect for those wines. For this analysis, 
 the price information file refers to all (connected/related) wine sales 
 held worldwide within 1996/1997 and is calculated as 
 
 the weighted math average of all auction prices 
 of one wine. 1 To get a complete set of data, 
 only often traded wines are carefully thought about/believed in this 
 analysis. Therefore, the current (act of asking questions and trying to find the truth about something) is restricted to the wines 1980-1994 and to 21 housex 
 (Table 1 gives the price data set used in the analysis). The model is understood/created as a total/totally/with nothing else mixed in panel model 
 (cross-sectional model) which tries to explain 
 the wine prices of different housex and wines. 
 All equations are specified linearly, logarithmically 
 or semi-logarithmically, and are guessed with the 
 ordinary least square (OLS) way of doing things. The model is 
 recursive and consists of two sections: a composition 
 and climate section and a price section. 
 First it is assumed that (related to the Earth's weather) (numbers that change/things that change) such as 
 (rain, snow, etc.), sun exposure or temperature decide/figure out particular quality features of the grapes- the (combination of different substances, objects, people, etc.) of the raw material. Here, the model distinguishes 
 between the two main varieties grown in Bordeaux:

 Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot (which account for 
 over 80% of grapes grown in the area) and explains 
 their clearly stated/particular sugar and acid content at harvest (four 
 separate equations). These endogenously serious and stubborn 
 (numbers that change/things that change) are then used as explanatory (numbers that change/things that change) in the 
 price section of the model, which (in the end) consists 
 of21 equations, (i.e., one for every house in the analysis). According to the average blend of the particular house, the (detailed description of exactly what is required) of the equation involves 
 more Cabernet Sauvignon or more Merlot compositional features. In addition to these (coming from the outside of something) wine 
 quality (numbers that change/things that change), (numbers that change/things that change) for the best known international quality rankings for each house, the (what people commonly call a/not really a) 
 Parker-points (Parker, 1985), and the relative ages of 
 the particular wines are included in the equations. The 
 complete structure of the model is given in Fig. 1. 
 
 2.1. Climate, phenology, and composition 
 effects on quality 
 Grapevines are a (related to where mountains, rivers, cities, etc., are located) emotional crop, 
 being grown in clear/separate climate governments worldwide 
 that provide the ideal situations to produce high quality grapes. This is nowhere more obvious than in 
 Bordeaux, a area that is sounding the same as/equal to some 
 of the best wines in the world. While the interactions between the local climate, soil, and site location 
 (termed the "terroir' by the French) play a varied 
 
 role in the growth and output of the grapevines, the 
 general effect of the climate is well known. Mild to 
 cool and wet winters followed by warm springs, then 
 hot summers with little (rain, snow, etc.) produce the best 
 wines (see Jones (1997) for a review). Therefore, 
 there is an best climate government that adds/gives 
 greatly to the overall quality of a given old/original. 
 Happening as a direct effect of climate, the 
 grapevine's growth can be described by its phenological events. Phenology is the study of individual 
 body-related events or growth stages of plants or 
 animals that happen again seasonally in response to climate. 
 Understanding the phenology of a given plant system 
 is important in deciding/figuring out the ability of a area 
 to produce a crop within the limits of/the walls of its (related to the Earth's weather) 
 government. From a farming/managing money viewpoint, knowledge of 
 a plant's growth stages is good as cultural 
 and chemical practices can be applied at best 
 times in a plant's once-a-year growth cycle. Also, 
 information (related to/looking at/thinking about) growth stages can be useful 
 in guessing crop yields. Vitis vinifera grapevines 
 ("wine-bearing vines") are a phenologically clear/separate 
 crop with the most important developmental stages 
 being debourrement (bud break), fioraison (flowering), veraison (color change and maturing undeveloped), 
 and harvest (grape maturity). 2 The timing of these 
 developmental stages is also related to the ability of 
 the vine to produce fruit, with early and fully expressed 
 (unhindered by extremes of heat or cold, storms, etc.) 
 phenological events usually resulting in larger yields 
 (Jones, 1997; Mullins et al., 1992). Also, the 
 phenological timing has been related to old/original quality with early harvests generally resulting in higher 
 quality wines (Ribereau-Gayon and Guimberteau, 
 1996). 
 Many studies looking at the relationship between 
 climate and quality have employed monthly averages 
 in temperature and (rain, snow, etc.) as the independent 
 (numbers that change/things that change) (for a good review see Gladstones, 1992). 
 Given that plants do not respond to a calendar division of climate data, and that phenological timing 
 and quality are related (Jones, 1997), each old/original 
 in the Bordeaux area is divided according to the 
 2 For the main red varieties grown in Bordeaux, bud break happens 
 in late March or early April, floraison happens in early June, veraison 
 happens from mid to late August, and harvest usually begins 
 at the end of September or in early October (Jones, 1997). 
 
 G.V. Jones, K.-H. Storchmann/Agricultural Money flow 26 (2001) 115-133 
 
 major phenological events of bud break, floraison, 
 veraison, and harvest, by that/in that way creating four stages 3 
 based upon the grapevine's once-a-year response to the 
 winning/most common climate (Jones and Davis, 2000a). This 
 allows for a complete analysis of the (related to the Earth's weather) 
 influences on the quality using a body-related approach. Climate (numbers that change/things that change) of (rain, snow, etc.), guessed 
 possible evapotranspiration (PET), 4 and the number 
 of days with temperatures more than 25 and 30Â°C are 
 summed by day and phenological stage to produce up 
 to four independent climate (numbers that change/things that change) per stage that 
 could (in the end) play a role in quality levels. 
 Nearing harvest time, key old/original (features/ qualities/ traits) 
 are the (percentages of different chemicals within a substance) of the grapes. Two of 
 the chief (things that decide other things) of crop ripeness are the relative amounts of sugar and acid found in the berries 
 leading up to harvest (Mullins et al., 1992). Sugar represents a measure of the potential alcohol content of 
 the wine and total (how much acid something has) is a measure of the fixed 
 and dangerous acids present in the berries and has a direct influence on wine color, the growth of yeast and 
 bacteria, and its pleasing balance with sugars on flavor qualities. During maturing, the levels of these 
 two measures generally go ahead in opposite directions: 
 sugar levels increase and acid levels decline (Amerine 
 et al., 1980). Best ripeness levels of sugar and 
 acid change/differ  by variety and area but should range between 165-230 g/1 of sugar and 3-9 g/1 of total (how much acid something has) (Winkler et al., 1974). In general, (compared to other things) high 
 sugar levels produce better quality while high acid levels produce lower quality (Ribereau-Gayon and Guimberteau, 1996; Jones and Davis, 2000b). In a perfect world, there 
 exists a ratio of sugar to acid that decides/figures out proper 
 ripeness and quality (possible greatness or power). 
 Daily climate data of highest temperature, highest temperature, and (rain, snow, etc.) for the Bordeaux station for 1949-1997 are received/got from 
 METEO-France (1998). The climate data are divided 
 3 For the rest of this analysis, each of the four stages will 
 be represented by D = the inactive stage (harvest of one year 
 to bud break of the next), B = the bud break stage (bud break 
 to floraison), F = the floraison stage (flowering to veraison), and 
 V = the veraison stage (veraison to harvest). 
 4 The PET (number or thing that changes) is equal to the sum of the average temperatures I: (Tmax - Tmin)/2 minus (rain, snow, etc.). It is a received/made from 
 temperature-related (number or thing that changes) that has been used to study the elimate/viticulture relationship. It is referred to as the Ribereau-Gayon 
 and Peynaud Index.

 by the mean phenology of the grapevines 5 from reference vineyards watched/followed by Ribereau-Gayon and 
 Guimberteau (1996, pers. commun.). Composition 
 values (acid and sugar levels) for Cabemet Sauvignon 
 and Merlot grapes for 1970-1997 are also supplied by 
 Ribereau-Gayon and Guimberteau (1996). Acid and 
 sugar levels are measured at the reference vineyards 
 before harvest and are averaged to get a single 
 value for each old/original and variety. Table 2 shows 
 the values for the significant climate (numbers that change/things that change) in the 
 analysis and grape composition for the years used in 
 the analysis. 
 The guessed equations for the climate effects on 
 Cabemet Sauvignon and Merlot grape composition are 
 shown in Table 3. Cabernet Sauvignon sugar levels 
 are influenced by (rain, snow, etc.) throughout the growing 
 season. Too much early season (rain, snow, etc.) (BPREC) 
 has a negative effect by delaying growth and late season (rain, snow, etc.) (FPREC and VPREC), especially 
 during the ripening period, has a bad effect by 
 possibly watering down the berries and producing lower relative sugar levels. Also many days of warm temperatures during floraison would mean that the grapes ripen 
 quickly and to a higher degree. Increased (rain, snow, etc.) 
 over the growing season increases the Cabernet Sauvignon acid levels and results in unripe grapes. On the 
 other hand, warm and dry conditions, especially from 
 flowering to harvest, allow the acid levels to decline 
 and the grapes to become ripe. A almost the same  set of climate influences on Merlot grape composition is seen 
 with warm and dry periods of growth providing higher 
 sugar levels while wetter periods occur with higher 
 acid levels. 
 
 2.2. Wine prices 
 The price of a wine is figured out by/decided by many different factors. One of the more important factors is

 Ribereau-Gayon and Guimberteau (1996, pers. commun.) and the 
 dates of bud break are guessed from climate data with bud growth

 - Model calculations: time 1980-1994, T-ratios in parentheses, and (numbers that change/things that change) as described in Table 2. 
 
 (examined closely) in this study certainly belong, can 
 (money made/good thing received) from increased (old/allowing to get old/getting older). The reasons for this are: 
 - On one hand, the (old/allowing to get old/getting older) (possible greatness or power) is  caused by the 
 slow development to maturity for many of the top 
 wines from Bordeaux. In its youth Bordeaux wines 
 are seen as an very high content of 
 tannins. In this state these wines are harsh and 
 not yet ready for drinking. But with increasing storage, generally 10 years or more, the tannins and harshness are reduced and the wine becomes more 
 pleasing to the sense of taste. This best drinking condition can last at least 20 years before the quality 
 begins to (lower in number/get worse). 
 - On the other hand, the available stock of a particular wine will decrease over time as it ages (i.e., 
 the product is ate/destroyed and the total (not enough of something) 
 increases). Therefore, in the price equations a changeable T ((popular thing/general way things are going)) is included that could be understood/explained 
 
 as a constant linear retirement function of a certain 
 (clear/separate) initial stock. It is true that data of total production could give useful added/more information, but these data are not publicly available in 
 the necessary detail. 
 - Also, the (old/allowing to get old/getting older) of a wine expresses storage 
 costs and opportunity costs (costs of tying down 
 capital as well as borrowing on credit). 
 Given the decline in available product, a continuously linear increasing changeable T ((popular thing/general way things are going)) is included into the model. The trend (number or thing that changes) starts with 
 1994 = 1 and ends with 1970 = 25, allowing for 
 the test of the effect of (old/allowing to get old/getting older) and (not enough of something) on 
 wine prices. Generally, the wine p1ice of a (pertaining to each person or thing) 
 house (Pi) would be expected to be related positively with Ti, for example: 
 (1) 
 
 122 
 
 G. V. Jones, K.-H. StorchmannlAgricultural Money flow 26 (2001) 115-133 
 
 where Si represents the (random/including random data points) error term. Here it is 
 especially repeated that Ti is not to be understood/explained 
 as a little bit of a time series model, but that it only 
 expresses different features of the wines (i.e., the state 
 of (old/allowing to get old/getting older)). 
 What's more, it is assumed that the wine price is 
 related positively with the relative (work of art/artistic combining of elements) of 
 the grapes. The price equation is referenced to the calculated sugar and acid equations given in the prior 
 section. According to the results, it can be assumed 
 that high sugar values have positive effects on wine 
 prices and that high acid values have a negative influence on the wine prices. 6 So the (detailed description of exactly what is required) has 
 the following form:

 Except some wines from the Pomerol area, Bordeaux Cru Classes 7 are blends of different varieties. 
 Overall, Cabemet Sauvignon and Merlot are the 
 main varieties grown in the area but other varieties 
 such as Cabemet Franc, Petit Verdot, and Malbec 
 are planted to different degrees throughout the area. 
 Although the shares of the single varieties used in 
 the wines change/differ  from (beautiful designs from the past) to old/original, the varietal 
 (things that are important) of the individual housex can be seen in 
 the area gave/reserved to growing the different varieties 
 (Table 4). Because of this, housex with Cabemet Sauvignonand Merlot-ruled wines can be distinguished 
 from one another and are carefully thought about/believed in the (detailed description of exactly what is required) of the price equations. 
 The international wine press regularly publishes 
 quality ratings and constantly updates them as long 
 as the wine remains available on the open market. 
 Although these ratings are influenced by personal (not definite) preferences (wine styles and varietal (combination of different substances, objects, people, etc.)), and do not lay claim to measurable (fair point of view), 
 6 On the influence of taste and chemical attributes of wine and 
 their hit/effect on consumption see Nerlove (1995) and Schneider 
 (1996). 
 7 For the western part of the Bordeaux area, the Medoc, a fivestage classification was introduced in 1855, which has mainly 
 remained the same. The list of Crus Classes includes 61 CMteaux. 
 The five Premier Cru Classes are CMteaux Haut Brion, LafiteRothschild, Latour, Margaux and, since 1973, Mouton-Rothschild. 
 In the second half of this century, classifications for the areas of 
 (places where bodies are buried) and St. Emilion have been introduced. A new classification 
 according to the old method was done/tried by Palefelter 
 (1997). 
 
 they are, however, able to deliver information (related to/looking at/thinking about) the current state and the development (possible power or ability within/possibility of) 
 single wines. Of the many wine writers, the most well 
 known and important is Robert M. Parker. His ratings, 
 based on a 100-point system, are widely used within 
 the industry as a gauge of relative quality. It must 
 be given special attention that once a old/original is given a point 
 rating, it is not permanently fixed, but is regularly 
 checked for quality changes at new tastings and, if 
 necessary, corrected. 8 However, since Parker-points 
 are orientated at the future (possible power or ability within/possibility of)  a wine, (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) 
 (old/allowing to get old/getting older) does not affect the rating. Because of this, Parker-points 
 do not cover the influence of the trend changeable T. 
 To get a single value for each old/original and for 
 each house, the following calculations are based on 
 the current Parker-point ratings from 1994/1995 as 
 given in Table 5. The high influence of Parker-points 
 on buying-related patterns and wine prices is undisputed 
 (e.g., see Kiihler and Kiihler, 1995; Palefelter and 
 Jones, 2000), and can be recognized by the "shooting 
 stars" housex which were "discovered" by Parker. 
 Therefore, the price function can be extended by a 
 (number or thing that changes) called PT (Parker-points) 
 
 In the case where wines of particular wines were 
 not traded (e.g., the Cheval Blanc of 1991), a dummy 
 (number or thing that changes) is included in the equation. Dummy (numbers that change/things that change) 
 can also show/tell about weird items like a change of an owner 
 or cellarmaster, modernization of production facilities, 
 etc., whose influence could not be described (good or well enough) by the introduced (numbers that change/things that change). This happens especially to the old/original 1982. The extreme high sale 
 prices cannot be explained for all housex (good or well enough) 
 by age, sugar and acid values, and Parker-points. 
 Therefore, for this year a dummy (number or thing that changes) is introduced under the idea (you think is true) that only a small 
 amount of product is available on the open market. 
 Also, (things that decide other things) which are time-invariant, 
 such as slope, aspect, soil (i.e., Pomerol, 1989) or 
 Cru-classification, etc. generally do not cause once-a-year 
 quality differences/different versions, but mainly decide/figure out the price 
 level and are included in the equation by a constant. 
 8 Amazing (reductions of value) happen often in the re-test of the 
 wines. For instance the CMteau Mouton-Rothschild and House 
 Latour from 1979 suffered a downgrading from 85 to 72 and from 
 90 to 85 points, (match up each pair of items in order). See Kiihler and Kiihler (1995).

 All guessed price equations for the 21 selected 
 housex are given in Table 6. The results show/tell about that 
 wine prices react with great sensitivity to differences/different versions 
 in the sugar/acid ratio as well as Parker-points. Therefore, both (numbers that change/things that change) are included in a polynomial form 
 in the function and cause above average elasticities (related to/looking at/thinking about) changes of the (thing that you control (like study time), that causes something else to change (like a test score)). Because of this, 
 the effects of an increase of Parker-points from 94 to 
 95 are clearly much higher than those caused by an 
 increase from 84 to 85. The same can be seen for 
 the sugar/acid ratio (which is often used to test 
 ripeness). Also, wine prices tend to increase 
 with (old/allowing to get old/getting older) and, except for House Petrus and Talbot, 
 the trend (number or thing that changes) (T) was introduced in a linear form 
 in the equations. Finally, all equations contain one or 
 two dummy (numbers that change/things that change) which point to/show either corrections 
 for the (before that/before now) talked about/said very high 1982 prices, 
 missing data of single wines, or some other change 
 with which data are not available. 
 
 for this study, the Cheval Blanc equation was specified 
 as a Merlot equation. However, for the overall results, 
 the MAPE-values in the range 7-26% are to be judged 
 against the background of the very high dangerous nature/wild up and down prices of the (things that change (like test scores) because of other things that you control (like study times)). So the percentage 
 mistakes are naturally high when the explained (number or thing that changes), the wine price, goes up and down near zero, although 
 the (change to make better/related to changing something) of the equation is quite acceptable. In 
 those cases the explanatory power of the MAE and the 
 RMSE is higher and, compared to the dimension of 
 the (thing that changes (like a test score) because of something else that you control (like study time)), these tests are more medium-level. 
 The MEAN ratio points to/shows that the (numbers that change/things that change) hardly 
 are under- or over-guessed. An underestimation of 5 
 US-$/bottle in the case of House Mouton Rothschild 
 would appear, against the background of the dimension of its prices, to be very small.

 To test the quality of an econometric model 
 the properties of the model and its explanatory power 
 should be checked by a few (related to studying numbers) tests. Important indications can be gained from a comparison between the actual data and a (happening together) 
 "ex-post"-solution of the model. From the many test statistics available, those employed in this research are: 
 - the mean error, MEAN= *L:?=r CYi - Yi), 
 - the mean total error, MAE= *L:?=l I.Yi - yi[, 
 - the root mean square error, 
 RMSE = *)L?=r (Yi- the mean total percentage error, 
 MAPE = !nL...z=i 
 "'! Iji;-y; 
 I- 
 y; 
 Yi) 2 , 
 
 The statistics above are examined to test the quality of the complete wine price model. The test results, 
 as got together in Table 7, show a acceptable improvement over the watched/followed data, especially in respect to 
 the sugar and acid values, while the MAPE for the 
 wine prices is much higher. This is especially true for 
 House Cheval Blanc, which has a 26% mean total percentage error. This large MAPE can mainly be 
 attributed to the high share of Cabernet Franc in its 
 blend. Since Cabernet Franc data were not available

 a Model calculations: PX stands for wine price and is followed by an shortening of the house in the model. 
 
 of four housex are shown. Overall the model is able 
 to reflect the actual data very well. Even for filled with problems cases, like House Cheval Blanc, the explanatory 
 power of the model falls within an acceptable range. 
 
 3. Sensitivity analysis 
 In the model introduced in this analysis, the influence of single (things that decide other things) on the wine price can 
 be separated and tested. One of the advantages of 
 an econometric model, in contrast to (intelligent/obvious) methods, is that in the extent of/the range of sensitivity analysis a difference/different version of one of these (things that decide other things) can be tested out 
 as well as the hits/effects put into numbers. Since the model is 
 thin sliceal, only the average effect of these factors 
 on the wines of different wines for single housex 
 can be calculated. Therefore, with the model, it is not 
 possible to (describe the future) the development of prices of one 
 single wine, for instance the House Cheval Blanc 
 
 1982. For this purpose a time series model would be 
 necessary, which explains the development of the price 
 of one single wine over a long period of time, not 
 only by the (features/ qualities/ traits) of the wine itself, but also 
 by money-based test result data and their inter-time-related 
 differences/different versions. However, in the extent of/the range of the model introduced in this analysis, it is possible to number the 
 hit/effect on average prices for all wines of a given year 
 (here 199611997) and for single housex, by the difference/different version of one or a few (coming from the outside of something) (numbers that change/things that change). Because of this, 
 the influence of (related to the Earth's weather) (things that decide other things), Parker ratings, 
 and the hit/effect of (old/allowing to get old/getting older) can be put into numbers. 
 3.1. Climate sensitivity 
 As described earlier, the main varieties of the Bordeaux wines are seen as different (related to the Earth's weather) influences. In the same way/in that way, one purpose of blending wines 
 is to balance the disadvantages resulting from weather 
 conditions of a particular old/original which in turn affect

 In comparison, price decreases for typical Cabernet Sauvignon-ruled wines like Haut Brion 
 (-5.3%) or Mouton-Rothschild (-8.6%) are (in an obvious way) less. Although Merlot-ruled wines are 
 clearly under-represented among the (examined closely) 
 wines, Fig. 3 shows that with increasing Cabernet 
 Sauvignon shares planted (Table 4), the paying/making up for character of that variety becomes obvious and 
 therefore the price sensitivity decreases. 
 3.2. Parker-point sensitivity 
 
 the ripeness of the different vanetles (Kiihler and 
 Kiihler, 1995). Since the weather during the ripening 
 period plays an important role in the grape quality, a 
 model (testing out) of the influence of a cooler, wetter period from veraison to harvest on sugar, acid, 
 and price is tested. In this picture/situation the (coming from the outside of something) (numbers that change/things that change) VPET (a measure of overall heat and 
 dryness), VTEMP25, and VTEMP30 were reduced 
 by 25% (which could easily happen within the (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) 
 climate (quality of changing over time or at different places)), while VPREC was assumed to 
 be 25% higher (see Table 2 for shortenings). The 
 results of this (testing out) show/tell about that sugar and acid 
 values of Merlot are much more sensitive in respect 
 to differences/different versions in veraison stage climate as is Cabernet 
 Sauvignon (Table 8). Due to the (like the real thing) poorer 
 veraison stage climate conditions, the sugar values 
 for Cabernet Sauvignon decrease by 2.46 g/1 (1.3% ), 
 while those for Merlot decrease by 5.47 g/1 (2.7%). In 
 respect to the tested out acid values, the differences 
 are even more significant: the acid values for Cabernet Sauvignon increase by 5% and increase by 17% 
 for Merlot. From the prior climate analysis and the 
 tests, it is confirmed that the Merlot variety is 
 much more sensitive in respect to climate influences 
 during the ripening period than Cabernet Sauvignon. 
 Overall, one can go ahead on the idea (you think is true) that 
 Merlot-ruled wines, in respect to quality as well 
 as price, are usually more influenced by weather 
 (features/ qualities/ traits) during the critical ripening stage than 
 Cabernet Sauvignon- ruled wines. Table 9 displays the climate hits/effects on the wine prices. From 
 the given picture/situation of a wetter, cooler ripening stage, 
 all prices decrease, but it should be noted that 
 this happens to a higher degree with non-Cabernet 
 Sauvignon wines like Cheval Blanc (-31.3%), 
 Petrus (-21.1%), and Troplong Greatt (-14.1%). 
 
 The very high influence of quality ratings on 
 wine prices has often been talked about/said, and sometimes 
 hated, in the trade press. In the (detailed description of exactly what is required) of 
 the equations, this influence is expressed by including Parker-points in a polynomial form. It is obvious 
 that Parker-points are oriented by "goal chemical quality measures", by which there often appears a 
 close relationship to the above talked about/said climate (things that decide other things). However, since the test statistics are highly 
 significant, the problem of multicollinearity can be 
 neglected. 9 The wine pricing reactions caused by a 
 one-point increase in the Parker rating is shown in 
 Table 9. From the results it is clear that there are 
 great differences between particular housex in respect to Parker-point elasticities of the prices. While 
 the price from this (testing out) for Housex Beychevelle or Palmer has risen less than 4%, properties like 
 Housex Margaux, La Mission Haut Brion or Pichon 
 Comtesse de Lalande show price increases over 10%. 
 As shown in the following equation, these differences 
 are due to many of factors.

 First, it is obvious that the wine's blend in respect to 
 the Parker-point sensitivity is very important. While 
 high Cabernet Sauvignon shares have the habit/desire 
 to increase the dependence on external ratings, the 
 rating sensitivity will be decreased by higher shares 
 of Merlot. Secondly, the dependence on Parker-points 
 is higher for smaller properties. Therefore, smaller 
 housex often gain over-(fair in amount, related to something else/properly sized compared to something else)ly from higher 
 ratings. Third, those housex which were already 
 rated rela<p><strong>NOTE: This document is incomplete. It was shortened to the maximum document length of 50,000 characters.</strong></p><div style="clear:both">&nbsp;</div>
