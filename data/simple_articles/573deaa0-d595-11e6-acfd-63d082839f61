 Abstract 
 The hit/effect of (having different things working together as one unit) pest management (IPM) on bug-killer use, poisonous quality and other (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) (features/ qualities/ traits), yields, and farm 
 (money made/good things received) is examined for grape growers. The method is generally related for technology adoption and accounts for self-selectivity, 
 (happening at the same time), and possible (state of always working or appearing the same way). IPM adopters apply much less insecticides and fungus-killers than nonadopters among grape 
 producers in six states, accounting for most of the U.S. production. Both the average poisonous quality and the (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) Impact Quotient 
 decrease (a) little with adoption of insect IPM, but remain about the same for adopters and nonadopters of IPM for sicknesses. The effect of 
 IPM adoption on produces and changeable (money made/good things received) is positive but only significant for the case of IPM for sicknesses, (in other words), the adoption of IPM for 
 sicknesses increases produces and (money made/good things received) significantly. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

 1. Introduction 
 (even though there is the existence of) their positive effect on farming-based production, proven true by the desire of U.S. farmers to spend US$7. 7 billion on bug-killers in 1995 
 (USDA, 1997), the possible effects of bug-killers to 
 human health and (the health of the Earth/the surrounding conditions) have caused increased concern Huang et al., 1994. In 1993, the 
 U.S. Department of Farming (USDA), the Food 
 and Drug Management, and the (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) 
 Protection (service business/government unit/power/functioning) promised to work together to reduce the health and (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) risks connected

 with bug-killer use. As (Combined different things together so they worked as one unit) Pest Management 
 (IPM) ways of doing things were designed to address some of 
 the health and (worries about the health of the Earth) of bug-killers, 
 the USDA has set a goal for the use of IPM on 75% 
 of U.S. farmland by the year 2000. 
 Fruit and vegetable production is especially intensive in bug-killers. Per area of land  expenses on bug-killers by fruit and vegetable growers are nearly seven 
 times the farming-based average (Fernandez-Cornejo et 
 al., 1994). Also, concerns about bug-killer 
 residues are especially important in fruits and vegetables, often filled with/eaten with little postharvest processing National College/school of Sciences, 1987. Grape 
 was the top U.S. fruit crop in terms of land 
 (761,000) and value of production (US$1.8 billion) 
 in 1994 (USDA, 1995). Grape and wine production 
 dates back more then 4000 years and extends over

 all continents. Besides U.S. and traditional (related to Europe) 
 producers, grapes are grown a lot in some 
 countries in Eastern Europe, parts of the former 
 Soviet Union, Africa (Algeria and South Africa), 
 Australia, Asia, and South America. 
 IPM includes an mixed group of ways of doing things designed to maintain pest (situations where large numbers of harmful or disgusting things exist) at (money-based)/cheaply 
 acceptable levels rather than trying to completely destroy all pests Vandeman et al., 1994. 
 While there are a few idea-based definitions of 
 IPM, according to the USDA: "IPM is a management approach that encourages natural control of 
 pest (groups of people/animals/things) by expecting pest problems and 
 preventing pests from reaching (money-based)/cheaply damaging levels. All appropriate ways of doing things are used such 
 as improving natural enemies, planting pest-resistant 
 crops, adapting cultural management, and using bug-killers wisely." (USDA, 1993). 
 While the adoption of IPM has been carefully studied by 
 a few (people who work to find information) (Norton and Mullen, 1994), there 
 are few farm-level econometric studies on the effect 
 of IPM on bug-killer use, crop yields, and farm 
 (money made/good things received) (Underground tunnels, 1983; Hall and Duncan, 1984; 
 Wetzstein et al., 1985; Smith et al., 1987; 
 Fernandez-Cornejo, 1996). No study has been published carefully studying grape production. More than that, little 
 farm-level scientific research has been published on 
 the effect of IPM on the overall poisonous quality and other 
 (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) (features/ qualities/ traits) of bug-killers and claims 
 that bug-killers used in IPM differ from those used on 
 a (serving to stop something bad before it happens) or (usually done) schedule (Allen et al., 1987) 
 have not been scientifically examined. This paper 
 presents a (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) to examine the hit/effect of IPM 
 on bug-killer use, poisonous quality and other (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) 
 (features/ qualities/ traits) of the bug-killers, crop yields, and 
 farm (money made/good things received), and calculates the hit/effect of IPM for 
 U.S. grape growers. 
 
 2. Potential health and (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) effects of 
 bug-killer use 
 The reported undesirable effects of bug-killers on 
 nontarget species, including humans, include the following: sudden and long-lasting health effects (Clark et al., 
 1977; EPA, 1976b; Hayes and Vaughn, 1977); domestic animal poisonings (Cadwell et al., 1977); and 
 
 effects on wild birds and (milk-producing animals), fish, bees, helpful organisms, and small organisms in the soil 
 (Bairlein, 1990; Brown, 1978; EPA, 1976a; Martin, 
 1978; Van Steenwyk et al., 1975; Pimentel et al., 
 1991.) 
 A bug-killer presents/causes a risk to human health and the 
 (surrounding conditions) if it is poisonous  and if humans and other 
 species are exposed to the bug-killer (Cohrs sen and 
 Covello, 1988). Human poisonous quality is usually guessed 
 from experimental data on mammalian poisonous quality. 
 Mammalian poisonous quality includes sudden (short-term) and 
 long-lasting (long-term, low-level exposure) poisonous quality. 
 Long-lasting poisonous quality includes cancer causing (ability 
 to produce cancer), cancer-causing thingicity (ability to cause 
 (related to tiny chemical assembly instructions inside of living things) changes in living cells), and harmfulity 
 (ability to produce bad things or serious mistakes from (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy)ity). 
 There are hundreds of bug-killer active ingredients 
 and each has a different spectrum of pest control and 
 a different hit/effect on human health and (the health of the Earth/the surrounding conditions) (Fernandez-Cornejo and Jans, 1995). So, it is 
 convenient to summarize the poisonous quality of bug-killers in 
 an overall index. A few methods have been proposed but there is no agreement about the scales and 
 the weights assigned to the parts/pieces of the index. 
 This paper uses the overall index of human poisonous quality 
 proposed by Fernandez-Cornejo and Jans (1995). 
 This index (LTI) is the average of three parts/pieces, 
 with equal weights, each scaled from 0 to 4, the 0 
 going along with/matching up to nontoxic effect. The LAI part summarizes the acute poisonous quality resulting from the 
 five different measures thought about/believed by the EPA. LAI 
 is equal to 4 if the active ingredient belongs to 
 poisonous quality category I (danger) of the EPA classification; (in almost the same way) LAI is equal to 3, 2, and 1 for 
 categories II, III, and IV, (match up each pair of items in order). The long-lasting 
 element of the index (LCI) is assigned a lower score 
 for weaker indications of cancer causing. Following 
 Hammitt (1986), LCI is equal to 4 if the bug-killer is 
 a cancer-causer; LCI is equal to 2 if the bug-killer is not 
 a reported cancer-causer but is a neoplastigen (or oncogenic, (in other words), it can produce tumors) and is equal to 0.5 
 if the bug-killer is neither cancer-causing nor oncogenic, 
 but is cancer-causing thingic (pointing to/showing possible cancer causing). Finally, the LTI part is equal to 4 if the 
 bug-killer is harmful. 
 The possible result of bug-killers on human health 
 and (the health of the Earth/the surrounding conditions) is about put into numbers us- 
 
 J. Fernandez-Cornejo/ Farming-based Money flow 18 ( 1998) 145-155 
 
 ing the (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) Quotient Index (Kovach et al., 
 1992). The EIQ has three parts/pieces based on the 
 three possibly affected elements: the farm worker, 
 the person, and the ecology. The EIQ measures 
 the hit/effect of each bug-killer active ingredient by 
 assigning an equal weight to each of its three parts/pieces and has a scale of 1 to 5. The farmworker 
 part includes sudden and long-lasting elements and 
 is calculated from (milk-producing animal)  poisonous quality and toughness. 
 The personal part is based on long-lasting poisonous quality, toughness, and sistemicity. The (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) part is calculated from fish, bird, bee, and helpful insect poisonous quality; leaking and surface loss 
 (possible greatness or power), and toughness. 
 
 3. Bug-killer use and IPM in grape production 
 Grape production in the U.S. uses a variety of 
 bug-killers. As Table 1A shows, fungus-killers are applied to 93% of the land gave/reserved to grape production; insecticides are used in 66% of the grape areas of land; 
 
 147 
 
 and herbicides are used on 64%. Among the important fungus-killers used, sulfur is first followed by mancozeb, copper oxychoride sulphate, captan, and myclobuthanil (USDA, 1994). Cryolite is the most a lot used insecticide, followed by propargite, 
 and carbaryl. Commercial bioinsecticides based on 
 the germ Germ thuringensis (Bt) are only 
 used on 2% of the areas of land (USDA, 1994). 
 The use of IPM in grape production can be traced 
 back to the late 1950s when the grape leafhopper 
 Erythroneura beautifulula developed resistance to (produced by people/not naturally-occurring) organic bug-killers and (related to the body function of living things) upsets of the 
 spider mites and the grape mealybug followed 
 (Flaherty et al., 1992). Farming-based scientists from 
 the University of California, supported by the grape 
 industry, prepare to a practical management system (combining different things together so they work as one unit) chemical, cultural, and (related to the body function of living things) controls (Flaherty et al., 1992). IPM was 
 developed further in the 1960s with the use of 
 predaceous mites and insects and cover crops; and in 
 the 1970s and 1980s with the use of selective pesti-

 4. The possible (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) 
 4.1. Possible issues 
 
 An econometric model developed to guess the 
 hit/effect of IPM adoption using survey data must take 
 into account three possible issues. (1) Farmers' 
 IPM adoption decisions and bug-killer use may be 
 (happening together) due mainly to unmeasured (numbers that change/things that change) 
 related to both IPM adoption and bug-killer 
 demand such as size of the pest population, pest 
 resistance, farm location, and grower perceptions 
 about pest control (Underground tunnels, 1983). (2) Growers are 
 not assigned randomly to the two groups (adopters 
 and nonadopters of IPM), but they make the adoption choices themselves. Since adopters and nonadopters may be in a planned way different, these differences may show themselves in farm performance and could be confused with differences due 
 purely to IPM adoption. This situation, known as 
 self-selectivity must be corrected to prevent (unfairly influencing an opinion) 
 the results (Greene, 1993). (3) The demand for bug-killers is a received/made from demand, and must be consistent 
 with farmers' optimization behavior, such as profit 
 (biggest increase/best possible extent). 
 In end/end result, model (detailed description of exactly what is required) should allow 
 for (happening at the same time) and self-selectivity. Also, the 
 demand and supply functions should be came/coming from 
 a (money made/good thing received) (or cost) function. 
 4.2. The adoption decision 
 
 The adoption of a new technology is a choice 
 between two other choices, the usual technology 
 and the new one and growers are assumed to make 
 decisions by choosing the other choice that (makes as big as possible) 
 their perceived utility (Fernandez-Cornejo et al., 
 1994). So, grower i is likely to adopt IPM if the 
 utility of adopting, &#126; 1 , is higher than the utility of 
 not adopting, &#126; 0 . However, only the binary random 
 (number or thing that changes) Ii (taking the value of 1 if IPM is adopted 
 and zero otherwise) is watched/followed, as utility is not 
 known to the analyst for sure and is treated as 
 a random (number or thing that changes) (Ben-Akiva and Lerman, 1985). 
 
 In the big picture  of IPM adoption: Uij = Vu + eii- 
 where &#126;i is the planned part of U, related 
 to the profitabilities of adopting (j = 1) and not 
 adopting (j = 0). Assuming that the disturbances 
 (eii) are independently and identically (usually/ in a common and regular way) distributed, then their difference will also be (usually/ in a common and regular way) 
 distributed and the probit change can be used 
 to model the farmer's adoption decision. So, the 
 chance of adoption equation is P(/k = 1) = 
 F( y&#126;Zk) where Ik represents the adoption of IPM for 
 insects (k = 1) and sicknesses (k = 2), F points to/shows the 
 total (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) distribution, and the vector Z 
 includes the factors influencing adoption. 
 The equations for the adoption of IPM for insects 
 and sicknesses guessed using the probit model are: 
 11 = L.iy 1iZ 1i + &#126;-t 1 and / 2 = L./y2 iZ2 i + J-t 2 - The 
 parts/pieces Zi of the vector Z include the following 
 factors of adoption: farm size, output price, farmer 
 education and experience, off-farm labor, use of 
 extension and talking to services, (based on a written agreement) arrangements for the production/marketing of the crop, 
 and type of grape grown (i.e., wine or table grape 
 varieties). Both probit equations have the same move backwardors. . 
 Heckman's two-step procedure (Heckman, 1976) 
 is changed to account for (happening at the same time) in addition to 
 self-selectivity. The first step includes the guess 
 of the limits/guidelines 'Yk of the probit equations. The 
 inverse Mills ratio Ak = c/J( y&#126;Z/ up)jcJJ( y&#126;Z/ uP-) is 
 also guessed for each (instance of watching, noticing, or making a statement), where c/J( Â·) and 
 iP( Â·) are the density and the distribution function of 
 the standard (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy), and uP- is the standard moving away of 1-tk (Greene, 1993; Maddala, 1983). More than that, to account for (happening at the same time), Ik being endogenous, the (described the future) chances (received/got from the 
 probit equations) are used as instrumental (numbers that change/things that change) 
 for Ik in the second stage, discussed next. 
 
 4.3. Modeling the hit/effect of !PM 
 
 The hit/effect of IPM on bug-killer use, yields, and 
 farm (money made/good things received) is examined by guessing the bug-killer 
 demand functions, the supply function, and the changeable profit function as a (happening together) system. To 
 account for self selectivity, the inverse Mills ratios 
 Xk (received/got from the first stage) are extra as 
 added/more move backwardors to the supply, demand, and 
 profit equations. 
 
 J. Fernandez-Cornejo/ Farming-based Money flow 18 (1998) 145-155 
 
 The well-developed restricted profit function (Diewert, 1974) is used to guess possibly consistent supply, demand, and profit equations (Fernandez-Cornejo, 1994). Let Y represent the vector of 
 outputs, X the vector of changeable inputs, S the vector 
 of nonnegative almost-fixed inputs; R is the vector of 
 other factors such as locational or weather proxies 
 and also includes as parts/pieces the (described the future) chances of IPM adoption received/got in the first stage; P 
 is the price vector of outputs, and W is the price 
 vector of (number or thing that changes) inputs. The restricted profit function is defined by: 
 7T(P, W,S,R) 
 
 = 
 
 MaxXY(P'Y- W' X;X,Y 
 
 E 
 
 T) 
 
 The production possibilities set T is assumed to 
 be nonempty, closed, bounded, and curving out cone. 
 Under these ideas (you think are true) on the technology, the restricted profit function is well defined and makes happy 
 the usual (happening over and over again in a predictable way) conditions (Diewert, 1974). In 
 particular, with some of the inputs fixed, 7T is (group of things that are all pretty much the same) of degree one in output and changeable input 
 prices and almost-fixed input amounts. 
 (thinking about/when one thinks about) land (L) as a fixed input and using 
 the evenness conditions, the restricted profit 
 function can be expressed as 7T(P,W,L,R) = L. 
 iT(P,W,R), where is the per area of land  profit function: 
 iT= Maxyx(P'Y- W' X) andY= Y jL,X = XjL 
 are the per area of land  output and input amount vectors. By 
 Hotteling-Shephard's lemma, the per area of land  output 
 supply and input demand functions are then given by 
 Y= aiT(P, W,R)jaP and i = aiT(P, W,R);aw. 
 The model is scientifically guessed by using a 
 (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy)ized quadratic changeable profit function (Diewert and Ostensoe, 1988). (thinking about/when one thinks about) the case of a 
 single output, grapes, (impressive/forcing (on people)/causing an inconvenient situation) matching by sharing 
 limits/guidelines and linear evenness by (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy)ization, 
 using the labor price as the numeraire, (adding to the end) the 
 inverse Mills ratio terms as added/more move backwardors, and 
 adding the disturbance terms, the per area of land  profit 
 function, per area of land  supply function, and per area of land 
 insecticide and fungus-killer demand functions are:

 where now, Y, P, a, H, and the e's are scalars; and 
 F and G are column matrices. The vector R includes 
 seven parts/pieces: two farm attributes (farm size 
 and off-farm labor), a dummy for the type of grape 
 produced, the (described the future) chances of adoption of 
 IPM for insects and sicknesses received/got from the probit model, and two dummies to account for pest 
 (situation where something is filled with lots of something harmful or disgusting) levels. 
 
 5. Data and guess 
 The data were gotten from the Farming-based 
 Chemical Use Survey and its Money-based Follow-On 
 for fruits, given/gave between the fall of 1993 and 
 the spring of 1994 by the National Farming-based 
 Statistics Service of the U.S. Department of Farming. The chance sample was drawn from a list 
 frame based on all known commercial fruit growers 
 who have at least an area of land  of production. A layered 
 sampling way of doing things was used, where each layer is 
 a (impossible for both to exist together at the same time) set of the valuable things. 
 The survey included fresh market, processing, and 
 wine grape crops grown in California, Michigan, 
 New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Washington, 
 covering 743,000 areas of land (Table lA) and accounting 
 for most of the U.S. land (USDA, 1995). The pest 
 management section of the survey was completed by 
 691 grape-producing growers (Table lB), but after 
 leaving out/keeping out (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) with missing values only 609 
 usable (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) were available for econometric 
 analysis. 
 The largest proportion of the producers in the 
 sample grew wine grape varieties in 1993 (about 
 80%) followed by raisin, fresh market, and juice 
 grape varieties (about 10% each). However, the proportion of the land growing wine grape varieties 
 
 150 
 
 J. Fernandez-Cornejo/ Farming-based Money flow 18 (1998) 145-155 
 
 was lower because farms growing wine varieties 
 tend to be smaller (for example, the sample average 
 size for farms growing wine varieties was about 380 
 areas of land compared to almost 2500 areas of land for farms growing raisin varieties). (in almost the same way), while more than 80% 
 of the 1993 grape land was located in California 
 (Table 1A), the percent of the farms located in 
 California is much lower, because grape farms in 
 California are larger that in other states. For example, the sample average grape land in California 
 was 3170, while that of New York was 194 and 
 Oregon 41 (Table 1B). For this reason, the proportion of California farms in the sample was only 
 about 20%, almost the same as  that of New York, Michigan, 
 Oregon and Pennsylvania (Table lB). 
 It is hard to provide a general operational 
 definition of IPM since IPM programs are (designed only for/happening only within) 
 the crop and area for which they are designed and 
 development of IPM programs has not been uniform 
 across pest classes (e.g., insects, plant germs, 
 weeds), crops, and areas. Most previous econometric studies have dealt with IPM adoption in general, 
 without further (detailed description of exactly what is required) of the pest classes that 
 are managed or controlled. While there is good quality/good qualities in 
 keeping the definition general, added/more understanding about the (blocking things) to adoption, as well as the 
 effects of IPM, is gained by further describing 
 IPM. So, this paper thinks about/believes separately IPM to 
 manage insects and sicknesses. 
 In our operational definition of IPM, a fanner is 
 said to have adopted IPM to manage insects (sicknesses) (i) if the fanner reports having used both 
 scouting for insects (sicknesses) and money-based dividing lines in making insecticide (fungus-killer) treatment decisions, and (ii) the fanner reports the use of one or 
 more added/more insect (disease) management practices among those carefully thought about/believed to be IPM ways of doing things. 
 Added/more IPM ways of doing things included the use of 
 chemicals; use of resistant varieties; (going back and forth/doing one then the other) 
 bug-killers to slow the development of pest resistance 
 to bug-killers; (changing to make better/changing to fit new conditions) planting dates to lessen pest 
 problems; soil testing for pests; trimming; buying 
 helpful organisms that prey on pests; (changing to make better/changing to fit new conditions) 
 application rates, timing, and frequency of bug-killer 
 use to protect helpful organisms; and use of insecticides less harmful to helpful insects. 
 The number of insecticide (fungus-killer) applications 
 per year are used as a measure of bug-killer use. The 
 
 average number of bug-killer uses was calculated by dividing the sum (over all active ingredients 
 in the given bug-killer class) of the treatment areas of land by 
 the number of areas of land treated. Equally, bug-killer prices were figured out/calculated in dollars per insecticide 
 (fungus-killer) use per area of land. Per area of land  (number or thing that changes) 
 (money made/good things received) are defined as per area of land  money/money income (grape prices 
 times yields) minus per area of land  (number or thing that changes) costs (insecticides, fungus-killers, and connected labor costs). 
 Unlike simple random sampling, the selection of 
 an individual farm for the survey was not equally 
 likely across all farms on the list because the sample 
 was layered. Weighted least squares guess 
 methods were used to correct for bias, with weights 
 equal to the inverse of the chance of selection. 
 The probit equations were guessed separately. Because the errors of the guessing equations for the 
 second stage (Eqs. (1)-(4)) could be related, and 
 to gain guess (wasting very little while working or producing something), the per area of land  supply and 
 demand equations were guessed together with the 
 per area of land  profit function in an cycled-through (appearing to be) 
 Unrelated Moving backward (ITSUR) (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) (Zellner, 
 1962). However, ITSUR ways of doing things were not needed 
 for the probit, because the move backwardors are the same 
 across all the equations and there are no possible 
 restrictions for the moving backward coefficients (Dwivedi 
 and Srivastava, 1978). The hit/effect of IPM adoption 
 on bug-killer use, yields, and farm (money made/good things received) was calculated from Eqs. (1)-(4). For example, the effect of a 
 change in the chance of adoption of insect IPM 
 on insecticide use was calculated from Eq. (3) since 
 3X 1 /3R 3 = E13 . In ability to stretch form, the effect of 
 adoption of insect IPM on insecticide use is E 13 
 (R 3 /X 1 ). The elasticities reported were calculated at 
 the means. 
 
 6. Results 
 Tables 1B and 2 present a summary of the means 
 of the data for grape farms. Table 1B provides the

 (related to/looking at/thinking about) the results from the probit (moving backwards), 
 both (moving backwards) are highly significant, as measured 
 by chance ratio tests (only one probit-moving backward 
 guesses are shown in Table 3 for lack of space, 
 other results are available upon request). Among the 
 (meaningful numbers) (numbers that change/things that change), the coefficient of 
 the operator's off-farm work activities, measured by 
 the number of off-farm work hours is negative, as 
 expected, confirming that the availability of operator 
 labor has a positive influence on IPM adoption. This 
 backs up (with proof) other findings (McNamara et al., 1991; 
 Fernandez-Cornejo et al., 1994) that off-farm employment may present a restriction to IPM adoption, 
 because it competes for on-farm managerial time, as 
 IPM needs/demands a big amount of operator's time. 
 Farmer experience is negatively related to 
 adoption. This negative sign may be due to the 
 relationship of experience with the age of the operator 
 and would point to/show that older farmers are more unwilling to accept newer ways of doing things. Farmer education is 
 positively related to adoption, as expected, but 
 use of extension and consultants is not significantly 
 related to IPM adoption. The size (number or thing that changes) is positive 
 and significant, confirming other studies that operators of larger farms are more likely to adopt inventions of new things. The type-of-grape dummy is also significantly 
 negative, pointing to/showing that wine grape growers are less 
 likely to adopt IPM than table grape producers. 
 Table 3 also presents the guessed limits/guidelines of 
 the insecticide and fungus-killer demand functions and 
 the per area of land  supply function. The overall goodness of 
 fit is good for all three equations ((changed to make better/changed to fit new conditions) R 2 = 
 0.27), given the thin sliceal nature of the study. 
 The coefficients of the inverse Mills ratios are significant in the supply and profit equations, confirming 
 that self-selection does happen. 
 Insecticide use is negatively and significantly related to the adoption of insect IPM. (in almost the same way), fungus-killer use is negatively and significantly related to the 
 adoption of IPM for sicknesses. The ability to stretch of bug-killer demand with respect to the chance of adoption of the similar IPM (calculated at the 
 mean) is -0.26 for the case of insecticides and 
 -0.10 for fungus-killers (Table 4). That is, a 10% 
 increase in the chance of adoption of IPM for 
 insects would decrease the number of insecticide 
 applications by nearly 3% and a 10% increase in the 
 chance of adoption of IPM for sicknesses would

 decrease the number of fungus-killer applications by

 Table 3 also shows that the hit/effect of IPM on 
 yields is positive for both insect and disease IPM, 
 although this effect is not significant for insect IPM. 
 About a third of the ITSUR limit/guideline guesses for 
 the profit function (not shown but available upon 
 request) are significant at the 1% level. .The effect of 
 IPM adoption on (money made/good things received) is positive but only significant for IPM for sicknesses: the ability to stretch of changeable 
 farm (money made/good things received) with respect to the chance of adoption of IPM for sicknesses is 0.39 (Table 4). This result 
 means that an increase of 10% in the chance of 
 adoption of IPM for sicknesses would increase changeable 
 makes money by almost 4%. 
 Our results are agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with those of Hall 
 (1977) in that IPM reduced bug-killer use. However, 
 the evidence on the effect of IPM on 
 bug-killer use is mixed, even for a given crop. Among 
 econometric studies, Underground tunnels (1983) found that IPM 
 adoption lead to a big reduction in bug-killer 
 expenses for a sample of California cotton growers, but Carlson (1980) refers to (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) of "both 
 (completing/matching) and substitute relationships between 
 scouting and bug-killer use'' among cotton producers 
 in North Carolina, and Wetzstein et al. (1985) found 
 that "IPM has no effect on bug-killer expenses" 
 among a sample of Georgia cotton farmers. There is 
 little econometric results on the hit/effect of IPM among 
 
 J. Fernandez-Cornejo j Farming-based Money flow 18 ( 1998) 145-155 
 
 fruit producers (Norton and Mullen, 1994); Fernandez-Cornejo and J ans ( 1996) found that IPM did not 
 have a significant effect on insecticide use for a 
 sample of orange producers in California and Florida. 
 Having decided/figured out that IPM reduces overall bug-killer use for grape growers, we also examine the 
 hit/effect of IPM on major bug-killer active ingredients. 
 We focus on 11 active ingredients which represent 
 more than 90% of the insecticides and fungus-killers 
 used on grapes. As shown in Table 5, on the average, adopters of insect IPM use fewer uses of 
 two of the three major insecticides listed and adopters 
 of disease IPM use fewer applications of six of the 
 eight major fungus-killers. 
 The overall index of human (mammal) poisonous quality 
 (L TI) including both sudden and long-lasting effects is 
 also calculated for each of the 11 ingredients and 
 shown in Table 5. Also, a weighted average 
 poisonous quality index is calculated, where the weights are 
 based on the area treated, application rate, and number of applications. As it can be seen at the bottom 
 of Table 5, the average poisonous quality of the insecticides 
 used by adopters of insect IPM is (a) little lower 
 
 153 
 
 (LTI = 1.7) than that of nonadopters (LTI = 1.8); 
 both of these poisonous qualities are carefully thought about/believed as medium-level. 
 The poisonous quality of fungus-killers used is mostly the 
 same for adopters and nonadopters of IPM for sicknesses and in both cases the average poisonous quality of 
 fungus-killers is quite low (LTI = 0.35). However, the 
 fungus-killer results are strongly influenced by sulfur, 
 which has a large weight because it is intensively 
 used in grape production. Sulfur has a low (milk-producing animal) 
 poisonous quality (LTI = 0.33). 
 To examine (the health of the Earth/the surrounding conditions)al hit/effect of IPM we 
 use (the health of the Earth/the surrounding conditions)al hit/effect quotient (EIQ) (Kovach 
 et al., 1992). As pointed to/showed earlier, the EIQ measures 
 the hit/effect of each bug-killer active ingredient on 
 human health and the health of the Earth/the surrounding conditions. Table 5 provides 
 the EIQ values of the active ingredients used in 
 grape production. We also calculate an overall 
 weighted average EIQ for the major insecticides and 
 fungus-killers used. Weights are based on the area 
 treated, application rates, and number of applications 
 (Table 5). As seen at the bottom of Table 5, the 
 overall EIQ of insecticides decreases (a) little for 
 adopters of insect IPM (from 25.2 to 24.7) but the

 7. Ending/deciding comments 
 This paper presents a way(s) of doing things to calculate 
 the hit/effect of IPM on bug-killer use, poisonous quality and 
 other (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) (features/ qualities/ traits) of the bug-killers, 
 crop yields, and farm (money made/good things received). The way(s) of doing things is 
 applied to the case of grape producers in six states 
 accoonting f.or most 0f th(Euro) U.S. production. The 
 method is :gemenilil.ly applicabJe to technology adoption. It accounts for self-selectivity and (happening at the same time), 
 and the pes,ticide demllJld and yield equations are 
 theorett&amp;lt;;aiiy cqfisis\ertt with a restricted profit functioif 'Â·"''Â·' &#126;&#126; -Â·Â·Â· '"' 
 ,. 
 the results support the idea that, among grape 
 growers, adopters of IPM for insects and IPM for 
 sicknesses use significantly fewer insecticide and 
 fungus-killer applications than do nonadopters. Also, both average poisonous quality and (the health of the Earth/the surrounding conditions)al 
 hit/effect quotient decreases (a) little with adoption of 
 insect IPM, but they remain about the same for 
 adopters and nonadopters of IPM for sicknesses. The 
 effect of IPM adoption on produces and changeable (money made/good things received) 
 is positive but only significant for the case of IPM 
 for sicknesses, (in other words), the adoption of IPM for sicknesses 
 increases produces and (money made/good things received) significantly. Other important (things that decide other things) of bug-killer demand, besides 
 IPM adoption, are bug-killer prices, grape prices, pest 
 (situation where something is filled with lots of something harmful or disgusting) levels, type of grape, operator off-farm 
 work, and farm size. 
 Two limits of the study are the incomplete 
 modeling of the substitution possibilities between 
 bug-killers and other (bought something for money) inputs, especially 
 (material that makes plants grow better)s, and the (when something is kept out or not included) of production risk. In 
 the first case, the limits are (named after/discovered by/caused by) the 
 lack of price input data for some inputs. Panel data 
 would be needed to deal with the/to speak to the  second issue acceptably. When better data become available, these 
 limits will be got on top of/won helping improve our 
 understanding of technology adoption in farming.
