 Abstract 
 Previous scientific studies of multiple job holding have tended to focus on the (features/ qualities/ traits) of those getting off-fann employment 
 and the factors affecting the hours supplied to those getting off-farm activities. None of these studies have clearly talked to/looked at the reasons 
 behind the decision to look (for)  off-farm employment. Neither have they been able to examine in-depth the important issue of how this major 
 part of the farm part/area responds to alternative policies, since most studies have used thin sliceal data for a given area. A 
 comparison between countries would permit the analysis of how multiple job holding responds to different government policies. The 
 purpose of this paper is to examine the reasons for and factors affecting multiple job holdings of dairy farm families in close-by areas 
 of two counties, United States and Canada. The bordering areas of New York and Ontario have almost the same  (land-area-based/location) conditions but 
 very different farm support and social service policies. The results point to/show the importance of farm income on why people work off 
 the farm and provide (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) of multiple job holding as a flexible (machine/method/way) for dealing with changes in the money-based (surrounding conditions) facing 
 the household. For operators, the driving (features/ qualities/ traits) influencing off-farm labor participation is the farm's (money-related) position. The 
 supply-managed milk marketing system secures/makes sure of higher and more stable returns for Ontario dairy farm labor. In contrast, it is family 
 (information about people/combinations of different kinds of people), educational level and social support policy that appears to mostly influence (related to a husband or wife) off-farm employment decisions. Free 
 medical care in Ontario lowers the reservation wage for household members. The effect of these farm and social support policies on the 
 relative returns to labor in farming and non-farm employment explains the lower participation rate and hours supplied in off-farm work 
 by both operators, and hours supplied in off-farm work by both operators and (husband or wife)s in Ontario dairy farm household. Published by

 1. Introduction 
 Rising nonfarm wages and a greater increase in the supply of farming-based products relative to demand has 
 depressed farm earnings for some families in the nonfarm part/area over the last few 20 years. The resulting 
 (change to make better/related to changing something) of labor out of farming has happened through a large reduction in the number of farms, and also 
 through dual employment of those remaining on the farm (Huffman, 1991). Multiple job holding may be viewed

 as a (lasting for a short time) thing/event in response to (money-related) pressures in farming, but it has always been present 
 (Fuller, 1991). Over the last few years, almost 60% of US farm families had either the (husband or wife), operator, or both 
 employed in off-farm work and about 80% had higher cash incomes from off-farm earnings (including 
 wages, rent, interest etc.) than from their farm (USDA, 1992). 
 The reasons for examining multiple job holding are usually grouped into 3 issues (Carlin and Bentley, 
 1991). First are (related to workers in general) issues surrounding (wasting very little while working or producing something) and equity differences between those working 
 full-time on the farm and those with off-farm jobs. If the last thing just mentioned group are less productive, then understanding the 
 (features/ qualities/ traits) of those people would aid in targeting extension efforts to help improve their (wasting very little while working or producing something). 
 However, the need for such efforts and for other farm programs such as income support are brought into 
 question if total household income for multiple job holding farm families is just like those families without 
 off-farm jobs. Second are (away from cities) development issues that are related to the equity (things to carefully think about) just talked about/said. 
 If total family incomes are greater for families with off-farm jobs, then the richness of areas away from cities may be 
 improved more through efforts to increase non-farm employment opportunities than through direct income 
 support to farmers. Third are forecasts related to farm structure. The (popular thing/general way things are going) to a bi-modal distribution of farm 
 sizes is supported if multiple job holding people (who were part of a study, etc.) tend to be middle-(old/allowed to get old/got older). Such people are unlikely to 
 view off-farm work as a (lasting for a short time) phase in a change to full-time farming, but rather as a full-time occupation 
 with farming as a sideline activity. Operators whose major occupation is not farming almost only have 
 small farms (USDA, 1992). A bi-modal distribution has effects/results/suggestions for issues such as research (things that are important), (away from cities) 
 (set of machines), (money-related) servicess, and agri-food processing location decisions (Goddard et al., 1993). 
 Previous scientific studies of multiple job holding have tended to focus on the (features/ qualities/ traits) of those 
 getting off-farm employment and the factors affecting the hours supplied to those off-farm activities (e.g., 
 Bollman, 1979; Huffman, 1980; Sumner, 1982; Simpson and Kapitany, 1983; Gould and Saupe, 1989; Huffman 
 and Lange, 1989; Woman  et al., 1988; Woman  and Gempesaw, 1992; and Weersink, 1992). Focus has been on human 
 capital (features/ qualities/ traits) with the general finding that the increasing off-farm employment rate is due to changes in 
 not important returns to labor between off-farm and farm activities arising mostly from improved workers 
 skills. None of these studies have clearly talked to/looked at the reasons behind the decision to look (for)  off-farm 
 employment. Neither have they been able to examine in-depth the important issue of how this major part 
 of the farm part/area responds to alternative policies (Sumner, 1991), since most studies have used thin sliceal 
 data for a given area. A comparison between countries would permit the analysis of how multiple job holding 
 responds to different government policies. 
 The purpose of this paper is to examine the reasons for and factors affecting multiple job holdings of dairy 
 farm families in close-by areas of two counties, United States and Canada. The bordering areas of New 
 York and Ontario have almost the same  (land-area-based/location) conditions but very different farm support and social service 
 policies. Milk production in Ontario is controlled through a supply management system that enables producers 
 in that area of control/area of land to earn higher and more stable returns than their partners in New York for whom milk 
 prices are subject to a greater degree of market forces. Families in Ontario also benefit from free access to 
 medical care but pay higher taxes. The lack of such coverage for families in New York can be a reason for a 
 member of a farm household to look (for)  off-farm employment in order to get fringe benefits such as medical 
 insurance (Jensen and Salant, 1985, Alwang and Stallmann, 1992). The different forms of government 
 support in the two areas and the focus on dairy, which needs/demands more labor loyalty to/promise to the farm than other 
 farming-based products, should permit ideas of how off-farm labor decisions are affected by government 
 policy. 
 The paper begins with a possible model of multiple job holding decisions by farm families followed by the 
 econometric means of guessing the model that accounts for joint decision-making and self-selection biases. 
 Section 2 of the paper examines differences between the two areas in the extent of multiple job holdings and 
 its explanatory (numbers that change/things that change) along with a discussion of how policy has added/has given to these differences. We then 
 carefully study (wasting very little while working or producing something) and equity measures for different work governments and factors affecting the decision to 
 participate in off-farm work. First (or most important) reasons for multiple job holdings given by the household and their

 relationship to farm income are then examined. Finally, factors affecting both demand and supply for off-farm 
 labor are discussed. Differences in off-farm employment patterns between New York and Ontario as partial 
 indicators of how different government policies affect multiple job holding decisions by dairy farm families 
 are focused on. 
 
 2. Possible model 
 The decision to work off-farm by operators and (husband or wife)s can be viewed through an farming-based household 
 model that combines farming-based production, consumption and labor supply decisions into a single (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built). 
 Almost the same  models have been used by Huffman and Lange (1989), Gould and Saupe (1989), and Woman  and 
 Gempesaw (1992). In these models, the household is assumed to (make as big as possible) utility by using/eating different 
 valuable things that it produces by combining market products (that are bought and sold)  and time. Household utility is assumed to be received/made from 
 from consumption of all products (that are bought and sold) (G) and fun time for the operator (L0 ) and (husband or wife) (L8 ). The level of utility 
 came/coming from (bought something for money) products (that are bought and sold)  and fun is affected by (coming from the outside of something) (numbers that change/things that change) such as workers (features/ qualities/ traits) of the operator (H 0 ) and (husband or wife) (H 8 ) along with other household and area (features/ qualities/ traits) such as number 
 and age distribution of children and service availability (ZH). 
 
 ( 1) 
 Utility is (made as big as possible) subject to restrictions on time, income and farm working well. Time for the operator and 
 (husband or wife) are assumed to be blended. Each set apart their total time gift (T) to either fun (L) or 
 work which consists of time spent working on the farm (F) and possibly in off-farm employment (M). It is 
 assumed that a positive amount of time is set apart and given out to fun and farm work, but that hours of off-farm work 
 may be zero for either the operator or (husband or wife). 
 
 (2) 
 Working on or off the farm is done to create income for (instance of buying something for money) of consumption products (that are bought and sold)  bought at a price 
 Pa. Total amount spent on products (that are bought and sold)  for direct or indirect consumption is limited by the amount earned from farm 
 
 income, off-farm income and other (coming from the outside of something) household income (V). Assuming the household faces perfectly 
 competitive output and input markets, farm income (PQQ- RX) is equal to the price of farm output (PQ) 
 multiplied by amount produced (Q) less (number or thing that changes) costs of production RX where R is the input price vector, and 
 X is the amount of (bought) farm inputs. Off-farm income is the product of the wage rate (W) and the hours 
 worked off-farm by both the operator and (husband or wife) (W 0 M 0 + W 8 M 8 ). The budget restriction on household 
 income is therefore 
 
 (3) 
 The wage rates facing operators and (husband or wife)s are assumed to depend on their (pertaining to each person or thing) workers 
 (features/ qualities/ traits) (H) and local labor market conditions (ZM). 
 
 (4) 
 While off-farm wage rates are assumed to be independent of the hours worked, not important returns to farm 
 labor by the operator and (husband or wife) are assumed to reduce with increases in hours of farm work. The production 
 function therefore orders/forces an added/more restriction on utility (biggest increase/best possible extent) by the household. Farm production 
 technology is represented by

 where j(.) is a strictly curved production function and ZF is a vector of (coming from the outside of something) farm specific 
 (features/ qualities/ traits). Workers (features/ qualities/ traits) are included in the production function to account for the increased 
 (wasting very little while working or producing something) assumed to be related to factors such as years of formal education and prior farming experience. 
 The household (makes as big as possible) utility (1) subject to its time (2), budget (3) and farm working well (5) restrictions 
 through its choice of consumption products (that are bought and sold)  (bought something for money), amount of farm inputs (bought something for money), and the work hours of 
 the operator and (husband or wife) gave out to farm and off-farm employment. Best levels of these choice (numbers that change/things that change) 
 can be figured out by/decided by (at the same time) solving the first-order conditions (see Huffman, 1991). An interior 
 solution is assumed for all choice (numbers that change/things that change) with the exception of off-farm work by both the operator and 
 (husband or wife). Best hours of off-farm work are zero if the not important return to off-farm labor or wage rate (W) is 
 less than the not important value of farm labor tested at the point of best time portion between farm work 
 and fun and with no off-farm work. The not important value of farm labor is the product of farm output price 
 (PQ) and the not important product of farm labor (JF(.)). If, at this point, not important returns to off-farm labor are 
 greater than farm work, the individual will increase off-farm work hours, by that/in that way increasing the not important value 
 of farm labor until the not important returns to both forms of employment are equaled the tax rate of 
 substitution between fun and consumption products (that are bought and sold) (W = PQJF(.) = UL/ U0 ). 
 Given the idea (you think is true) that the farm household is a price taker in output and input markets, the household 
 model is recursive if an interior solution exists for all choice (numbers that change/things that change). Decisions on farm labor and (bought something for money) 
 inputs are first made, and then consumption decisions on (bought) products (that are bought and sold)  and fun. Off-farm labor supply 
 functions are received/made from leftover/extraly from the time restriction and will contain all (coming from the outside of something) (numbers that change/things that change) in the 
 held back optimization problem. 
 
 (6) 
 However, if best hours of off-farm work are zero for either the operator or (husband or wife), household decisions 
 (related to/looking at/thinking about) farm production and consumption decisions must be made both/together, rather than recursively. Off-farm 
 labor supply is still decided/figured out leftover/extraly as function of the same (numbers that change/things that change) in Eq. (6), except that the 
 unobservable wage rate for an individual not working off-farm is not a (thing that decides something) of the hours worked 
 off-farm by the other partner. However, the supply function for this partner is (may or may not happen, depending on something) upon the participation 
 decision by the partner without off-farm employment. 
 
 3. Econometric model 
 The approach for guessing the model of multiple job holdings just presented is based on Huffman and 
 Lange (1989) and involves guessing the demand for off-farm labor and the supply of this labor by both the 
 operator and the (husband or wife). These decisions on off-farm employment for both members are made both/together by the 
 household and can result in four possible pictures/situations: (1) both operator and (husband or wife) work off-farm (M 0 &amp;gt; 0, 
 Ms &amp;gt; 0); (2) only the operator works off-farm (M 0 &amp;gt; 0, Ms = 0); only the (husband or wife) has off-farm employment 
 (M 0 = 0, Ms &amp;gt; 0); and (4) neither partner works off-farm (M 0 = 0, Ms = 0). These four governments, which will 
 be represented by the subscript j later, have been (match up each pair of items in order) classified as: dual career, traditional part-time, dual 
 career part-time, and traditional (Deseran et al., 1984). 
 The off-farm labor demand equations for the operator and (husband or wife) are: 
 
 (7) 
 where f3 are unknown limits/guidelines and v is an error term. As noted in Eq. (4), the wage rate (W) is assumed to 
 depend on workers (features/ qualities/ traits) (H) and local labor market conditions (ZM). The wage rate is watched/followed 
 only when the decision is made to work off the farm, which will happen when the wage rate is greater than the 
 reservation wage (WR). The reservation wage is the not important value of farm labor, assuming no off-farm work 
 
 A. Weersink et al.j Farming-based Money flow 18 (1998) 127-143 
 
 131 
 
 (M; = 0) and tested at the point of best portion of time between farm work and fun. So, the 
 reservation wage depends on non-wage and non-price (numbers that change/things that change) (coming from the outside of something) to the household's consumption 
 (ZH ), production (ZF) and labor supply (ZM) decisions as represented by Z. 
 The supply of off-farm labor depends on the (coming from the outside of something) (numbers that change/things that change) Z and the wage rates as shown in Eq. (6). 
 However, the unobservable wage rate for an individual working only on the farm is not a (thing that decides something) of the 
 hours worked off-farm by the other partner. The off-farm labor supply functions, Mj for individual i under 
 
 off-farm employment picture/situation j can be expressed as;m

 where a are unknown limits/guidelines and f.L are error terms. 
 Sample selection bias is a possible problem in guessing either off-farm labor demand (Eq. (7)) or supply 
 (Eqs. (8) and (9)) equations due to the possibility of zero hours worked by some people. To correct for such 
 bias, the decision to get off-farm employment must be modeled. The chances of off-farm work for the 
 operator (Pr(O)) and (husband or wife) (Pr(S)) can be represented as (Gould and Saupe, 1989); 
 Pr(O) = Pr(W 0 &amp;gt; W 0 R) = Pr(W 0 &amp;gt; W 0 Riws &amp;lt; wsR) 
 
 + Pr(W 0 &amp;gt; W 0 Riws;;::: wsR) = Pr( So&amp;gt; Bo)

 + azo aooZ 
 + azsassZ 
 
 The chance of working off-farm represented by Eqs. (10) and (11) for the operator and (husband or wife), (match up each pair of items in order), 
 is equal to the chance of the wage rate being greater than the reservation wage. This chance can be 
 rotten into two (may or may not happen, depending on something) chances depending on the size of their partner's off-farm earning rate and 
 reservation wage, and in turn the chance of their partner working on or off the farm. Such combined participation 
 decisions can be guessed with a bivariate probit model. 
 The connected nature of the wage and hours worked equations hints that the (may or may not happen, depending on something) means of the 
 disturbance terms in these equations are unlikely to be zero. The biases can be corrected by creating new 
 (numbers that change/things that change) from the bivariate probit equations that are (may or may not happen, depending on something) means of the disturbance terms and substituting 
 them into the demand and supply equations (Amemiya, 1974; Fishe et al., 1981; Gould and Saupe, 1989; 
 Huffman and Lange, 1989). For example, the off-farm labor demand Eq. (7) is changed to the following: 
 
 (7') 
 
 A. Weersink et al.j Farming-based Money flow 18 (1998) 127-143 
 
 132 
 
 where A1 and A2 are the sample correction factors guessed from the bivariate probit equations for the 
 operator and (husband or wife), (match up each pair of items in order), and cp is the error term. 
 (in almost the same way), the (may or may not happen, depending on something) expectations of the error terms in the labor supply Eqs. (8) and (9) may also not be 
 zero. Operator and (husband or wife) selectivity changes/recalculations calculated from the bivariate probit model of the participation 
 decision must then be added to account for the nonzero expectations. The following are the resulting four 
 absolute/without any limits labor supply equations connected with the three pictures/situations under which one of the household 
 members are working off-farm:

 where the random error terms, ljJ, now have the desired zero expectations. 
 
 4. Data 
 Data used in the analysis were gotten from a May 1991 survey of dairy farm families in four nearby areas 
 in New York and Ontario, with two areas in each state/province. A random sample of 500 dairy farms from 
 northern and western counties in New York was given by the New York Farming-based Statistics Service. The 
 Ontario sample was drawn for two areas (related to scientific farming)ally almost the same as  the two in New York. One consisted of five 
 counties in eastern Ontario across the St. Lawerence River from the northern New York area and the other 
 consisted of three counties in southwestern Ontario due west of the western New York area. Southwestern 
 Ontario and western New York tend to have more productive farmland and more good (related to the Earth's weather) conditions, 
 and so a more (many different kinds of people or things) farming-based part/area than the other two areas. A random sample of 220 producers from 
 eastern Ontario and 304 from southwestern Ontario was created from the Ontario Milk Marketing Board's 
 computerized information file. Overall response rate was 29.4% for New York and 40.9% for Ontario. Although 
 response rates were (compared to other things) low due to the spring timing of the survey, sample biases were not thought of as a 
 problem based on a comparison of person who responded (features/ qualities/ traits) such as farm size, working well and operator age to 
 those from other published sources (authors). 
 The demand and supply of off-farm labor are influenced by four general categories of (numbers that change/things that change); household or 
 family (features/ qualities/ traits) (ZH), workers (features/ qualities/ traits) (H), farm (features/ qualities/ traits) (Zp) and local labor market 
 condition (ZM). Means, standard mistakes and the units of measurement for the explanatory (numbers that change/things that change) are 
 given by area in Table 1 and under the four possible work governments (j) in Table 2. 
 Family (features/ qualities/ traits) include the number of children in different age categories and the level of happiness 
 the family has with farm life. The effect of children on off-farm employment decisions was measured by the 
 number of children in each of three different age categories (less than 6, between 6-ll, and between 12-18). 
 Increases in the number of preschool age children is guessed to decrease the chance of off-farm 
 employment especially for (husband or wife)s. In contrast, time demands may decrease and expenses increase for older 
 children, suggesting a greater chance of the operator or (husband or wife) looking (for) employment outside the farm. Dairy 
 farm families in each area were asked about their level of happiness using a Likert scale with 1 being very 
 made happy and 5 representing very dissatisfied. The more content people are with their situation on the farm, 
 the less likely they are to desire off-farm employment. 
 Workers (features/ qualities/ traits) include age, education and farm experience. The effect of age on off-farm 
 employment is confusing, since both farm and off-farm labor working well are assumed to increase with

 experience as measured by age. To account for possible life cycle produces, age is also included in quadratic form. 
 As with age, education has a almost the same  good  confusing effect on off-farm labor supply. However, most 
 previous studies have found education to have a larger effect on market earnings than on the not important value of 
 farm labor, by that/in that way increasing the chance of participation and off-farm employment hours. Education is 
 measured through seven categories for the highest level of education received/got, ranging from some grade school 
 to college graduate. 
 Farm (features/ qualities/ traits) will influence the value of farm labor working well. Farm labor (F) along with (bought) 
 inputs X decides/figures out farm output Q. Since the level of farm inputs and off-farm labor hours are serious and stubborn 
 (at the same time), farm output cannot be included in the guess off-farm participation and supply equations 
 unless it is guessed and the (described the future) values incorporated (Huffman, 1980). Although off-farm employment 
 decisions are made (at the same time) with the portion of farm inputs, some inputs can be assumed to be fixed 
 for farms in a single thin slice (Gould and Saupe, 1989). Fixed factors thought about/believed in this study were the 
 number of good areas of land and herd size. It is guessed that increases in these size (numbers that change/things that change) will increase 
 not important returns to farm labor and in that way decrease the chance of off-farm work and hours of such work 
 supplied. Added/more farm (features/ qualities/ traits) focused on the firm's (money-related) position. Decreases in net farm income 
 may cause the need for off-farm income to meet a desired level of total household income. The need for 
 off-farm employment may also increase with the level of (money-related) responsibilities which was measured by the 
 debt-to-valuable thing ratio (Simpson and Kapitany, 1983). 
 Local labor market conditions influence the availability of off-farm employment and wage rate. Access to 
 employment opportunities was measured by distance to the nearest town providing emergency medical services. 
 A binary (number or thing that changes) for state or area of control/area of land (New York or Ontario) in which the farm was located was also included 
 to (take control of) differences in labor market conditions and in policies between the two countries that may affect 
 off-farm employment decisions not (taken/took control of) by previous (numbers that change/things that change). It is guessed that families in New 
 York are more likely to look (for)  work off the farm due to the lower degree of farm and social support from the 
 government that by that/in that way lowers the not important value product to labor on the farm. Also, a (related to a large area) binary 
 (number or thing that changes) was also included (eastjnorth or western). Increased employment opportunities and so higher wages 
 are assumed to exist in the more populated western areas of both areas.

 5. Results 
 5.1. (related to a large area) differences in explanatory (numbers that change/things that change) 
 Econometric results of the participation, demand and supply of off-farm labor are presented after an initial 
 analysis of differences in the (numbers that change/things that change) affecting off-farm labor activity between areas, which are mostly due 
 to different social and farm policy governments. In terms of family, workers and location (features/ qualities/ traits), 
 New York and Ontario dairy families are almost the same (see Table 1). An (very big/very strong) number of the operators 
 are married with an average age in the mid to late 40s. Ontario families tend to be (a) little younger and a bit 
 larger with about one-third having three or more children living at home, instead of less than one-quarter of 
 New York families. The percentage of Ontario producers who left school before completing high school is more 
 than double that of New York, although a almost the same  percentage in both areas received (after high school) education. 
 Women involved in the survey are more highly educated than the men (without any concern about/having nothing to do with) area. 
 Farm (features/ qualities/ traits) represent the major difference between surveyed families. New York producers on 
 average milk nearly twice as many cows (81) as their Ontario peers (47), and the New York take from herds, in 
 general, are much larger. Nearly 75% of Ontario producers milk fewer than 51 cows, while less than half of the 
 New Yorkers milk a almost the same  number. Only 4% of Ontario dairies are 100-plus groups, whereas over 20% of New 
 York groups are of that size. Milk production per cow is also higher in New York by an average of 15%. (even though there is the existence of) 
 producing less milk, the average Ontario producer's net farm income is about 60% (US$10,000) higher 
 
 136 
 
 A. Weersink et al.j Farming-based Money flow 18 (1998) 127-143 
 
 than that (understood/made real/achieved) by the average operator in New York. Over 38% of New York farms had negative farm 
 income in 1990 (a time of (compared to other things) low US milk prices) while only 14% of Ontario farms did. Not only are 
 farm incomes higher in Ontario but they are also more (branched out/done different things) with non-milk sales about 3 times 
 higher than for New York dairies. Ontarians also have lower debt-to-valuable thing ratios (0.26 vs. 0.39). Over 65% of 
 the Ontario dairies have positive net farm incomes and debt-to-valuable thing ratios less than 0.40, whereas only 31% of 
 the New York farms are in such a good (money-related) condition. Differences in farm (money-related) position are 
 reflected in differences in happiness expressed by producers toward dairy farming. 
 (related to a large area) differences/different versions in these factors influencing off-farm employment are due to different policy governments. 
 The supply-managed marketing system for milk in Ontario secures/makes sure of operators a fair return calculated on the basis 
 of a cost of production formula. In 1991, the system created receipts per unit of milk sold that were 20% 
 higher in Ontario than New York and as a result mostly explains the above noted (related to a large area) differences in net 
 farm income. Because this system has been in place since the late 1960s, the difference in farm support policy 
 also explains the stronger valuable thing and equity position for producers in Ontario. The stronger (money-related) position 
 enjoyed by Ontario dairy families as a result of their marketing system reduces the need for off-farm income 
 relative to their partners in New York. The need for off-farm earnings is reduced further in Ontario by the 
 investment levels needed/demanded to expand production. Higher non-milk sales for Ontario dairy farms as compared to 
 those in New York is likely due to quota costs. The resulting greater (getting involved with different types of things; not sticking with only one thing) of income sources reduces 
 the need for off-farm employment to serve as self-insurance device. Greater government support for social 
 services in Ontario, especially for medical care, may explain the larger dairy farm families noted above in 
 Ontario as the costs for caring for such as family are reduced. The presence of young children has been 
 guessed earlier to reduce the (quality of something that makes people like it or want it) of off-farm work. So, government policy has served to decrease 
 the reservation wage while increasing the not important returns to farm work, and in that way decreased the chance of 
 off-farm employment by Ontario dairy families as compared to those in New York. 
 5.2. Work portion 
 The (related to a large area) differences in factors affecting off-farm employment due to differences in policy government are 
 carried out as more of the New York farms (47%) than the Ontario farm (36%) had either a (husband or wife), an operator 
 or both employed off-farm (Table 1). In all areas, the most common situation for those families having 
 someone working off-farm was for the (husband or wife) to be the only individual with off-farm employment (49 in New 
 York, 33% of people who responded; 65 in Ontario, 27% of people who responded). The small number of operators with outside jobs 
 and the lower off-farm employment rate as compared to the national average (60% in the US) reflects the time 
 commitment needed/demanded to manage a dairy farm relative to other farm businesses/projects. 
 In general, few differences existed between average hours worked off-farm by operators and (husband or wife)s in New 
 York and Ontario. Operators in the eastern areas with off-farm jobs spent an average of 10 h less than their 
 (husband or wife)s spend in their outside jobs, while there was little difference between operator and (related to a husband or wife) off-farm 
 hours in the western areas. Total farm and off-farm labor hours were greater for operators with off-farm 
 employment than those without. There were few (related to a large area) differences in the average hours worked off-farm by 
 operators. However, New York (husband or wife)s averaged about 5 more off-farm hours per week of employment than 
 Ontario (husband or wife)s. 
 5.3. Off-farm work participation 
 The chance of off-farm employment was guessed using a bivariate probit model (Eqs. (10) and (11)) 
 that accounted for the combined participation of the operator and (husband or wife) in making this decision. The relationship-related 
 coefficient of the error term was positive, but not very different than zero at the 5% level of 
 importance. So, two univariate probit guesses were the appropriate guesses rather than a bivariate

 probit model. However, the sign and high levels of the coefficients from the univariate probit models as 
 reported in Table 3 were agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with those created by the bivariate probit model. 
 Family (features/ qualities/ traits) had more of an influence on the chance of the (husband or wife) working off the farm than 
 the operator. The number of small children reduces the chance of the (husband or wife) looking (for) off-farm employment, 
 reflecting higher opportunity costs of home production and work time with young children (Long and Jones, 
 1980). The number of older children able to assume domestic responsibilities decreases the (related to a husband or wife) reservation 
 wage and (after that) increases the chance of off-farm employment. The result related to family (information about people/combinations of different kinds of people) are agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with explanation and many prior scientific studies (Alwang and Stallmann, 1992; Gould and 
 Saupe, 1989; Huffman and Lange, 1989; Woman  and Gempesaw, 1992). In contrast, the number and age 
 distribution of children does not generally have a significant effect on the participation decision for operators, 
 suggesting that children have little influence on the operator's reservation wage. Higher happiness with farm 
 life also reduces the chance of the (husband or wife) working off-farm. The greater the utility connected with 
 farming, the higher the reservation wage needed/demanded for the (husband or wife) to look (for)  employment away from the farm. 
 Although unhappiness with farm living is an driving force for off-farm employment by the (husband or wife), it had the opposite 
 (but unimportant) effect on the chance of working off-farm for the operator. 
 Workers (features/ qualities/ traits) played a big part in the off-farm employment decisions of the dairy farm 
 families sampled, especially for (husband or wife)s. A curved life-cycle pattern was found for operators. Age has a 
 
 138 
 
 A. Weersink et al.j Farming-based Money flow 18 (1998) 127-143 
 
 good effect on off-farm labor participation until 39 years after which the chance of participation 
 declines. The effect is agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with the findings of Sumner (1982) and Weersink (1992) for operators only 
 and of Woman  and Gempesaw (1992) and Gould and Saupe (1989) for operators making combined decisions. In 
 contrast, the chance of off-farm employment for (husband or wife)s was found to decrease with age. (related to a husband or wife) 
 participation appears to be mostly driven by the level of education. People with less than a high school 
 degree are much less likely to work off-farm than those with such a degree. The opposite happens for 
 (husband or wife)s with some post secondary education. The result is likely connected with the increase in off-farm 
 employment earning abilities connected with more education. More education could also change attitudes 
 (related to/looking at/thinking about) the relative attractiveness with off-farm work and in that way the reservation wage. In contrast to this 
 study's results for the (husband or wife) and for a majority of previous studies on operator participation, education does not 
 appear to affect the chance of off-farm work for operators. So, schooling has an unknown hit/effect on 
 the ratio of market earnings to the not important value of farm labor. 
 Farm (features/ qualities/ traits) were found to have little influence on the chance of off-farm employment with the 
 exception of the farm's (money-related) position for the operator. As expected, increases in the fixed factors of good 
 areas of land and number of milk cows reduce the chance of working off-farm, since the not important working well of 
 farm labor increases with farm size for a given wage rate. However, the results are unimportant for both 
 operator and (husband or wife). Increases in (money-related) pressures as measured by decreases in net farm income or increases 
 in the debt-to-valuable thing ratio also reduce the chance of off-farm employment. These (numbers that change/things that change) had a significant 
 effect in the operator's decision but not for the (husband or wife). Differences in farm policy between Ontario and New 
 York are reflected in the (related to a large area) values for these farm (features/ qualities/ traits). The supply management system in 
 Ontario has resulted in farms with fewer cows than those in New York, but with higher net farm income and 
 lower debt-to-valuable thing ratios. As a result, differences in farm policy have an indirect influence on the chance of 
 off-farm employment. 
 Country did not produce operator off-farm labor participation. The result may be due to including 
 farm support policy (things to carefully think about) within the farm (typical and expected) (numbers that change/things that change) discussed above. Differences in 
 social policy between New York and Ontario have not been (taken/took by force)/(taken/took control of) by previous explanatory (numbers that change/things that change). As a 
 result, the dummy (number or thing that changes) for the country in which the farm is located can account for any difference. The 
 finding that (husband or wife)s in New York were much more likely to work off-farm than their partners in 
 Ontario is agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with this guess. The lack of free medical care and so the need for insurance raises 
 the relative value of earnings from off-farm employment that often include medical benefit packages. (related to a large area) 
 location did not significantly influence off-farm participation rates. The other location (number or thing that changes), distance to a 
 major centre, was found to lower the chance of off-farm employment. This was expected given that an 
 increase in travel cost will increase the reservation wage; however, the coefficient was unimportant for both 
 operator and (husband or wife). 
 5.4. Reasons for off-farm employment 
 Although the previous analysis provides an understanding of the factors affecting the decision to work off the 
 farm, a (like nothing else) aspect of the survey test/list of questions in this study is that families were asked directly for the major 
 reason why a member(s) worked off the farm. Maintaining the dairy farm business was the most often referred to 
 reason for off-farm employment of operators in both New York and Ontario (Fig. 1), which is agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with 
 the econometric findings just discussed (Table 3). However, nearly half (45%) of the operators in New York 
 working off-farm said they needed that income to maintain the dairy farm business, while less than one-third 
 (29%) of the Ontario operators did so for the same reason. Over 14% of New York operators working off-farm 
 did so for the fringe benefits (often medical insurance). Under the (converted to government ownership/made nation-wide) health care system in Ontario, 
 none of the operators working off-farm did so to get fringe benefits. None of the New York operators said 
 they work at off-farm employment to make contact with other people, whereas 18% of the Ontario operators 
 pointed to/showed this was their main reason for working off-farm. Although the same percentage of New York and

 Fig. 1. First (or most important) reason for off-farm employment by operator and (husband or wife)(% of people who responded). 
 
 Ontario operators worked off-farm to maintain family income, a much smaller share of New York producers 
 work to add to family income or increase income (firm and steady nature/lasting nature/strength). So, it appears that off-farm employment by 
 operators is far more important for the basic needs of New York farm business and families than for those in 
 Ontario. 
 (husband or wife)s of the farm operators expressed more flexibility about their choices to work off-farm. Still, the two 
 most important reasons given by New York (husband or wife)s for having off-farm jobs were to help maintain either the 
 farm business (23%) or a minimum family income (25%). Ontario farms were not only less dependent on 
 off-farm income created by the operator to maintain the farm or family income, but also on off-farm income 
 created by the (husband or wife). Only 5% of Ontario (husband or wife)s worked off-farm to help maintain the farm and 15% to 
 help maintain family income. The two most important reasons referred to by Ontario (husband or wife)s for working off-farm 
 were to add to family income (18%) and increase income (firm and steady nature/lasting nature/strength) (16%). 
 In order to better understand the relationship between farm income and the reasons why people look (for)  off-farm 
 employment, the eight reasons asked of/presented to  the household (as shown in Fig. 1) were grouped into three categories; 
 (1) to get needs; (2) to improve living standards; and (3) reasons not related to money. Needs 
 groups maintaining either the farm business or family income. Increasing or (making steady/making firm and strong) family income along 
 with fringe benefits are carefully thought about/believed ways to improve living standards, whereas contact with other people, 
 farming not first (or most important) business and 'other' are carefully thought about/believed reasons unrelated to income. The percentage of 
 people who responded within each of the three categories of reasons was plotted against four farm income classes in Fig. 
 2. 
 The level of farm income affects why people work off-farm except when the benefit came/coming from off-farm 
 employment is unrelated to income. For farms showing net losses, 70% of the operators in New York and 50% 
 of those in Ontario worked off-farm to (accomplish or gain with effort) basic needs. Almost the same  percentages referring to this reason were 
 found in the US$0-US$19,999 income category. At the other end of the income scale, none of the operators 
 with farm incomes greater than US$40,000 in either area worked off the farm to pay for basic needs. The 
 importance of (accomplishing or gaining) needs also (lowered in number/got worse/gotten worse) with income levels for (husband or wife)s in both areas, but the reasons 
 tend to be more evenly distributed among the four net farm income categories.

 Fig. 2. First (or most important) reason for off-farm employment for operator and (husband or wife) by income class. 
 
 The results especially for the operators lend support to the view of multiple job holding as a flexible 
 (machine/method/way) to (change to make better/change to fit new conditions) to changes in the money-based (surrounding conditions) facing the household. In the case of not enough 
 farm returns, off-farm earnings provide for minimum survival/income levels. Once those are (accomplished or gained), such earnings 
 provide the opportunity to raise living standards and protect against downturns in farm income below levels 
 necessary to (accomplish or gain with effort) basic needs. In fact, Barlett (1991) watched/followed that the first (or most important) reason for a sample of 
 Kansas farmers worked off-farm was the doubt connected with farm income. Wealth effects appear 
 obvious in high income levels, where reasons other than income decide/figure out the first (or most important) reason for off-farm 
 employment. So, multiple job holding is a self-insurance activity that can reduce the effect of farm 
 income downturns in the same way that credit and insurance markets can help smooth consumption. 
 5.5. Off-farm labor demand 
 
 An off-farm labor demand equation with sample selection correction factors incorporated from the binomial 
 probit model was guessed using ordinary least squares for all (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) reporting a market wage. The wage 
 offer equation (Table 3) was guessed for the (husband or wife) only due to the small number of dairy farm operators 
 
 141

 working off the farm. Off-farm wage rate for the (husband or wife) was found to increase with age until 55 years and then 
 decrease. The curved profile, although (related to numbers) unimportant, is agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with the (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) life cycle 
 patterns found by previous studies (Alwang and Stallmann, 1992; Gould and Saupe, 1989; and Huffman and 
 Lange, 1989). Those people with at least some post secondary education were found to earn significantly 
 more than other dairy farm (husband or wife)s working off-farm. This was the only significant (number or thing that changes) in the labor demand 
 equation. Although wages tended to be higher in Ontario than New York, the effect of the (related to a large area) dummy 
 (number or thing that changes) was unimportant. 
 5. 6. Off-farm labor supply equation 
 
 The previous sections examined the (features/ qualities/ traits) of those participating in off-farm employment and the 
 first (or most important) reason for that decision. We now move to examine the factors affecting the number of hours worked off 
 the farm. As with the wage demand equation, off-farm labor supply (Eqs. (12)-(15)) was guessed in two 
 stages. Wage rates were (described the future) from guesses of the labor demand equation in Table 3, and sample selection 
 correction factors were created from guesses of the chance of participation in Table 3. Resulting 
 guesses are reported in Table 4. This equation also was guessed only for the families in which the (husband or wife) 
 alone had off-farm employment (Eq. (14)). 
 Two major factors influenced the number of off-farm hours supplied by (husband or wife)s in farm families. 
 Off-farm wage rates were found to have a significant positive influence on the amount of labor supplied by 
 (husband or wife)s in the sample. The results is agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with explanation, although a negative effect was gotten by Huffman<p><strong>NOTE: This document is incomplete.
