 Abstract 
 This paper adds/gives to the working well books in developing country farming by numbering the level of 
 (wasting very little while working or producing something) for a sample of poor (person) farmers from Eastern Paraguay. A (random/including random data points) (wasting very little while working or producing something) rotting way(s) of doing things is used to get technical, allocative and money-based (wasting very little while working or producing something) measures separately for cotton and cassava. An 
 average money-based (wasting very little while working or producing something) of 40.1% for cotton and of 52.3% for cassava is found, which suggests (large/relatively large) 
 room for working well gains for the farms in the sample through better use of available useful things/valuable supplies given the state of 
 technology. Gains in output through working well growth have become more and more important to Paraguay as the 
 opportunities to bring added/more virgin lands into (producing crops/helping something grow) have significantly reduced over the last few years. No clear 
 plan to improve farm working well could be gathered from an examination of the relationship between (wasting very little while working or producing something) 
 and different (how money affects people's lives) (numbers that change/things that change). One possible explanation for this finding is the existence of a stage of 
 development dividing line below which there is no consistent relationship between (how money affects people's lives) (numbers that change/things that change) and 
 working well. If this is the case, then our results suggest that this sample of Paraguayan poor people are yet to reach such 
 a dividing line. Because of this, improvements in educational and extension services, for example, would be needed to go beyond 
 this dividing line. Once this is good, added/more working well gains would be gotten by further investments in 
 workers and related factors.

 prise, therefore, that a lot of work has been 
 gave/reserved to the analysis of farm level (wasting very little while working or producing something) in 
 developing countries. An hidden (under) reason behind much of this work is that if farmers are not 
 making (producing a lot with very little waste) use of existing technology, then 
 efforts designed to improve (wasting very little while working or producing something) would be 
 more (producing a lot for a given amount of money) than introducing new technologies as a means of increasing farming-based 
 output (Belbase and Grabowski, 1985; Shapiro, 
 1983). 
 Most of the scientific books dealing with 
 farm (wasting very little while working or producing something) in developing countries has been 
 concerned only with the measurement of 
 technical (wasting very little while working or producing something). Studies of this type have 
 been published for India, The Philippines, Sri 
 Skinnya, Nepal, Malaysia, Tanzania, Jamaica, 
 Guatemala, and Brazil (Huang and Bagi, 1984; 
 Kalirajan and Shand, 1985; Kalirajan, 1981, 1984; 
 Lingard, Castillo and Jayasuriya, 1983; Kalirajan 
 and Flinn, 1983; Ekayanake, 1987; Kalirajan and 
 Shand, 1986; Shapiro and Muller, 1977; Rawlins, 
 1985; Phillips and Marble, 1986; Taylor and 
 Shonkwiler, 1986). By focusing only on technical 
 (wasting very little while working or producing something), these works have ignored the gains in 
 output that could be gotten in the short run by 
 also improving allocative (wasting very little while working or producing something). 
 There are only a few studies that go beyond 
 the measurement of technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) in developing country farming. These include the work 
 by Taylor, Drummond and Gomes (1986), who 
 carefully studied technical and money-based (wasting very little while working or producing something) for a 
 sample of Brazilian farmers; Bailey et al. (1989), 
 who measured technical, allocative and scale inefficiency for a sample of Ecuadorean milk producers; and Ali and Chaudry (1990), who examined technical, allocative and money-based (wasting very little while working or producing something) 
 for a sample of Pakistani crop farmers. 
 The purpose of this paper is to add/give to 
 the (wasting very little while working or producing something) books in developing country 
 farming by numbering the level of technical, 
 allocative and money-based (wasting very little while working or producing something) for a sample of 
 poor (person) farmers from Eastern Paraguay. The relationship between (wasting very little while working or producing something) and different (how money affects people's lives) (features/ qualities/ traits) of the poor people is also 
 (examined something closely). The rest of this paper is organized into five sections. First, we present a brief 
 background of the Paraguayan farming-based part/area, 
 followed by the (related to careful studying or deep thinking) (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) employed in 
 
 this study. The data and scientific model are 
 discussed next, followed by a section containing 
 the results and analysis. The last section offers 
 some ending/deciding statements. 
 
 2. Background 
 
 The farming-based part/area in Paraguay, as is often 
 the case in less developed nations, has played a 
 key role in this country's development plan. 
 An important part of this plan was the 
 availability of public lands which were distributed 
 to settlers as a means of both soaking up a growing 
 population and of increasing farming-based output 
 (Nagel, 1991). These settlements, along with huge traveling to Argentina during the 1950s and 
 1960s, delayed the process of (away from cities) to city-based  traveling and (reduced/ slowed/ slowly moved) the need for improving farming-based working well (Nikiphoroff and Villagra, 
 1987). 
 In the late 1960s and through the 1970s, 
 Paraguay experienced fast money-based growth resulting in part from good international valuable thing prices and, more importantly, from cash 
 inflows coming from/caused by the huge hydro-electric 
 project in Itaipu (Evenson, 1988). According to 
 the World Bank, the average once-a-year rate of 
 growth in Paraguayan farming during the 
 1965-80 period was a healthy 4.9%. By the late 
 1970s, however, the availability of public lands for 
 farming-based use had reduced much, and 
 the huge useful things/valuable supplies created during the construction of the Itaipu project did not provide a 
 lasting solution to the rising levels of unemployment and poorness (Nikiphoroff and Villagra, 
 1987). 
 In the early 1980s, Paraguay entered a extreme 
 (time period where people and businesses made less money) resulting in a negative one-percent 
 growth in the gross national product (GNP). The 
 once-a-year average GNP growth rate between 1981 
 and 1986 was a very simple (or too small) 0.6% (BID, 1987). During 
 this same period, the rate of growth in farming 
 remained positive but dropped to a once-a-year average of 2.0%. By comparison, the average once-a-year 
 population growth rates went from 2.8% in the 
 1965-80 period to 3.2% during the 1980-87 period (World Bank, 1989). This poor money-based

 performance, along with fast population (act of something getting bigger, wider, etc.) and the lessening supply of public lands 
 good for (producing crops/helping something grow), has made farm working well growth a major policy issue in Paraguay 
 (Nikiphoroff and Villagra, 1987).

 actual operating input combination is Xa Â· P. 
 These three cost measures are the basis for figuring out/calculating the following technical (TE) and money-based 
 (EE) (wasting very little while working or producing something) indexes: 
 TE =

 EE = ( 
 
 We begin by assuming that the farm edge of something/unexplored area 
 production function can be written as: 
 
 (1) 
 where Q is the amount of farming-based output, xa 
 is a vector of input amounts, and 3{ is a vector 
 of limits/guidelines. The technically (producing a lot with very little waste) input vector XP for a given level of production (Q), is 
 received/made from by solving (at the same time) Eq. (1) and the 
 input ratios XII Xi= ki (i &amp;gt; 1), where ki is the 
 ratio of watched/followed inputs xl and xi at output Q. 
 If the functional form of the production edge of something/unexplored area is self-dual, for example Cobb- Douglas, then 
 the similar cost edge of something/unexplored area can be received/made from 
 (in a way when you carefully examine something) and written in general form as: 
 C=h(P,Q;y) 
 
 (2) 
 
 where C is the minimum cost connected with the 
 production of Q, P is a vector of input prices, 
 and y is a vector of limits/guidelines. By using Shephard's Lemma, we get: 
 
 ac 
 
 - 
 
 api 
 
 =Xi(P, Q; Â¢) 
 
 (3) 
 
 which is a system of minimum cost input demand 
 equations. Substituting a firm's input prices and 
 output amount into the demand system in Eq. (3) 
 yields the (money-based)/cheaply (producing a lot with very little waste) input vector xe. 
 Given a farm's watched/followed level of output, the similar technically and (money-based)/cheaply (producing a lot with very little waste) 
 costs of production are equal to X/ Â· P and to 
 P, (match up each pair of items in order), while the cost of the farm's 
 
 x: Â· 
 
 Following Farrell (1957), Eqs. (4) and (5) can be 
 combined to get the allocative (wasting very little while working or producing something) (AE) 
 index: 
 AE 
 
 To scientifically measure (wasting very little while working or producing something), we first guess a (random/including random data points) production edge of something/unexplored area and then 
 use the approach introduced by Jondrow et al. 
 (1982) to separate the mistakes from the edge of something/unexplored area into a random and an (wasting very little while working or producing something) part. 
 To show how this separation is good, 
 think about/believe the (random/including random data points) production edge of something/unexplored area: 
 
 (7) 
 where 
 
 E=v-u 
 
 (8) 
 
 is the composed error term (Aigner, Lovell and 
 Schmidt, 1977; Meeusen and van den Broeck, 
 1977). The two parts/pieces v and u are assumed 
 to be independent of each other, where v is the 
 two-sided, (usually/ in a common and regular way) distributed random error (v 
 &#126; N(O, a}), and u is the one-sided (wasting very little while working or producing something) 
 part with a half-(usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) distribution (u &#126; 
 I N(O, a} I). The maximum chance guess 
 of Eq. (7) yields estimators for 3{ and A, where 3{ 
 was defined earlier, A=(}',,/(}'" and (}' 2 = (}'} + (}'}. 
 Jondrow et al. (1982) have shown that the 
 ideas (you think are true) made on the (related to studying numbers) distributions 
 of v and u, talked about/said above, make it possible to 
 calculate the (may or may not happen, depending on something) mean of u1 given Ei as: 
 
 E(u

 1 The model presented in this section is based on the (random/including random data points) (wasting very little while working or producing something) rotting approach presented by BravoUreta and Rieger (1991), which is an extension of the model 
 introduced by Kopp and Diewert (1982). For reviews of edge of something/unexplored area function way(s) of doing things, see Forsund, Lovell and Schmidt 
 (1980) and Schmidt (1985-86).

 Eqs. (7) and (9) provide guesses for u and v 
 after replacing E, (J', and A by their guesses. If

 u is now subtracted from both sides of (7), we 
 get: 
 Q * = f( X a; 3{) - u = Q - u 
 
 (10) 
 
 where Q * is the firm's watched/followed output (changed to make better/changed to fit new conditions) 
 for the (related to studying numbers) noise (taken/took by force)/(taken/took control of) by u. Eq. (10) is 
 the basis for figuring out/calculating the vector X 1 and for 
 math-relatedally getting/taking the cost edge of something/unexplored area. Applying 
 Shephard's Lemma to the cost edge of something/unexplored area yields the 
 minimum cost factor demand equations which, in 
 turn, are used to get the vector Xe. 
 In closing this section, it is useful to point out 
 that an important issue in (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area 
 models is the distributional ideas (you think are true) made for 
 the one-sided error. Much of the books to 
 date, including this paper, has followed the halfnormal distribution, as (at first/before other things happened) proposed by 
 Aigner, Lovell and Schmidt (1977), (even though there is the existence of) the 
 fact that more flexible distributions are available. 
 One of the few papers that have examined the 
 sensitivity of the (wasting very little while working or producing something) results to distributional ideas (you think are true) was published (not very long ago) by 
 Greene (1990), where he introduced a (random/including random data points) 
 edge of something/unexplored area (detailed description of exactly what is required) that incorporates the 
 Gamma distribution. After comparing a few 
 (detailed descriptions of exactly what is required), Greene (1990) decided that, for 
 his data, (wasting very little while working or producing something) levels were mostly the 
 same for the half-(usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy), cut short (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) and 
 huge distributions while the Gamma model 
 cooperated with/produced/gave up higher (wasting very little while working or producing something) 2 . In a review of new 
 developments in edge of something/unexplored area function way(s) of doing things, 
 Bauer (1990) argued that added/more scientific as 
 well as possible work is needed to arrive at a 
 better understanding of the effects that other choice distributional ideas (you think are true) have on (wasting very little while working or producing something). 
 
 poor (person) farms producing traditional food crops 
 and cotton in Eastern Paraguay. The farms in the 
 sample are in the following eight districts: 
 Caaguazu, Yhu, Eusebio, Ayala, Yaguar6n, Pirayu, Villeta, and Ita 3 . 
 The analysis reported below focuses on the 
 two most important crops grown in the study 
 area, cotton and cassava, for which the data are 
 most reliable. After deleting farmers not producing these crops and throwing out incomplete records, 
 we end up with 87 cotton producers and 101 
 cassava producers. A total of 57 farmers produced both crops. This latter group is referred to 
 as the subsample. 
 The Cobb-Douglas functional form was used 
 to fit separate (random/including random data points) production edges of something/unexplored areas for 
 cotton and cassava using maximum chance 
 procedures. (even though there is the existence of) its well known limits, 
 the Cobb-Douglas is chosen because the 
 way(s) of doing things employed needs/demands that the production function be self-dual. It is also worth stating 
 that this functional form has been widely used in 
 farm (wasting very little while working or producing something) analyses for both developing and 
 developed countries 4 . What's more, in one of 
 the very few studies examining the hit/effect of 
 functional form on (wasting very little while working or producing something), Kopp and Smith 
 (1980) ended/decided " ... that functional (detailed description of exactly what is required) has a visible but rather small hit/effect on 
 guessed (wasting very little while working or producing something)" (p. 1058). 
 The use of the single-equation model showed 
 in Eq. (11) is (done for good reason) by assuming that farmers 
 (make as big as possible) expected (money made/good things received), as is commonly done 
 in studies of this type (Zellner, Kmenta and 
 Dreze, 1966; Kopp and Smith, 1980; Caves and 
 Barton, 1990). The clearly stated/particular model guessed is: 
 In Y 
 
 It should be noted that a few years ago Greene (1980) 
 introduced the Gamma distribution in the big picture  of a pre-decided edge of something/unexplored area model. 
 
 + 3{ 2 ln L + 3{ 3 ln M + E 
 
 where Y is once-a-year total farm output of cotton or 
 cassava (kg); R the area gave/reserved to cotton or 
 cassava production (ha); L family and hired 
 
 For added/more details about the data the interested 
 reader is referred to Evenson (1988).

 the scientific books (not very long ago) completed by Battese (1992) 
 and by Bravo-Ureta and Pinheiro (1992).

 5. Scientific results 
 
 M value of materials including expenses on 
 
 draft animal services, seed, and other (bought something for money) 
 inputs used for the production of cotton or cassava measured in thousands of Guaranies; /3; 
 limits/guidelines to be guessed (i = 0, 1, 2, 3); and E 
 composed error term defined earlier. The explanatory (numbers that change/things that change) included in the model are 
 like those used in previous studies of developing country farming (Taylor, Drummond and 
 Gomes, 1986; Taylor and Shonkwiler, 1986). A 
 major difference is that we guess separate 
 production edges of something/unexplored areas for two individual crops while 
 most studies depend on guesses of total value product edges of something/unexplored areas 5 - 
 
 The production functions were, at first, guessed including 
 District dummy (numbers that change/things that change) to account for possible effects of 
 location on the production structure of the farms in the 
 sample. The null guess that the limits/guidelines for the set of 
 dummy (numbers that change/things that change) was equal to zero could not be rejected for 
 neither crop for both the OLS and the edge of something/unexplored area models. 
 As a result, and as a way to simplify the analysis, the 
 district dummy (numbers that change/things that change) were dropped from the models.

 Table 1 shows the maximum chance limit/guideline guesses of the (random/including random data points) production edge of something/unexplored area (Eq. 11) for cotton and cassava producers 
 along with some descriptive statistics for the sample. For comparison, OLS guesses of average 
 production functions are also shown. In general, 
 the edge of something/unexplored area guesses amount to a neutral upward move/change of the average function. The function 
 coefficient for cotton is close to 0.90 while the 
 value for cassava is 1.13. These values are almost unaffected by the estimator used. Based on 
 restricted least squares moving backward, the guess 
 of constant returns to size cannot be rejected for 
 either cotton or cassava. These results are agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with the fact that all farms in the sample are 
 (compared to other things) small. The largest number of hectares 
 gave/reserved to cotton production is six while the 
 corresponding figure for cassava is three.

 B. E. Bravo-Ureta, R.E. Evenson/ Farming-based Money flow 10 (1994) 27-37 
 
 guess that the mean (wasting very little while working or producing something) (EE, TE and 
 AE) for both crops is equal, tested using t-tests, 
 is accepted for TE and rejected for EE and AE. 
 These findings are consistent for the overall sample as well as for the subsample of 57 farmers 
 producing both crops. Therefore, we end/decide 
 that EE and AE are much higher in cassava 
 production compared to cotton production, while 
 no difference is found across the two crops for 
 TE. Also, relationship-related analysis for each (wasting very little while working or producing something) measure between the two crops suggests a 
 positive but weak association. The relationship 
 coefficients are 0.12 for EE, 0.19 for TE, and 0.18 
 for AE. 
 For comparison purposes, Table 3 presents 
 (wasting very little while working or producing something) indices reported in different studies using data from a few countries. It is interesting to 
 note that our (wasting very little while working or producing something) guesses tend to be 
 lower than those reported by other (people who work to find information). 
 A clear exception is the study by Taylor, Drummond and Gomes (1986), who reported technical 
 and money-based (wasting very little while working or producing something) indexes much lower than 
 those found in this study. Their measures were 
 came/coming from a pre-decided edge of something/unexplored area which makes 
 them very sensitive to (things that aren't part of the main group). In fact, Taylor and 
 Shonkwiler (1986) applied a (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area on 
 the same data as Taylor, Drummond and Gomes 
 (1986) and found that, as shown in Table 3, 
 technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) increased from around 0.18 to 
 0.71 7 . 
 A few authors have (examined closely) the relationship between (wasting very little while working or producing something) and different (how money affects people's lives) (numbers that change/things that change) using two different approaches 8 - One approach is to figure out/calculate  relationship-related coefficients or to manage and do other simple non 
 parametric analyses. The second way, usually referred to as a two-step procedure, is to first 
 measure farm level (wasting very little while working or producing something) and then to guess a moving backward model where (wasting very little while working or producing something) is expressed as a function of (how money affects people's lives) attributes. 
 These analyses have been criticized by some who

 For a described/explained comparison of the hit/effect of other choice 
 estimators on mean technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) levels, see Bravo-Ureta 
 and Rieger (1990). 
 8 For a review of a few of these papers, see Bravo-Ureta 
 and Pinheiro (1993). 
 
 argue that the (how money affects people's lives) (numbers that change/things that change) should be 
 incorporated directly in the production edge of something/unexplored area 
 model because such (numbers that change/things that change) may have a direct 
 hit/effect on (wasting very little while working or producing something) (Battese, Coelli and Colby, 
 1989). Kalirajan (1991) has (not very long ago) defended this 
 practice by arguing that the (how money affects people's lives) 
 attributes have a roundabout effect on production and, because of this, should be included into the 
 analysis indirectly. Ray (1988) has argued that the 
 two-step procedure is reasonable if one assumes 
 that the production function is (related to multiplying numbers)ly 
 separatable in what he calls optional and 
 nondiscretionary inputs. The former inputs are 
 those usually included in production function 
 models while the last thing just mentioned are those commonly used 
 to explain differences/different versions in (wasting very little while working or producing something). This arguments is (compared to other things) recent in the edge of something/unexplored area books 
 and, this way, added/more research will be needed/demanded 
 before a resolution is found. 
 (even though there is the existence of) the arguing just talked about/said, we 
 still believe that it is useful to examine the possible relationship between (wasting very little while working or producing something) and (how money affects people's lives) (features/ qualities/ traits). For this purpose, we use 
 Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to (ask lots of questions about/try to find the truth about) the 
 association between EE, TE and AE, and the following seven (how money affects people's lives) (features/ qualities/ traits): (1) 
 SIZE, the total number of hectares in the farm 
 unit; (2) AGE, given by the age of the household 
 head; (3) Eouc, the number of years of education 
 completed by the household head; (4) ASSIST, 
 equal to 1 for those farmers that received technical help from a variety of sources, including 
 private firms, the extension service, credit institutions, neighbors and/ or family members, and 
 zero otherwise; (5) CREDIT, equal to 1 for farmers 
 that reported receiving credit and zero otherwise; 
 (6) EXTEN, equal to 1 for farmers that reported 
 having contacts with the extension service and 
 zero otherwise; and (7) EXHRS, the number of 
 extension field staff hours gave/reserved to field extension work on each crop in the district where the 
 farm is located. 
 The most striking end/end result that can be 
 gathered from the ANOVA results, shown in Table 
 4, is the lack of a steady pattern of association 
 between (wasting very little while working or producing something) and (how money affects people's lives) (features/ qualities/ traits). Some of these results, however, are agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with findings reported by others who have 
 
 B. E. Bravo-Ureta, R.E. Evenson I Farming-based Money flow 10 (1994) 27-37 
 
 studied the working well of traditional farmers. 
 For example, a weak association between (wasting very little while working or producing something), and education and extension has also been 
 reported by Antiporta (1978) for The Philippines, 
 and by Cotlear (1986) for Peru. In a recent paper, 
 using data from Pakistan, Azhar (1991) lends 
 further support to the idea " ... that elementary 
 education (4-5 years of education) does not have 
 much effect on farming-based working well" in traditional farm settings (p. 658) 9 - In our sample, 
 around 50% of the poor people had two years of 
 education or less, 30% had three years, and no 
 farmer had more than five years. 
 The clearest pattern that comes out is for credit 
 which is positively related to (wasting very little while working or producing something) in five out 
 of six cases. However, this positive relationship is 
 (meaningful numbers) only in one of the six cases. 
 By comparison, Lingard, Castillo and J ayasuriya 
 (1983) also found (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) that credit improved/increased (wasting very little while working or producing something) in their analysis of farmers in Central Luzon, in The Philippines. 
 Extension hours (EXHRs) shows the greatest 
 number of significant relationships with (wasting very little while working or producing something) 
 - three out six cases. (even though there is the existence of) this (meaningful numbers), no clear-cut pattern comes out about the effect that EXHRS has on individual farm 
 (wasting very little while working or producing something). Finally, the lack of association found 
 between (wasting very little while working or producing something), and experience and farm size 
 has also been reported by Kalirajan and Flinn 
 (1983), Huang and Bagi (1984), Belbase and 
 Grabowski (1985) and Lingard, Castillo and Jayasuriya (1983). 
 
 6. Ending/deciding statements 
 
 This paper uses a (random/including random data points) (wasting very little while working or producing something) rotting way(s) of doing things to get technical, allocative and money-based (wasting very little while working or producing something) measures for a sample of poor (person) farmers located in Eastern 
 Paraguay. The analysis is performed separately 
 for two crops - cotton and cassava. This analysis

 and Lau (1981), Moock (1985), Lipton (1985) and Philipps and 
 Marble (1986).

 shows an average money-based (wasting very little while working or producing something) of 40.1% 
 for cotton and of 52.3% for cassava, which shows/tells about that there is (large/relatively large) room for improvement in the working well of the farms in the 
 sample. The results of this study suggest that this 
 sample of poor (person) farmers could increase output 
 and, by that/in that way, household income through better 
 use of available useful things/valuable supplies given the state of technology. Gains in output coming from/caused by improvements in working well are important to Paraguay 
 (thinking about/when one thinks about) that the opportunities to increase 
 farm production by bringing added/more virgin 
 lands into (producing crops/helping something grow) have significantly reduced over the last few years while at the same time 
 population pressure has been on the rise. 
 An examination of the relationship between 
 (wasting very little while working or producing something) and different (how money affects people's lives) (numbers that change/things that change) did 
 not show/tell about a clear plan that could be recommended to improve performance. One possible 
 explanation for the lack of a consistent relationship between (wasting very little while working or producing something) and (how money affects people's lives) indicators might be the existence of a stage of development dividing line below which this type of relationship is not watched/followed. If this is the case, then 
 our results suggest that this sample of Paraguayan 
 poor people are yet to reach such a dividing line. As a result, our analysis hints that policies to 
 improve education and extension services, for example, would be needed in order to go beyond 
 this dividing line. Once this is good, added/more working well gains would be gotten by 
 further investments in workers and related 
 factors. It should be noted that this "dividing line" 
 argument has been advanced in the books as 
 a possible explanation for the (not being there; not being present) of a relationship between a few years of education (5 or 
 less) and farming-based output in traditional farm 
 settings (Azhar, 1991; Moock, 1981, 1985).
