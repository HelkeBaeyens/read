 Abstract 
 In developing countries animals are kept not only for their physical products, but also for insurance, financing, and to display 
 status. Though this range of purposes is admitted/recognized, animals policies anyway often focus on physical production: 
 a limited (way of seeing things / sensible view of what is and is not important) that slows the creation and (putting into) use of effective animals policies. This article presents 
 a complete evaluation of costs and benefits of animals systems that takes into account the institutional (surrounding conditions) of 
 animals keepers. Indicators are developed that (act of being taken or controlled by force), number, and organize not only the benefits resulting from the physical 
 production, but also those from the (can't be touched) functions. The method is illustrated by an analysis of (cows, bulls, etc.)  in the Western Area of control/area of land 
 of Zambia. The results point to/show that the opinion about  animals systems developed more closely reflects the watched/followed decisions 
 of the animals keepers.

 1. Introduction 
 Millions of land-related families in developing countries keep animals as their main farming-based business/project or as an business/project linked to crop production. The 
 roles animals play in these families are (many different things): 
 the production of milk, meat, hides, poop/fertilizer, draught 
 power, etc. as well as the collection of wealth, security against (events that are dependent on other things that might or might not happen), and display of status. These 
 different roles are admitted/recognized, with animal scientists usually (focusing mental and physical effort) on physical production, and 
 social scientists also/and including parts of financing, insurance, and status display in their analysis 
 (Baker and Bhargava, 1974; Bosman and Moll, 1995;

 Doran et al., 1979; Low, 1986; Moll and Heerink, 1998; 
 Rosenzweig and Wolpin, 1993; Udo and Cornelissen, 
 1998). 
 Animals development policies, including research 
 policies, generally focus on the physical production 
 of animals systems, often with a focus on marketed production (Behnke, 1985), and in that way neglect 
 the many functions of animals. One of the ways 
 in which this restricted opinion about  production becomes seen/obvious is in the issue of the working well of 
 "traditional" animals systems, such as (cows, bulls, etc.)  grazed 
 on shared land or free-roaming goats. Policy analysts generally describe these systems as "low productive," because the off-take rate is well below potential 
 levels. Animals keepers, however, seem to be much 
 less concerned with working well in this narrow sense, 
 and are prepared to keep low productive animals in

 their groups. The (based on what's seen or what seems obvious) (different/branching out into different) opinions on 
 animals by policy analysts (and policy makers) and 
 by animals keepers slows the creation of effective animals policies that take into account both the 
 government's and animals keepers' viewpoints. 
 The difference in opinions on animals rises 
 mostly because policy analysts leave out/keep out the institutional (surrounding conditions) of animals keepers, whereas 
 animals keepers include it. In developing countries 
 this institutional (surrounding conditions) is seen as illfunctioning, (not there; not present), or nonaccessible markets for products, production factors, finance, and insurance. This 
 means that the values of useful things/valuable supplies used for and products came/coming from animals are not necessarily reflected 
 in market prices, and that animals reaches roles in insurance, financing, and display of status. The last thing just mentioned 
 was clearly (showed/shown or proved) by Bennison et al. (1997) 
 in a study of (cows, bulls, etc.)  keepers in The Gambia where the 
 first (or most important) production goal proved to be the generation of savings, security, and valuable thing protection. In this 
 situation the standard cost-benefit analysis has serious 
 faults/problems and the results rarely reflect the opinions of animals keepers. It should therefore come as 
 no surprise that animals keepers often use production methods that deviate from the "best" methods 
 pictured by policy analysts. 
 This article presents an evaluation of costs and benefits of animals systems that aims to make policy analysis and resulting animals policies more effective by 
 focusing on the total complex of market and nonmarket 
 relationships of the animals system within the wider 
 big picture  of the institutional (surrounding conditions) of animals 
 keepers. The approach is based on: (a) a difference between repeating production and clearly shown/included production 
 to deal separately with regular income streams and irregular income from the sale of animals; (b) a difference between marketed and nonmarketed useful things/valuable supplies and 
 production, which leads to a discussion of prices and 
 values for individual animals keepers; and (c) recognition and guess of the services animals provide in insurance, financing, and status display. The 
 approach is related to all types of animals, either 
 individually or in groups. In this the analysis moves away 
 from the approach followed by Crotty (1980) who developed separate models for different types of animals. 
 The approach builds on the discussion of measuring the 
 benefits of animals by Behnke (1985) and expands 
 the money-based analysis to include the results 
 
 of the institutional (surrounding conditions) of animals keepers. 
 The result is a combination of cash income, noncash 
 income, and (can't be touched) benefits instead of a money-making state as a single limit/guideline. The evaluation (completes/goes along with) biophysical animals and crop-animals models 
 (Devendra and Thomas, 2002a, 2002b; Thornton and 
 Herrero, 2001) that mostly focus on the relationships between animals and crop businesses/projects and their 
 physical (surrounding conditions) as these put into numbers biophysical 
 relationships form the starting point for the (putting a value on something) 
 and test of useful things/valuable supplies and products. 
 Section 2 deals with the method in four steps. In 
 Section 3 the approach is applied to (cows, bulls, etc.)  grazed on 
 natural (area of grassy land) in Western Area of control/area of land, Zambia. Ends/end results about the method are given in Section 4. 
 2. The method 
 The evaluation starts with the organization of the 
 put into numbers useful things/valuable supplies used for a animals system and 
 the physical production received/got. After that follows 
 the (putting a value on something) of useful things/valuable supplies and physical production 
 within the farm household system, taking into account 
 the presence or (not being there; not being present) of markets for useful things/valuable supplies and 
 production. The benefits came/coming from the functions of 
 animals in insurance, finance, and status display are 
 discussed in the third stage, and in the final evaluation 
 the total benefits of the animals system are related 
 to the household's production factors used, by that/in that way 
 taking into account their options and preferences. The 
 analysis is shown in Fig. 1. 
 The focus of the analysis is on the animals system, 
 but this animals system is part of the farm household 
 system that may contain crop and care systems, as 
 well as other on-farm and off-farm businesses/projects. The 
 possible relationships between animals and crop systems are included in this analysis. The position of the 
 animals system vis-`a-vis other on-farm and off-farm 
 businesses/projects will be briefly organized and listed at the end of this 
 section. 
 2.1. Useful things/valuable supplies and production 
 Biophysical input-output data of the animals system form the starting point of the analysis. These data 
 are usually once-a-year averages per group in a steadystate situation, or averages per type of animal over

 or given away. The clearly shown/included production per period 
 is usually measured by subtracting the clearly shown/included production at the end of period t a' 1 from the clearly shown/included 
 production at the end of period t. 
 2.2. Prices and values of useful things/valuable supplies and production

 its lifetime. The input-output data are this way the (connecting point/way of interacting with something) between, on the one hand, the complex biophysical processes that deal with reproduction, growth, and 
 death, and on the other hand the (putting a value on something) of inputs 
 used and outputs received/got that result in an ex post test of the benefits of the system (Bosman et al., 
 1997). 
 In this method, the useful things/valuable supplies used in animals production are split into repeating (bought something for money) inputs and 
 the household's production factors directly employed, 
 such as family labor, land, and capital invested in animals and stables. Examples of repeating (bought something for money) 
 inputs are medicines and drugs, feed adds to/helpful additions and 
 food, hand tools, hired labor, and veterinary services. 
 The reason for this honor/difference lies in the (putting a value on something) of 
 the useful things/valuable supplies, which is dealt with in the next sections. 
 Animals production is separated into repeating production and clearly shown/included production. Repeating production becomes available according to the animals's 
 type, sex, age, and the season. Examples are products 
 and services such as milk, wool, poop/fertilizer, and draught 
 power. Clearly shown/included production refers to changes in body 
 weight, pregnancy (as proof of life-creating ability), and change in 
 abilities through training, or to changes in numbers 
 of animals if the analysis is at herd level. Clearly shown/included 
 production is this way production that is not ate/destroyed 
 but that is kept in animals as an investment. This investment results in future repeating production or it 
 becomes available when animals are murdered, sold, 
 
 To test the (thing that's given/work that's done) of animals to the income 
 of the animals keeper the useful things/valuable supplies used and production received/got must be valued. This (putting a value on something) is not a 
 plain/honest/easy process, as markets for useful things/valuable supplies and 
 products are (not totally pure/not totally correct) or even except for and this way do not 
 provide prices. More than that, animals keepers may have 
 differential access to markets, which means that the 
 price received/got by farmer x may differ from the price 
 received/got by farmer y, while for farmer z, who has no 
 access to that market, neither price is (connected/related). 
 Some of the useful things/valuable supplies and products are valued 
 through markets where supply and demand conditions result in prices. The nonmarketed useful things/valuable supplies and 
 products are valued within the families, using as 
 a yardstick the combination of useful things/valuable supplies, options for 
 using these useful things/valuable supplies, and preferences (designed only for/happening only within)  that 
 household. 
 For the analysis of the repeating production, the difference between marketed and nonmarketed outputs, 
 the former with market prices and the last thing just mentioned with guessed prices (both at farm gate level), is maintained in 
 the following two indicators. 
 The net repeating cash income in period t, Yct , is 
 defined as 
 Ytc = rjtm pjtm a' (ait pit ), 
 
 (1) 
 
 with 
 rm 
 jt the amount of repeating marketed production j in 
 period t, with j = 1, . . . , l; 
 a it the amount of repeating (bought) input i used in 
 period t, with i = 1, . . . , n; 
 the 
 price for repeating marketed output j; and 
 pm 
 jt 
 p it the price of repeating (bought) input i. 
 The net repeating cash income is a partial indicator, 
 but a major one for farm families, as they usually 
 work hard for cash income to pay for school fees, medical 
 treatment, and the (instance of buying something for money) of (products normally found in stores). 
 
 184 
 
 H. A. J. Moll / Farming-based Money flow 32 (2005) 181-193 
 
 The repeating income in kind in period t, Ytk , is defined as 
 Ytk = rjtn pjtn , 
 
 (2) 
 
 with 
 rnjt the amount of repeating nonmarketed production j 
 in period t, with j = 1, . . . , l; 
 pnjt the guessed price for nonmarketed output j. 
 The nonmarketed repeating production is ate/destroyed, 
 swapped/switched, or invested and as such is (capable of being seen and known) by 
 farm families and completely/in a hinting way valued. The (putting a value on something) 
 through guessed prices is for (related to careful studying or deep thinking) purposes. 
 The group value of the different types of clearly shown/included production is reflected in the sale price of an 
 animal. For murder animals the sale price is usually 
 just the total weight times the price per kg live weight. 
 For dairy or draught animals the sale price (usually/ in a common and regular way) 
 reflects the expected ability for future production. 
 Markets for murder animals are usually present, but 
 markets for animals in their productive period may be 
 thin, and in such cases, prices must be guessed. The 
 value of the clearly shown/included production in year t, Vet , is calculated by subtracting the sale price of the animal(s) at 
 the end of period t, P t , from the sale price at the end of 
 period t a' 1, P ta'1 : 
 Vte = Pt a' Pta'1 . 
 
 (3) 
 
 The clearly shown/included value in a year can be negative due to 
 loss of body weight, or reduced production prospects. 
 The combination of the net repeating cash income, 
 the repeating income in kind, and the clearly shown/included production, all over period t, gives the gross margin for 
 period t: 
 GM t = Ytc + Ytk + Vte . 
 
 (4) 
 
 The gross margin is the complete indicator for the 
 value of the net on-farm physical production of the animals system received/got by using the families' production factors. Combining the three parts/pieces into 
 one indicator helps the analysis, but for animals 
 keepers this one indicator is not (capable of being seen and known). However, 
 as the parts/pieces each are (capable of being seen and known) we may assume 
 that farm families take them all into account in their 
 test of animals systems. 
 The (putting a value on something) of the household's production factors 
 labor, land, and capital directly employed in the system 
 is discussed in the final analysis in Section 2.4. 
 
 2.3. The functions of animals in insurance, 
 financing, and status display 
 The functions of animals as security against (events that are dependent on other things that might or might not happen), as a means of financing, and in the display 
 of status are significant in communities where it is hard  or impossible to satisfy these functions by other 
 means. The (not being there; not being present) or (bad or poorly)-functioning of markets for 
 finance and insurance in developing countries, especially in areas away from cities, has been widely recorded/supported by, 
 for example, Von Pischke et al. (1983), Binswanger 
 and Rosenzweig (1986), Adams and Fitchett (1992), 
 Bosman and Moll (1995), and Hoogeveen (2000). The 
 result of the (not being there; not being present) or restricted presence of 
 finance and insurance institutions is that to deal with 
 the changes of life, people in areas away from cities search for other choices within their world/area/ball of command. Among the 
 possibilities are keeping animals, collecting gold and 
 jewelry, and investing in tree crops. 
 The insurance function of animals results from the 
 (possible power or ability within/possibility of)  being able to sell the animals in case of 
 emergencies. Having animals is this way similar with 
 having insurance, and the (not being there; not being present) of the need to pay 
 a higher cost can be thought about/believed the average (can't be touched) 
 benefit. Sieff (1999) carefully studied the relationship between 
 wealth and animals patterns of the (made something unimportant) 
 Datoga (people who raise many sheep, cattle, etc.) in Tanzania and showed that the 
 poorest families were forced to sell more animals 
 than were replaced by reproduction, and so were 
 faced with lessening groups. This reflects an extreme 
 situation: the families are not only too poor to keep 
 low productive animals as insurance, but they are also 
 forced to sell their productive animals. The insurance 
 function is important not only as it wasations where no 
 other means of storing wealth are available, but even 
 when there are other insurance options, because animals are easily convertible valuable things. 
 Insurance payments provide cover to a specified 
 limit for a serious and stubborn period, and the benefit of insurance, Bst , is therefore related to the average value of 
 animals for period t: 
 Bts = bs (Pta'1 + Pt )/2, 
 
 (5) 
 
 where bs is a factor pointing to/showing a proportion of the average sale value. To guess the factor bs , the different 
 insurance options must be tested. In their analysis of 
 dwarf goats in Southern Nigeria, Bosman et al. (1997) 
 
 H. A. J. Moll / Farming-based Money flow 32 (2005) 181-193 
 
 used an informal life insurance system described by 
 Ibe (1992), with a once-a-year higher cost of around 0.10 as 
 reference. Ayalew (2000) has discussed informal group 
 insurance in the Ethiopian highlands and guessed the 
 insurance benefit of goats to be 0.083 of the average 
 value of the stock. If other choice options are not present 
 a (guessed number that's probably close to correct) is needed/demanded, and a range from 0.05 for stable situations without major weather risks to a factor of 
 0.20 for situations with extreme risks, seems reasonable. 
 The function of animals in financing is (able to be seen/worthy of attention) 
 in three things: the (instance of buying something for money) of animals when 
 income goes beyond consumption needed things (Dercon 
 and Krishnan [1996] discuss income (mixes of stocks, bonds, etc./document collections) in (away from cities) 
 Ethiopia and Tanzania); the investment of clearly shown/included 
 production; and, the sale of animals mostly for 
 immediate consumption or investment needed things. 
 The last thing just mentioned thing/event is recognized in different facts or conditions (that surround someone). Behnke (1985) states in a discussion on 
 the price of camels, "richer Desert-living Arab continued to sell 
 a limited number of animals in order to meet their perceived very important rice needed things"; Low (1986) created the "sale for clearly stated/particular cash needs" guess in 
 the big picture  of (cows, bulls, etc.)  marketing in Swaziland; and Moll 
 and Dietvorst (1999) found in the Western Area of control/area of land of 
 Zambia that animals keepers just sold (cows, bulls, etc.)  in case of 
 a big and important needed thing of cash. Selling 
 animals to meet specified needed things has a number 
 of advantages: 
 - hedge against inflation, as the real value of animals 
 generally remains fairly stable; 
 - there is no need to keep cash safe (this is hard  in 
 (away from cities) facts or conditions (that surround someone)); 
 - the presence of cash is avoided, by that/in that way avoiding 
 possible claims from others that are hard to refuse 
 for social reasons; 
 - avoidance of storage losses if animals are swapped/switched 
 for goods; 
 - avoidance of the cost involved in borrowing for eating/drinking or investment purposes. 
 The benefit of financing through animals this way results 
 from the avoidance of cost involved either in storing 
 money or products (that are bought and sold), or in borrowing. However, the sale of 
 animals when there is a need, and not at the best 
 moment as figured out by/decided by the physical production or 
 prices, hints a trade-off between the benefit from 
 financing and the maximal cash returns. 
 
 185 
 
 The measurement of the function in financing must 
 focus on the sale (or direct consumption) of animals 
 because this forms a clearly (able to be seen or picked out) event, and because measuring the outflow covers previous investment behavior through the collection of clearly shown/included 
 production and the (instance of buying something for money) of animals. The benefit of 
 financing, B f , is related to the sale price: 
 f 
 
 Bt = bfPt , 
 
 (6) 
 
 where b f is a proportion of the sale price. The factor 
 b f can be guessed by (thinking about/when one thinks about) the cost or loss 
 got/caused in different ways of financing, such as: having a savings account; storing grain; getting informal credit; or, pawning jewelry or (able to last through tough conditions) person 
 products (that are bought and sold). In the studies by Bosman et al. (1997) and 
 Ayalew (2000) the guesses are based on the avoidance 
 of inflation for Nigeria, and on commercial interest 
 rates for short- and medium-term credit for Ethiopia, 
 (match up each pair of items in order), resulting in values for b f of 0.06 and 0.10. 
 The function of animals in providing status to their 
 owners is related to the presence or (not being there; not being present) of other 
 means to display wealth, such as (able to last through tough conditions) person 
 products (that are bought and sold)  and building materials. Status may not be an 
 completely (can't be touched) benefit, as it may play a role in owning influence, and (after that) increasing access 
 to useful things/valuable supplies. The benefit from providing status is, as 
 in insurance, related to the average value of an animal 
 (or animals) over period t: 
 p 
 
 Bt = bp (Pta'1 + Pt )/2, 
 
 (7) 
 
 where b p is a proportion of the average value. For an 
 guess of factor b p a value below the value for insurance seems appropriate as insurance, which may mean 
 survival, generally has a higher priority than status. 
 At best, guessing the factors bs , b f , and b p deciding/figuring out the benefits in insurance, financing, and status 
 display is guided by other choices that change/differ  in relevance. 
 Actual guesses this way require (not definite) judgments, 
 and so are open to debate. Yet as it wasations where markets are (not there; not present) or (bad or poorly)-functioning, doubtful guesses 
 are (certain to happen). 
 2.4. The analysis 
 The total benefit came/coming from animals production 
 is composed of the gross margin plus the benefits from 
 
 186 
 
 H. A. J. Moll / Farming-based Money flow 32 (2005) 181-193 
 
 insurance, financing, and status display. The benefit in 
 financing is measured over animals sold (or ate/destroyed, 
 or given away), whereas the benefits of insurance and 
 status display are measured over animals kept. The 
 difference between stock and flow leads to a separation 
 between the analysis for an individual animal and the 
 analysis at herd level. 
 The analysis of an individual animal over its lifetime 
 results in two indicators: the once-a-year benefits of keeping 
 the animal 
 p 
 
 Btk = Ytc + Ytk + Bts + Bt , 
 
 (8) 
 
 composed of cash, products ate/destroyed, and the benefits in insurance and status display; and, the one-time 
 benefit of selling the animal: 
 f 
 
 Bts = Pt + Bt , 
 
 (9) 
 
 the sale price plus the benefit of financing. One could 
 argue that the total benefit of selling an animal is reflected in the sale price. The sale price, however, does 
 not play a important role in the decision to sell when 
 markets are partially (not there; not present): it is not the sale price that 
 triggers the sale of an animal, but the purpose for which 
 the sale price received is needed/demanded. The benefit of selling an animal, Bst , this way reflects the benefit of having 
 the sale price in hand at the right time. 
 The expression of the benefits of a single animal into 
 two indicators similar things the difference between "production value" and "liquidity value" used by Baker 
 and Bhargava (1974) in their explanation on liquidity management, but in our analysis both terms have a wider 
 definition. 
 The total benefit of keeping an animal during n years, 
 followed by sale, is 
 n 
 
 Bn = 
 
 Bnk + Bns . 
 
 (10) 
 
 t=1 
 
 Dividing by n results in the average total benefit per 
 Â¯ 
 year, B. 
 The analysis at herd level is usually carried out for 
 a period of 1 year. At herd level no separate indicators 
 for keeping and sale are needed/demanded, as in an average 
 situation both apply. The gross margin takes by force/takes control of the 
 total physical production in a year, while the benefits 
 in insurance and status display and in financing are 
 measured over the average group and the proportion 
 
 of the group sold, (match up each pair of items in order). The total benefit in an 
 average year is 
 BÂ¯ = GM + BÂ¯ s + BÂ¯ f + BÂ¯ p . 
 
 (11) 
 
 The addition of all income parts/pieces into one limit/guideline BÂ¯ should not hide the trade-off among the 
 parts/pieces. This trade-off comes from/is caused by both biophysical and (how money affects people's lives) factors. For example, keeping 
 low-productive animals in the group on a limited area 
 reduces overall (related to the body function of living things) working well, but increases 
 the benefits from insurance and status. 
 The total benefit, either for a single animal or for 
 a group, results from the use of the household's 
 production factors--labor, land, and capital (L, G, and 
 C, (match up each pair of items in order)). Giving-out the total benefit over the 
 production factors to decide/figure out the (pertaining to each person or thing) returns 
 needs/demands prices for the production factors: 
 BÂ¯ = (L Ã-- pl ) + (G Ã-- pg ) + (C Ã-- pc ), 
 
 (12) 
 
 with p l , p g , and p c the prices for labor, land, and capital, 
 (match up each pair of items in order). These prices are either (partly) (not there; not present), or 
 not (connected/related) for all animals keepers, and this prevents 
 a general statement on the returns per production factor. However, the formula shows that, given the total 
 benefit and the amounts of labor, land, and capital used, 
 there is a trade-off among the returns per production 
 factor. 
 Animals keepers will test the animals system in 
 terms of the types of income came/coming from keeping and 
 selling on the one hand, and the household's production factors used on the other hand (Staal, 2000), and 
 will do so remembering their possibilities for using 
 their production factors in other on-farm and off-farm 
 businesses/projects; see Fig. 2. 
 The result of this test may differ by 
 household according to their particular goals and 
 values for the different income parts/pieces, their 
 factor gifts, and their access to institutions. 
 Analysts lack these individual and (not definite) references, but the complete evaluation of costs and 
 benefits presented above offers a (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) for combining guesses with watched/followed data. Sensitivity analysis of the guesses allows the analyst to relate the 
 total benefit of a animals system to a range of facts or conditions (that surround someone) experienced by different groups of animals 
 keepers.

 3. An test of (cows, bulls, etc.)  in Western 
 Area of control/area of land, Zambia 
 The method is illustrated by applying it to (cows, bulls, etc.)  production in the Western Area of control/area of land of Zambia. 
 (cows, bulls, etc.)  are kept in combination with crop production 
 and this combination is (existing all over a large area) in Southern Africa. 
 The data on the physical production were collected 
 through herd watching over a period of 5 years 
 (Brouwer et al., 1992; Corten, 1988; van Klink, 1990). 
 Prices and values were collected and guessed during 
 an overall test of the crop and animals subsectors (Mwafulirwa and Moll, 1991). The analysis below 
 refers to an average individual animal, a cow, over a 
 lifetime of 15 years, the lifetime covered in the herd 
 watching. 
 About 30% of the families in the Western Area of control/area of land keep (cows, bulls, etc.). The animals, of the Barotse 
 type, are kept in groups of 30 to 100 head, owned by 
 some people. During the daytime the animals 
 graze on natural (area of grassy land), under the control of a herdsman. At night they are kept in enclosures, kraals, that 
 are shifted often to spread the poop/fertilizer over the 
 fields where maize and millet will be grown. Meat production is the main purpose of the system, but cows are 
 milked (leaving enough milk for the calf), and little bulls 
 are used for transport and ploughing. 
 3.1. Useful things/valuable supplies and production for one cow 
 Labor is used for moving, shifting kraals, and 
 for milking. The capital included in the animals is 
 big: it forms 90% of the total valuable things of the 
 cattle-keeping families (Moll and Dietvorst, 1999). 
 
 (almost nothing/very little) amounts of working capital are used to buy 
 medicines. There is enough scope for more (cows, bulls, etc.)  in 
 the Western Area of control/area of land, so land (natural (area of grassy land)), is not 
 very hard to find and access is free. The useful things/valuable supplies used and the 
 production received/got over the lifetime of a cow are 
 shown in Table 1. On average the (related to the process of making children) period 
 of the cow starts in year 4, with some cows giving birth 
 in year 3 and a larger proportion as late as in year 5; 
 this distribution is reflected in the table. The average 
 number of calves per cow is about 3.5, with an 
 average calving period of time (or space) of 1.6 years. The weight gain 
 becomes close to zero from year 7 onward. 
 3.2. Prices, values, and indicators 
 The prices refer to the average prices during 1990. 
 The price for milk in the (related to a local area) capital, Mongu, was 
 10 K/liter, but in areas away from cities the price was (in a big way) 
 lower, so an average price of 5 K/liter has been used 
 to value the milk. 1 Most of the milk is ate/destroyed by 
 the household or swapped/switched in the community, but an 
 guessed 25% of the milk is sold for cash. (bought something for money) 
 inputs refer to veterinary drugs and medicines sold by 
 the Western Area of control/area of land Cooperative Union. There is no 
 market for poop/fertilizer, so the value of poop/fertilizer has been guessed as the total price of an amount of (material that makes plants grow better) with 
 equal nutrient parts/pieces. This is a (probably a little low) 
 guess, as crops on the sandy soils benefit from the 
 organic matter also. In a more commercially oriented situation in Kenya, Lekasi et al. (1998) found 
 that the market value of poop/fertilizer was about five times 
 1 Kwacha, the currency unit in Zambia; the average rate of exchange in 1990 was K 29 = US$1.

 will exchange such a cow for an ox from another (cows, bulls, etc.) 
 keeper if cash is needed/demanded. As a result, no prices were 
 available for cows in the (related to the process of making children) phase, and in 
 this analysis the price of a cow is based on the farm 
 gate price of 14 K/kg live weight paid for murder 
 animals by iterant traders (Table 2). The net repeating 
 cash income from a milked cow is small, around 150 K 
 (US$5) every year. The repeating income in kind during 
 the productive period was equal to 31 kg of maize 
 in year 3, 118 kg in year 5, and to 17 kg from year 
 11 onward. The once-a-year added value reached 1,063 K 
 in year 5 and after that got less to close to 75 K 
 (US$2.6). 
 3.3. Benefits in insurance, financing, 
 and status display 
 The Zambezi floodplain, where most of the (cows, bulls, etc.) 
 in Western Area of control/area of land are kept, is (only a little bit) good 
 for crop production. In average-to-good years the production of maize and millet might just be (good) enough 
 to meet the household's consumption needed things, 
 
 but in years with below average rainfall, staple food 
 must be (bought). In these facts or conditions (that surround someone) (cows, bulls, etc.)  form 
 the major insurance against hunger, as there is no formal insurance. A factor of 0.05 to 0.10 would reflect 
 a range of (compared to other things) good to bad/unhelpful local 
 facts or conditions (that surround someone). 
 Most of the (cows, bulls, etc.)  keepers had no access to (money-related) 
 institutions, and even if they had had access to one of 
 the two banks in the (related to a local area) capital Mongu, a savings account would have been unattractive as interest 
 rates on savings were negative in real terms due to inflation. In way of thinking/basic truth/rule, it is possible to store wealth in the 
 form of maize, but rodents and pests take a heavy toll. 
 In these facts or conditions (that surround someone) the most attractive option in financing is to keep animals until a big amount of 
 cash is needed/demanded (Moll and Dietvorst, 1999). A benefit 
 factor of 0.10 has been taken to reflect the unattractive 
 potential other choice modes of financing. 
 (cows, bulls, etc.)  offer a major opportunity to express status 
 in the (away from cities) communities, and people are known for 
 the size of their group. A benefit factor of 0.03 has 
 been taken to value the status aspect. The benefits in 
 insurance, financing, and status display are shown in 
 Table 3.

 3.4. Analysis 
 
 and there is (good) enough grazing area for herd (act of something getting bigger, wider, etc.). 
 (cows, bulls, etc.)  keeping is the major money-based business/project for 
 most of the population in the Western Area of control/area of land 
 and other choice uses for the total capital included in 
 the (related to a local area) group are not present. Neither are banks present that offer a hope of/future of real 
 positive interest rates in combination with acceptable 
 transaction cost. For these reasons the average opportunity costs of capital invested in (cows, bulls, etc.)  are set to zero. 
 The benefits can this way be attributed to the remaining 
 useful thing/valuable supply: labor. The return from keeping a cow ranges 
 from 106 to 222 K/manday from year 3 onward. To this 
 must be added the benefit received/got when the animal is 
 sold sometime within the period of 15 years. This return to labor per day is a lot above the return to 
 labor from crop production, which has been guessed 
 
 Having valued the physical production and guessed the benefits in insurance, financing, and status 
 display, the total benefit of a cow can be expressed in 
 the two indicators: the benefit came/coming from keeping 
 a cow per year; and, the benefit of selling the animal 
 at the end of the year, Table 4. The benefit received/made from 
 from keeping an animal declines after the (related to the process of making children) 
 period, but due to the benefits in insurance and status 
 display it does not become very small. The mere fact of 
 having an animal this way results in benefits. 
 In Table 5 the benefits came/coming from a cow over its 
 lifetime are compared with the useful things/valuable supplies used. The 
 value of the natural grassland used for (cows, bulls, etc.)  can be set 
 at zero, as there are no different types of land use

 the animal has been kept for 15 years it must be sold at the end of the year; no added/more benefit in financing is received/got in this case, 
 as the moment of sale is not a matter of free choice. 
 
 at 20 K/manday (Mwafulirwa and Moll, 1991). The 
 major money-based businesses/projects for the (away from cities) families 
 in the Western Area of control/area of land are (cows, bulls, etc.)  farming/managing money and crop 
 production, and keeping a cow, with a milk production 
 around 100 liters/year during her (related to the process of making children) period, 
 is this way an attractive business/project. This is due to the combination of physical production and the benefits in terms 
 of insurance, financing, and status. 
 The including in something in the analysis of these (can't be touched) 
 benefits has results for the decision to sell an 
 animal as it affects both the benefit from selling an 
 animal and the net present value of future production 
 (Fig. 3). The lines a, b, and c represent the net present 
 values of future production from the years pointed to/showed 
 until the end of year 15, including the sale of the 
 animal at the end of year 15. A discount rate of 0.10 
 represents the time preference. Because this analysis 
 
 is based on average production data, death is not 
 included. Including in something would not change the analysis as 
 the trash value does not move away (in a big way) from 
 the live weight value in the Western Area of control/area of land. Line a 
 shows a situation in which the benefits in insurance 
 and status display are not (connected/related) (bs and b p are both 
 0.00). Line b represents the present value of total future 
 benefits in a low-risk situation with benefit factors for 
 insurance and status display of 0.05 and 0.03 (match up each pair of items in order). A higher risk situation is shown by line c with 
 a benefit factor for insurance of 0.10. The lines d and 
 e show the total benefit of selling an animal during 
 the year, with benefit factors for financing of 0.00 and 
 0.10, (match up each pair of items in order). Lines d and a show a possible 
 situation with fully functioning markets for insurance, 
 financing, and status display (benefit factors all 0.00). 
 The sale of an animal should be thought about/believed around

 value of future production (line a). The combination 
 of line e with lines b and c reflects the situation in the 
 Western Area of control/area of land. The combination of lines e and b 
 represents low-risk situation, and the combination of 
 line e with line c represents the high-risk situation with 
 sales around year 12. The three combinations show 
 that with increasing importance of insurance, the moment of sale moves/changes toward the end of the lifetime of the 
 animal.

 the female animals in the Western Area of control/area of land and this

 leading to big benefits of (cows, bulls, etc.)  in insurance. 
 Fig. 3 shows that the overall effect of the including in something 
 of the benefits for insurance, financing, and status is 
 that the value of keeping animals increases relative to 
 the value of selling animals. This finding is in line 
 with the discussion by Low (1986) on the reasons for 
 keeping and selling (cows, bulls, etc.)  in the big picture  of nonmarket 
 benefits of (cows, bulls, etc.)  ownership in Southern Africa. It also 
 shows the limits of herd (testing out) models that 
 just focus on the interaction between herd size, herd 
 composition, and (something you choose to do, but is not required) dispatch. 
 This analysis of (cows, bulls, etc.)  at herd level in the Western 
 Area of control/area of land would show the existence of groups with older 
 animals than would be expected on the basis of an best physical production. In other situations, where 
 total food availability is the limiting factor, these 
 
 older animals fight against animals in the most important part of 
 physical production, the result being a total physical 
 production below what is possibly possible from 
 the available food useful things/valuable supplies. Zemmelink (1995) did 
 research in such a situation in East Java and compared 
 total feed useful things/valuable supplies with the total group of (buffaloes, deer, antelopes, etc.). 
 He found that the total group was (in a big way) larger 
 than the best size for physical production, and 
 decided that this could only be explained by taking 
 into account the benefits from the insurance function. 
 In East Java, and under the same conditions, there 
 is this way a trade-off between the benefits from physical production and the benefits from insurance, and 
 status. 
 
 4. Discussion and ends/end results 
 The method to carefully study animals systems described 
 and (showed/shown or proved) above first enables some income indicators to be created that (act of being taken or controlled by force), number, 
 and organize the different benefits of a animals system. 
 Some of the income indicators are based on current 
 market prices and are mostly valid for all animals 
 keepers. However, the indicators "income in kind" and 
 the (can't be touched) benefits are related to household (features/ qualities/ traits) that may differ (in a big way), such as household (combination of different substances, objects, people, etc.) and access to banks. 
 The identification of separate income indicators, that 
 together take by force/take control of total income, this way allows a focus on 
 
 192

 different groups of animals keepers. Second, for the 
 overall evaluation of the animals system, the summary of the different income indicators is related to the 
 costs of the system in terms of the household's production factors employed, by that/in that way taking into account opportunity costs. Again, animals keepers usually differ 
 in factor gifts and the evaluation can change something (to help someone)/take care of someone the different options open to different groups. 
 The relative importance of the indicators will differ 
 with the animals systems under analysis and the presence or (not being there; not being present) of markets for useful things/valuable supplies, production, 
 and services. The (cows, bulls, etc.)  production carefully studied in Section 3 happened in a situation with almost (not there; not present) markets for useful things/valuable supplies and services, a simple market 
 for milk, and with a functioning market for murder 
 animals. The case reflects an extreme, but not unusual/amazing, situation of restricted access to markets. In more 
 market-oriented systems, such as dairy production near 
 city-based  areas, the importance of the net repeating cash 
 income will be more well-known/obvious and more visible. However, the linkages with crop production (repeating income in kind) and the benefits in financing and insurance may still add/give (in a big way) to the total 
 benefit of the system. Also, in more marketoriented animals systems the household's production 
 factors--labor, land and possibly also capital--usually 
 have other choice opportunities in farming-based and 
 nonagricultural businesses/projects that generally have clearly 
 (able to be seen or picked out) types of income. The use of the 
 complete evaluation of costs and benefits of animals systems is therefore gave a reason for in a wide range of 
 facts or conditions (that surround someone). 
 Including the markets for useful things/valuable supplies, production, and services in the analysis of animals systems 
 enables (people who work to find information) and policy makers to test these 
 systems more closely from the viewpoint of the animals keepers. This is highly (connected/related) for the development of effective animals policies, because animals 
 keepers will test all proposed changes in the production system in the big picture  of their goals, factor 
 gift, and institutional (surrounding conditions). 
 
 Responses 
 I would like to thank Bill Thorpe, Steven Staal, 
 and Thomas Randolph of the International Animals 
 Research Institute in Kenya for their support and 
 
 comments during my sabbatical period at the institute. 
 My fellow workers at Wageningen University, Rob Schipper, Peter Roebeling, and Henk Udo, commented on 
 different drafts over a (in a big way) longer period, and I 
 thank them for their continued interest. Joy BurroughBoenisch (gave opinions about what could or should be done about a situation) on the English.
