 Abstract 
 Money-flow experts (asking lots of questions about/trying to find the truth about) personal demand have piled up (a lot of information that proves something) showing that people 
 generally have (not definite) preferences for (features/ qualities/ traits) of products and that their demand for products is 
 significantly affected by their perceptions of the product's attributes. However, the role of farmers' preferences in 
 adoption decisions have received very limited attention in adoption studies done by money-flow experts. This paper 
 tests the guess that farmers' perceptions of technology (features/ qualities/ traits) significantly affect their adoption 
 decisions. The analysis, managed and did/done with Tobit models of modern (grass grown for food) and rice varietal technologies in Burkina 
 Paso and Guinea, (match up each pair of items in order), strongly supports this guess. Our results provide a strong case for future 
 adoption studies to expand the range of (numbers that change/things that change) used away from the broad (related to how much money and power people have), (related to information about people) and 
 institutional factors to include farmers' (not definite) perceptions of the (features/ qualities/ traits) of new farming-based technologies. 
 
 1. Introduction 
 
 The importance of valuable thing-attribute perceptions has long been of interest to social scientists (asking lots of questions about/trying to find the truth about) farming-based t.echnology adoption decisions. In fact, scientists and scientists have played a lead role in this area and 
 have argued, using (not numbers-based) methods, that 
 farmers' (not definite) tests of farming-based 
 technologies influence adoption behavior (Kivlin 
 and Fliegel, 1966, 1967; Nowak, 1992). Money-flow experts 
 have generally fell behind in (asking lots of questions about/trying to find the truth about) this 
 issue. However, since most earlier works on tech-

 nology adoption by money-flow experts (O'Mara, 1980) 
 did not have access to direct (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) on 
 farmers' perceptions, it was not possible to directly and (numbers-based) test the guess that 
 perceptions of technology attributes influence 
 adoption decisions. Instead, (numbers that change/things that change) which affect farmers' access to information, and hence 
 their perception (creation and construction/ group of objects) (e.g. extension, education, (attention on TV, the Internet, etc.), etc.), are usually used in 
 money-based models of the (things that decide other things) of adoption 
 decisions (Feder et al., 1985; Shakya and Flinn, 
 1985; Kebede et al., 1990; Polson and Spencer, 
 1991; Strauss et al., 1991). 
 Money-flow experts (asking lots of questions about/trying to find the truth about) personal demand 
 have, however, saved (a lot of information that proves something) showing that people generally have

 (not definite) preferences for (features/ qualities/ traits) of products and that their demand for products is significantly affected by their perceptions of the product's attributes (Jones, 1989; Lin and Milon, 1993). 
 For example, using a double-hurdle model, Lin 
 and Milon (1993) found that valuable thing attributes and people' safety perceptions were 
 significant in explaining decisions to consume and 
 the frequency of consumption of shellfish in the 
 USA (in almost the same way), Jones (1989) found, using Cragg's 
 double-hurdle (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built), that people' (not definite) perceptions influenced cigarette smoking 
 decisions. Money-flow experts (asking lots of questions about/trying to find the truth about) the adoption 
 of new farming-based technology have fallen behind behind in (asking lots of questions about/trying to find the truth about) how farmers' (the people 
 of farming-based technologies) (not definite) perceptions of technology (features/ qualities/ traits) affect their 
 adoption decisions. In long/big reviews of adoption studies in developing countries (Feder et al., 
 1985; Feder and Umali, 1993), no study was found 
 to have carefully studied the direct effects of farmers' 
 (not definite) tests of farming-based technology 
 (features/ qualities/ traits) on adoption decisions. In their recent study, Adesina and Zinnah (1993a) found 
 that farmers' perceptions of the (features/ qualities/ traits) of 
 modern rice varieties significantly affected adoption decisions in Sierra Leone. The shortage of 
 scientific money-based studies on this issue permits 
 further (act of asking questions and trying to find the truth about something). The goal of this paper 
 is to decide/figure out the effects of farmers' perceptions of farming-based technology (features/ qualities/ traits) on 
 adoption decisions, using (serving to compare two or more things) analysis of 
 two technologies in West Africa (i.e. improved 
 (grass grown for food) varieties in Burkina Faso, and improved 
 mangrove rice varieties in Guinea). 
 A historical background of the development of 
 the new farming-based technologies examined in 
 this paper is briefly discussed below. (grass grown for food) 
 improvement activities in West Africa have been 
 a major focus of research managed and did/done by the International Crops Research Institute for the SemiArid Tropics (ICRISAT) which has the worldwide 
 order for (grass grown for food) improvement. ICRISAT's 
 (grass grown for food) improvement work started in Burkina 
 Faso in 1975/1976. Most of the first work was 
 on the (examining and testing so a decision can be made) of introduced and local 
 germplasm. Breeding started much later. Among 
 the principal breeding goals were: good and 
 
 stable yield performance under both traditional 
 and improved soil life-creating ability management conditions and good grain quality, especially for making 'to', a very popular local thick soup across the 
 Sahel (ICRISAT, 1980-1983). As striga-a (related to things that slowly feed off of and weaken other things) weed-has been a major problem facing 
 (grass grown for food) (and, in fact, cereal) farmers in West 
 Africa, a (completing/matching) program on (examining and testing so a decision can be made) 
 for striga-resistant varieties formed a major part 
 of ICRISAT's research program (Ramaiah, 1991). 
 Some improved varieties was developed 
 and tested in on-farm tests in Burkina Faso, e.g. 
 ICSV 1049 BF, ICSV 1002 BF, etc. While farm 
 tests have been managed and did/done on these varieties in 
 eastern Burkina Faso (Matlon, 1985; Wildschut 
 and Ouattara, 1987), little is known about the 
 factors affecting the adoption decisions of farmers. 
 Research on the development of mangrove 
 rice in West Africa is carried out by the West 
 Africa Rice Development Association (WARDA). 
 Starting in 1976, WARDA maintained a (related to a large area) 
 rice improvement program in Sierra Leone, targeting the (about) 200 000 ha of mangrove 
 swamps helped grow to rice in West Africa. The 
 mangrove rice ecologies, located on tidal rivers that are near the ocean, are important rice 
 growing (surrounding conditions) for six countries in West 
 Africa: Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Senegal, Gambia, 
 Sierra Leone and Nigeria. In Guinea, about 
 64 000 ha of mangrove rice area is under (producing crops/helping something grow), representing 12% and 18% of national rice 
 area and rice production, (match up each pair of items in order). Seeds of 
 the modern varieties (e.g. ROK-5, ROK-10, Kuatik Kundur) were (not very long ago) spread to being close to Guinea (Zinnah et al., 1993). One of the 
 varieties, ROK-5, has been more and more adopted. 
 In the Coyah area (the country's major mangrove swamp rice growing zone), it was guessed 
 that the percentage of farmers helping grow ROK-5 
 increased from 1% in 1989 to 15% in 1990 
 (Adesina and Zinnah, 1993b). On-farm tests managed and did/done from 1982 to 1985 showed that these 
 modern mangrove rice varieties regularly outyielded the best local varieties by more than 30% 
 (Agyen-Sampong, 1990). Little is known, however, about the (things that decide other things) of farmers' adoption of these varieties.

 The rest of the paper is divided into three 
 sections. Section 2 describes the idea-based and 
 scientific models, while Section 3 discusses the 
 scientific results. Section 4 presents ends/end results 
 and effects/results/suggestions of the results for adoption studies. 
 
 2. Methods 
 
 A given farming-based technology clearly shows/includes a 
 number of important (features/ qualities/ traits) that may influence adoption decisions. The watched/followed adoption choice on an farming-based technology (e.g. 
 modern crop varieties) is guessed to be the 
 result of a complex set of inter-technology 
 preference comparisons made by farmers. Let the 
 perceived benefits came/coming from growing a modern variety and the local variety be represented 
 by b(m) and b(l), (match up each pair of items in order). Let the ith 
 farmer's perceptions of the varietal-clearly stated/particular (features/ qualities/ traits) of the modern and local rice varieties 
 be given by Pim and Pi!, (match up each pair of items in order). Let the 
 other (related to how much money and power people have) and information about people of farm families affecting the adoption decision be represented as ci. For simpleness, let 
 these relations be represented as bmi = q(pim' 
 pil;c) and bli = w(pim,Pi!;c), (match up each pair of items in order). To 
 model this effect of perceptions of technology 
 attributes on adoption decisions a Tobit model is 
 used. This is represented below using an index 
 function approach 
 
 V; - = 3TXi{ + E; 
 
 V;=O if V;* 
 
 &#126;0 
 
 V;=V;* if V;*&amp;gt;O 
 
 (1.1) 
 (1.2) 
 (1.3) 
 
 where V;, a limited (thing that changes (like a test score) because of something else that you control (like study time)), is the 
 perceived benefit of adoption of the modern variety; V; * is an hidden (under) hidden/covered up (number or thing that changes) that 
 indexes adoption; X is the vector of (related to how much money and power people have) and information about people of the 
 farm household, and the technology perceptions 
 of the farmer; f3T is a vector of limits/guidelines to be 
 guessed; and E; is an error term. When the 
 inter-varietal attribute preference comparisons 
 are such that bmi- bli &amp;gt; 0 (i.e. V; * &amp;gt; 0) the farmer 
 is watched/followed to adopt the modern variety (V; = V; * 
 
 3 
 
 &amp;gt; 0). Otherwise, if bmi- bli &#126; 0 (or V; * &#126; 0) no 
 adoption is watched/followed (i.e. V; = 0). The model permits the (act of asking questions and trying to find the truth about something) of the decision of whether 
 or not to adopt and the (may or may not happen, depending on something) level of use of 
 the technology if the first adoption decision was 
 made. The Tobit model also has an advantage in 
 that its coefficients can be further disaggregated 
 to decide/figure out the effect of a change in the ith 
 (number or thing that changes) on changes in the chance of adopting 
 the modern variety and the expected use strength 
 of the variety. Following McDonald and Moffitt 
 (1980), it can be shown that 
 E(V;) =&amp;lt;I&amp;gt;(z)E(v;') 
 
 (2.1) 
 
 where E(v/) is the expected value of V; for 
 those farmers that have already made the adoption decision, and &amp;lt;I&amp;gt; is the total amount of (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) 
 distribution function at z, where z is X/3 I a. 
 (making different) with respect to any element of 
 X gives 
 
 aE( V;) ;ax;= &amp;lt;I&amp;gt;( z) aE{( v;') ;ax;} 
 +E(v;")a&amp;lt;I&amp;gt;{(z);ax;} 
 
 (2.2) 
 
 Multiplying through by XJE(V;), the relation 
 can be converted into ability to stretch forms 
 
 aE{( V;) ;ax;}XJE( V;) 
 =&amp;lt;I&amp;gt;( z) aE{( v;') jaX;}XJE( V;) 
 + E( v;' )a&amp;lt;I&amp;gt;{( z) ;ax;}XJE( V;) 
 
 (2.3) 
 
 Re-arranging this using Eq. (2.1) gives 
 
 aE{( V;) ;ax;}XJE( V;) 
 = aE{( v;') ;ax;}XJE( v;') 
 
 + a&amp;lt;I&amp;gt;{( z) ;ax;}XJ&amp;lt;I&amp;gt;( z) 
 
 (2.4) 
 
 The total ability to stretch consists of two effects: (1) 
 the change in the chance of the expected 
 level of use strength of the modern varieties for 
 those farmers that are already adopters, and (2) 
 the change in the ability to stretch of the chance of 
 being an adopter. 
 The scientific models are discussed below. For 
 the (grass grown for food) model, the (thing that changes (like a test score) because of something else that you control (like study time)) is the 
 share of the total (grass grown for food) area that is (helped to grow) 
 in improved varieties (ISSHARE), while the (things that change (like test scores) because of other things that you control (like study times)) are, (match up each pair of items in order), farmers' (not definite) tests of: yield performance 
 
 4

 (YIELD), the quality of the local thick soup (to) 
 that farmers make from (grass grown for food) (TO), performance under poor soil conditions (SOIL), tolerance to striga weed (situation where something is filled with lots of something harmful or disgusting) (STRIGA), and 
 drought tolerance (DROUGHT). It is guessed that these factors are positively related to 
 adoption decisions. In addition to these factors, 
 the following (related to how much money and power people have) and (related to information about people) 
 (numbers that change/things that change) were included as explanatory (numbers that change/things that change) 
 in the model: the age of the farmer (AGE), 
 whether or not the farmer was a village head and 
 the number of years since becoming village head 
 (HEAD), participation of the farmer in on-farm 
 tests of the improved (grass grown for food) varieties (TEST), 
 number of times the farmer was visited by extension agents in the survey year (VISIT), and 
 the number of times the farmer participated in 
 extension related workshop training activities 
 (WKSHOP). It is guessed that TEST and 
 AGE are positively related to adoption decisions. 
 Testing the varieties in on-farm tests can be expected to influence adoption decisions. The expected sign on AGE is an scientific question: it 
 may be that older farmers have more experience 
 in (producing crops/helping something grow) and are better able to test the 
 (features/ qualities/ traits) of modern technology than 
 younger farmers. However, it could also be that 
 older farmers are more risk disliking than younger 
 farmers and have a lesser chance of putting into use 
 new technologies. There is no agreement in the 
 adoption books on this as the direction of the 
 effect is generally location or technology specific 
 (Kebede et al., 1990; Polson and Spencer, 1991). 
 Based on the invention of new things-diffusion books, it is 
 guessed that extension visits (VISIT) and 
 participation in workshops (WKSHOP) are positively related to adoption by exposing farmers to 
 'new information'. 
 For the Guinea model, the (thing that changes (like a test score) because of something else that you control (like study time)) 
 is the share of the total mangrove swamp rice 
 area that is (helped to grow) in improved varieties 
 (RSHARE). Two classes of explanatory (numbers that change/things that change) 
 are included in the model. The first set (i.e. 
 technology perceptions) are farmers' (not definite) 
 tests of the following (features/ qualities/ traits) of the 
 rice varieties: yield performance (YIELD), ease 
 of cooking (COOK), tillering ability (to hold or do something) (TILLER), 
 and ease of beating/separating (THRESH). The including in something 
 
 of these (numbers that change/things that change) allows us to compare our results with those received/got earlier by Adesina and 
 Zinnah (1993a) in Sierra Leone. Based on these 
 results, it is guessed that these factors are 
 positively related to adoption decisions in Guinea. 
 Ease of cooking is likely to be important to these 
 rice farmers because of the lack of fuel-wood 
 for preparing food in the mangrove areas. Farmers are obliged to travel a few kilometers to 
 search for fuel-wood. Ease of cooking of rice 
 varieties is linked to the gelatinization temperature of the rice. Varieties with high gelatinization 
 temperature take longer periods to cook (Unnevehr, 1986). This increases the demand for 
 fuel-wood, a very rare/not enough  input in the mangrove 
 (surrounding conditions) where most of the mangrove trees 
 have been cut down by farmers. So, farmers 
 may tend to adopt varieties that puts less pressure on the rare/not enough  fuel-wood supply. Tillering 
 ability (to hold or do something) is also very critical in the mangrove 
 ecology because of the high damage to young rice 
 seedlings from crabs. Varieties that have the ability to produce tillers fast, and which reproduce secondary tillers following initial crab damage, are likely to be adopted by farmers. The high 
 labor demands for manual beating/separating in this farming system, where labor is the most limiting factor, may create (rewards or reasons for doing something) for farmers to adopt 
 varieties that are easier to thresh. Finally, better 
 yield performance over local varieties is expected 
 to positively affect adoption decisions. The other 
 (related to how much money and power people have) and information about people of the 
 farmer in the model are: age of the farmer (AGE), 
 the farm size (FSIZE), participation in on-farm 
 tests (TEST), visit by extension agents (VISIT), 
 and years of experience in mangrove rice farming 
 (EXP). The expected signs of these (numbers that change/things that change) follow that discussed above for the Burkina Faso 
 case. Also, it is expected that EXP is 
 positively related to adoption as more experienced farmers may be able to better test new 
 technologies. 
 In each model, the (not definite) perception (numbers that change/things that change) were defined as (divided into two) (numbers that change/things that change) that 
 take on the value of 1 if the farmer thought about/believed 
 that the new farming-based technology is better 
 than the local technology for a given technology 
 attribute, and a value of 0, otherwise. The empiri- 
 
 A.A. Adesina, J. Baidu-Forson /Agricultural Money flow 13 (1995) 1-9 
 
 cal models were guessed using an repeating/repetitive maximum chance computer code (White, 1978) in order 
 to get asymptotically (producing a lot with very little waste) limit/guideline guesses. The data for the Burkina Faso study were 
 collected in 1989/1990 from a sample of 57 farmers in the east central area. Data for the Guinea 
 study were collected in 1990-1991 from a sample 
 of 110 farmers in the Coyah area. 
 
 3. Results 
 The results for the (grass grown for food) model in Burkina 
 Faso are given in Table 1. The analyses show that 
 farmers' perceptions of four varietal technology 
 (features/ qualities/ traits) were positively related to the 
 chance of adoption and strength of cultiva- 
 
 5 
 
 tion of the improved (grass grown for food) varieties. Significant (at the 5% level) were quality for making 
 (grass grown for food) paste (TO) and performance under poor 
 soil conditions (SOIL). The coefficient on yield 
 performance (YIELD) is barely significant at 
 10%. Farmers' test of the relative tolerance of the improved varieties to striga 
 (STRIGA), though positively related to adoption 
 decisions, was not significant. The negative sign 
 on the drought tolerance (number or thing that changes) (DROUGHT) 
 is unexpected and may be due to negative relationship between this (number or thing that changes) and other varietal 
 (features/ qualities/ traits) not included in the model. Two 
 farmer (features/ qualities/ traits) were significant in explaining adoption decisions: the age of the farmer 
 (AGE) and farmers' participation in on-farm tests 
 (TEST). The last thing just mentioned (number or thing that changes) was the most highly

 significant of all the explanatory (numbers that change/things that change). This is 
 not unexpected, because long/big (grass grown for food) onfarm trials were carried out in the survey area. 
 The negative sign on WKSHOP is unexpected 
 and may be explained by the possibility that the 
 workshops farmers attended were not specifically 
 on (grass grown for food). Some authors have also argued that 
 what is important is not this contact with extension but how farmers test the relevance of the 
 issues discussed at such farmer workshops for 
 their actual production decisions (Zinnah et al., 
 1993). 
 These results have effects/results/suggestions for (grass grown for food) 
 technology improvement research in West Africa. 
 First, it shows that yield performance of (grass grown for food) 
 technologies needs to be tested by farmers 
 under their own soil conditions. The results 
 showed that varieties that farmers judge as having 
 superior yield performance over local varieties 
 under on-farm soil life-creating ability conditions tend to be 
 
 those that are adopted. Secondly, the analyses 
 show that (grass grown for food) technology development efforts should not only (focus mental and physical effort) on (related to scientific farming) 
 (features/ qualities/ traits). The strong importance of the food 
 quality (number or thing that changes) points to/shows that farmers are worried about non-(related to scientific farming) (features/ qualities/ traits). As 
 (grass grown for food) is mostly used in West Mrica for 
 making to, research efforts need to be focused on 
 (examining and testing so a decision can be made) for lines with appropriate good grain 
 and food quality for making this local thick soup. 
 One way to secure/make sure of this is to have farmers, especially women, test the food quality of all 
 (grass grown for food) varieties that are proposed for on-farm 
 testing in West Mrica. 
 Results for the Guinea model are given in 
 Table 2. The results show that all the four technology-(typical and expected) perceptions were strongly 
 significant in explaining farmers' adoption decisions. These results are almost the same as those 
 received/got by Adesina and Zinnah (1993a) in Sierra

 Leone. It is also important to note that a nonagronomic feature (ease of cooking) significantly affected farmers' adoption decisions. When taken 
 together with the results for (grass grown for food) in Burkina 
 Faso, it is clear that farmers think about/believe factors 
 related to food quality as very critical in adoption 
 decisions. This hints that the ordinary approach of focusing technology development 
 mostly on improved (related to scientific farming) (features/ qualities/ traits) 
 needs to be changed to also significantly include food quality (features/ qualities/ traits). 
 The Guinea results show that none of the 
 (what people commonly call a/not really a) 'contact' (numbers that change/things that change) were significant in 
 influencing adoption decisions. The lack of importance of the extension (number or thing that changes) supports the finding by other (people who work to find information) that (person who works to find information)-extension-farmer linkages are very weak in 
 Guinea and that most of the mangrove varieties 
 now grown by farmers were gotten via 
 farmer-farmer contacts (Zinnah et al., 1993). 
 (serving to compare two or more things) analyses of the results in Guinea 
 and Burkina Faso with the results earlier reported for Sierra Leone by Adesina and Zinnah 
 (1993a) show some important patterns in the role 
 of extension and other farmer contact (numbers that change/things that change) in 
 influencing farmers' adoption decisions. In the 
 case of mangrove rice varieties in Guinea and 
 Sierra Leone, extension had very little to do with 
 technology diffusion: this happened mainly through 
 farmers self-(trying new things out/testing ideas scientifically), test, exchange and move (from one place to another). In the case of (grass grown for food) in 
 Burkina Faso, long/big on-farm testing of the 
 varieties in some test-villages appears to 
 have affected adoption decisions. This suggests 
 that extension workers do not influence technology move (from one place to another) in all cases. Farmers are also important as sources of technology information and 
 agents of technology move (from one place to another). When farmers test the (features/ qualities/ traits) of new technologies and 
 find them to match their preferences, they often 
 give the technologies to other farmers to test and 
 test by that/in that way setting into movement an endogenous process of technology diffusion. 
 4. Ends/end results 
 
 The analyses in this paper showed that farmers' (not definite) preferences for (features/ qualities/ traits) of 
 
 7 
 
 new farming-based technologies are very important 
 (things that decide other things) of adoption behavior. The results 
 are strong in that this end/end result is the same for 
 the two different technologies examined in Burkina Faso and Guinea. The results agree with the 
 (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) given by studies of personal demand showing that people critically test 
 (features/ qualities/ traits) of a product and that demand is 
 affected by people' (not definite) tests of 
 product attributes (Jones, 1989; Lin and Milon, 
 1993). Farmers are people of the products of 
 farming-based research and their (not definite) preferences for (features/ qualities/ traits) of new farming-based technologies affect their adoption decisions. 
 Our results, which lend support to the earlier 
 finding of Adesina and Zinnah (1993a), call for 
 more possible and scientific studies to examine the effects of farmers' (not definite) preferences 
 of technology (features/ qualities/ traits) on adoption decisions. An advantage of the approach we have 
 used is that it is possible to identify the key 
 (features/ qualities/ traits) of technologies that need to be 
 targeted for improvement if adoption is to be 
 (accomplished or gained). Future studies in this area should overcome a limitation of the current analyses: the 
 data we had did not permit us to measure the 
 strength of the perceptions, as was done by Lin 
 and Milon (1993) in their study of personal 
 demand in the USA. We suggest that future 
 studies collect data that measure not only the 
 (divided into two) comparison of preferences for technology attributes but also the strength of those 
 preferences. Another possible limitation of the 
 current analyses is the possibility of guess 
 bias from (happening at the same time) if the perception (numbers that change/things that change) 
 and the other 'contact' (numbers that change/things that change) (i.e. contact with 
 extension, participation in on-farm tests etc.) are 
 endogenous. It was not possible for us to examine 
 this issue because of the (based on facts and other evidence) difficult/strong 
 econometric problems connected with guessing 
 (happening together) equation systems with dummy or 
 other limited (things that change (like test scores) because of other things that you control (like study times)). Also important is the need for studies to examine non-adoption of new farming-based technologies and how 
 farmers' (not definite) preferences for technology attributes play a role (Yapa and Mayfield, 1978; 
 Nowak, 1992). Anyway, our results provide a 
 strong case for future adoption studies to expand

 the range of (numbers that change/things that change) used away from the broad 
 (related to how much money and power people have), (related to information about people) and institutional 
 factors (Feder et al., 1985; Feder and Umali, 
 1993), to include farmers' (not definite) perceptions 
 of the (features/ qualities/ traits) of new farming-based technologies. 
 
 Responses 
 
 The authors are thankful to two unnamed
