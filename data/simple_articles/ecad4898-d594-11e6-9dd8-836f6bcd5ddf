 Abstract 
 This paper examines the effects of farm size, soil wearing away, and sml (protecting something from harm) investments on land and labor working well and 
 allocative (wasting very little while working or producing something) in Rwanda. There were a few key results. First, there is a strong inverse relationship between farm size and land 
 working well, and the opposite for labor working well. For smaller farms, there 1s ev1dence of allocative inefficiency in use of land and labor, 
 probably due to factor market access restrictions. Second, farms with greater mvestment in soil (protecting something from harm) have much better land 
 working well than average. Those with very worn-away soils do much worse than average. Smaller farms are not more wore away than larger farms, 
 but have twice the soil (protecting something from harm) investments. Third, land working well benefits (in a big way) from perenmal cash crops, and the gains to 
 moving/changing to cash crops are highest for those with low wearing away and high use of (material that makes plants grow better) and organic matter. Program and policy effort to 
 encourage and enable farmers to make soil (protecting something from harm) investments, to use (material that makes plants grow better) and organic matter, and to participate in cash cropping 
 of plants (that bloom every year) will have big payoffs in working well. Land markets that allow smaller farmers to buy land could also increase group 
 working well. 
 
 1. Introduction 
 Research on African farm working well from the 
 1960s to the present has focused on differences 
 between smallholders and largeholders in dual farming-based systems and on differences between technology groups or land (length of time at work or in power/right to permanent employment) status in smallholder 
 systems 1- Over the past thirty years, however, 
 soils have poor-quality and wearing away has become a major

 (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) problem in many African countries. 
 Access to land has become more and more held back 
 in smallholder farming-based areas that were earlier 
 land-plentiful. 
 Study has been rare, however, of how growing 
 land restrictions and worsening have affected farm 
 working well in smallholder areas. These effects are 
 issues of important importance in the East African 
 highland tropics. In Rwanda, for example, population density has risen quickly over the last three 
 20 years and is now among the highest in Africa, and 
 poorness is (existing all over a large area). With increasing land restrictions (connected with a (not part of the church)  habit/desire to smaiier 
 farms), farmers are more and more pushing onto the 
 delicate 'extensive margins', the hillsides (von Braun

 et al., 1991; Clay, 1993). Half of the farmland is 
 moderately to very much/very badly insulted/got worse. Improving farm 
 working well and fighting land worsening are 
 key food security plan goals of the Rwandan 
 Ministry of Farming (Commission Nationale 
 d' Farming, 1992). 
 This paper explores the (things that decide other things) of farm 
 working well in Rwanda, using a nation-wide, 1240 
 household survey over one year (1990-1991) by the 
 Rwandan Ministry of Farming, Division of Farming-based Statistics (MINAGRijDSA). We face/deal with 
 two questions. First, how does farm size affect land 
 and labor working well and allocative (wasting very little while working or producing something) on 
 smallholder farms? This is one way to approach the 
 more general question of how increasing land restrictions and population density are affecting crop 
 working well. Second, how does land worsening, 
 specifically wearing away, affect farm working well, and 
 (in the opposite way), how do anti-wearing away (soil (protecting something from harm)) 
 investments affect crop working well? 
 Our guesses are as follows. 
 First, neither explanation nor evidence allows 
 us to offer an clear guess for the relation between crop working well and farm size, nor the 
 relation between farm size and allocative (wasting very little while working or producing something). 
 On the one hand, smaller farmers may crop available land more intensively, using more labor, and 
 unplanteding less, whereas large farmers may underuse 
 land, unplanteding more, planting less densely, and using less labor per hectare. Smallholders could face a 
 virtual wage or opportunity cost of labor that is 
 lower than the market wage, and apply labor until its 
 not important value product becomes a fraction of the 
 market wage (Ellis, 1993). 
 There is evidence to support the guess of an inverse relationship between farm size and 
 land working well. In India, for example, Bardhan 
 ( 1973) and Deolalikar ( 1981) show that smaller farms 
 have higher land working well but lower labor working well. They point to the greater labor strength of 
 smallholder farms as the reason. Scientific tests of 
 the guess in Africa have tended to focus on 
 (related to the existence of two things) agricultures with land distribution Gini coefficients more than 0.50 (for example, van Zyl et 
 al., 1995 for maize in South Africa, Carter and 
 Wiebe, 1990 for wheat in Kenya); they find an 
 inverse relationship. Tests have been rarer in smallholder farming with Gini coefficients for land 
 
 distribution in the 0.30-0.40 range. An example is 
 Barrett ( 1994), who shows an inverse relationship for 
 rice farmers in Madagascar. 
 On the other hand, larger farmers could in your mind 
 make up for less family labor per hectare with 
 hired labor, non-labor (number or thing that changes) inputs, and capital, to 
 meet or go past land working well on small farms. 
 Adesina et al. ( 1994) show this for large rice farms 
 in Cote d'lvoire, and Rao and Chotigeat (1981) for 
 large farms in India. In both cases, larger farms had 
 better access to capital and nonlabor (number or thing that changes) inputs 
 than do small farms. More than that, smaller farms might 
 also have lower land working well because their more 
 intensive farming military clothing and insults the soil. Yet 
 E11is (1993) notes that a zone with better soils might 
 attract more farmers, giving rise to smaller farms 
 with better yields than in other zones. 
 More than that, comparisons have been rare of allocative (wasting very little while working or producing something) of small and large farms (testing 
 whether there is (state where all things are equal) between the not important value 
 product of a factor and the price of that factor in the 
 market). Exceptions include Carter and Wiebe (1990) 
 for Kenya, Adesina et al. (1994) for Cote d'lvoire, 
 and Savadogo et al. ( 1994) for Burkina Faso. The 
 Burkina study examined animal traction user and 
 non-user groups. The Kenya and Cote d'Ivoire studies compared labor and capital not important value products (MVPs) between smallholders and largeholders, 
 and compared the MVPs to factor prices. They found 
 that among smallholders the MVP of capital is wen 
 above the capital price for sma11holders, and near 
 (state where all things are equal) for largeholders; from this finding they guessed restrictions on access to capital among sma11holders. They also found that among sma11holders 
 the MVP of labor is well under the farm-labor 
 market wage. 
 Second, we expect that land worsening reduces 
 land working well, and soil (protecting something from harm) investments 
 raise it. The direction of the guessed effect is 
 common sense, but the scientific importance of the 
 effect has rarely (especially in Africa) been examined in developing countries outside of field-station 
 experiments. A rare example is Bhalla and Roy 
 (1988), who incorporated farm-land quality (proxied 
 by soil type, color, and depth) in their analysis of the 
 relationship between Indian farm size and working well. More than that, we expect interaction effects between 
 land quality, farm size, and farm working well. Sup-

 present/ask/stand in a showy and fake way small and large farms have equal land quality, 
 and there is an inverse relation between farm size 
 and land working well. Then, if small farms were to 
 suffer greater land worsening, that would offset the 
 inverse relationship between farm size and land working well. If they were to suffer less worsening, it 
 would magnify the inverse relationship. 
 We go ahead as follows. Section 2 presents methods and data, Section 3, patterns in the data, Section 
 4, moving backward results, and Section 5, conGlusions. 
 
 2. Methods and data 
 We use a production function relating output to 
 inputs and other 'conditioners' reflecting farm and 
 plot (features/ qualities/ traits) such as soil wearing away. From the 
 guesses of the function, we figure out/calculate  MVPs of land 
 and labor. We compare these MVPs with factor 
 market prices to test for allocative (wasting very little while working or producing something) and 
 guess  restrictions in access to inputs. We then move backward 
 the MVPs against conditioning factors such as farm 
 size and degree of soil wearing away. 
 
 where 3{ s are coefficients, x, inputs, z, conditioning 
 factors, and D, dummy (numbers that change/things that change). 
 2.2. Data 
 The data used are from a survey with weekly 
 (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) over 1990-1991, grouped to a oneyear cross section. The sample is a nationwide stratified-random sample of 1240 farm families, operating 6464 plots. The (a measure of what occurs naturally/sports boundary line) survey covered inputs 
 and outputs to cropping, and other plot and farm 
 (features/ qualities/ traits), but did not: (1) list portion 
 of own-and hired-labor to clearly stated/particular crops; (2) list portion of (bought) inputs ((material that makes plants grow better), bug-killers, lime) to clearly stated/particular fields or crops; (3) directly 
 watch/notice levels of soil wearing away. (We calculated wearing away 
 from plot (features/ qualities/ traits) and other data; see below.) 
 The (information collected to refer to later) are helped by data from the 
 one-shot, plot-level, 1991 Agroforestry Survey which 
 listed soil (protecting something from harm) measures taken by the 
 same sample of families interviewed in the (a measure of what occurs naturally/sports boundary line) survey. 
 
 2.3. Moving backward (detailed description of exactly what is required) 
 2.1. Production function form 
 The (detailed description of exactly what is required) kept/held is as follows 
 We use an (having no limits, rules, or barriers) translog production function because it is general and flexible and allows 
 analysis of interactions among (numbers that change/things that change) (Antle and 
 Capalbo, 1988) 2 - The Cobb-Douglas is a special 
 case of the translog, when the interaction terms have 
 zero coefficients. But unlike the Cobb-Douglas, the 
 translog function does not always create elasticities of substitution of one, and the isoquants and 
 not important products came/coming from the translog depend 
 on the coefficients on the interaction terms (Debertin, 1986) 3 . The general form is: 
 
 4- 
 
 In( OUTPUT)= 3{ 0 + 3{ 1lnLABOR + 3{ 2 lnLAND

 2 Our use of the (having no limits, rules, or barriers) form avoids problems of inflexibility of the translog under restrictions, discussed in Driscoll et al. 
 (1992). 
 3 The not important product of x 
 1 in the trans log model is given as 
 follows in a two-input model with output y: MPP of x 1 = 
 y[ /3 1 j x 1 + T /2 In x 2 (I/ x 1)). Debertin (1986), p. 208. 
 
 4 The kept/held move backwardors were tested for exogeneity using the 
 procedure in Rivers and Vuong (1988), and they were all found 
 (coming from the outside of something). To reduce the math-based load, we threw out/thrown out 
 (numbers that change/things that change) not significant (related to numbers) (at 10%) or important (money-based)/cheaply. The (numbers that change/things that change) dropped included the quadratic terms for 
 labor and land, and interaction terms that included FRAGMENT, 
 AGEFARM, DISTANCE, RENTED, and dummies for SOUTHWEST, NORTHCENTER, and EAST. We tested and rejected (at 
 5%) the guess that the coefficients on these rejected (numbers that change/things that change) 
 are different from zero.

 OUTPUT is the value of crops produced (the sum 
 over crops, the output of each of which is weighted 
 by the market price at harvest 1990). The group 
 is used because, although our data show portion of 
 land to clearly stated/particular crops, we lack data on labor and 
 (material that makes plants grow better) portion per crop. More than that, most Rwandan farms have a large share of land in mixed 
 cropping. 
 Bardhan (1973) notes, however, that such grouping (ignores/doesn't notice) the effect of crop mix and that 
 differences in group working well between small 
 and large farms are attributed to size or returns to 
 scale while in reality they are the result of the crop 
 composition of output. That is, farmers who grow 
 crops with higher market prices appear to be more 
 'productive' than others who may produce the same 
 physical yields, but of crops with lower market 
 value. We face/deal with this problem by controlling for 
 crop mix, with the substitute being the share of 'high 
 value crops' (SHAREHVC), bananas and coffee, in 
 the gross value of output. These are 'cash repeating 
 crops' that tend also to protect the soil better than 
 (semi-survival/income) once-a-year crops, such as grains, tubers, roots, and pulses. 
 LABOR is expressed in adult-equal-days per 
 hectare, and is the sum of family labor and hired 
 labor. It is treated as (coming from the outside of something) because it is mainly 
 family labor from family size and composition data 5- 
 LAND is hectares of (helped to grow) land. It treated as 
 (coming from the outside of something) because 90% of farmed land is owned, 
 not rented, (areas of owned land) are set by traditional land 
 rights, and there is no formal land market for (instance of buying something for money) and sale. 
 
 5 Available labor for the household in person-days per hectare 
 (total family labor+ labor hired -labor sold) is (done or made to look the same way every time) into 
 adult equals (AE): I for adults ((old/allowed to get old/got older) between 16 and 60) and 
 0.25 for children (between 6 and 15) and seniors (above 60). 
 
 All farmers use hoe and knife and none uses 
 animal traction. There is very little use of chemical 
 (material that makes plants grow better), lime, and bug-killers (see Section 3). Soil 
 life-creating ability is maintained mainly by unplanted and use of 
 poop/fertilizer. We lack data on amounts of (material that makes plants grow better) and 
 poop/fertilizer used. For simpleness, we assume that plots 
 are equally fertilized, and use a (substitute-related) (number or thing that changes), 
 FERTSHARE, the share of (helped to grow) area on which 
 poop/fertilizer, (mix of dead leaves, manure, etc.), chemical (material that makes plants grow better), lime, or bug-killer is used. 
 FRAGMENT, the number of plots, reflects farm 
 breaking (up). DISTANCE is the average time the 
 farmer must travel from the residence to the plots 
 (averaged over plots, weighted by plot area). We 
 expect that the more plots the farm has, and the more 
 distant they are from the house, the less productive is the farm operation. 
 Two (numbers that change/things that change) reflect soil quality, AGEFARM 
 and EROSION. AGEFARM is the average number 
 of years since (producing crops/helping something grow) began on now farmed 
 plots (averaged over plots, weighted by plot area). 
 We expect older plots to be less productive. 
 EROSION is the average once-a-year soil loss in tons 
 ha- 1 per farm (averaged over plots, weighted by 
 plot area). It is calculated using the Universal Soil 
 Loss Equation, the USLE (Morgan, 1986; Hudson, 
 1993). Using the survey data and secondary data 6 , 
 one index per plot is calculated as the product of the 
 following indices: (I) rainfall and runoff; (2) soil 
 erodibility; (3) length of the plot (compared with a 
 standard field of 22.6 m); (4) slope of the plot 
 relative to a standard (9%); (5) C-value (the ratio of 
 soil loss on a plot under a standard treatment of 
 helped grow bare unplanted compared to the soil loss 
 expected from the crop mix and cropping practice 
 used on the current plot); (6) soil (protecting something from harm) practices expressed as the ratio of the soil loss of the plot 
 (given soil (protecting something from harm) measures used thereon) to 
 that of a plot with no (protecting something from harm) practice. 
 Land RENTED is the share of (helped to grow) area 
 rented per household. Our guess is confusing 
 as to its effect. On the one hand, we expect that 
 farmers invest less effort in improving rented plots. 
 On the other hand, farmers usually try to rent the 
 best land available.

 Dummy (numbers that change/things that change) are used to take by force/take control of effects of 
 agroclimatic zone. The zone dummy (numbers that change/things that change) are 
 NORTHWEST, SOUTHWEST, NORTHCENTER, 
 and EAST. The constant of the function contains the 
 effect of the SOUTHCENTER zone. The zones follow the description/separation given by Clay and Dejaegher 
 (1987). They differ by rainfall, height, soil quality, 
 crop mix, and vegetal cover. The Northwest zone 
 covers the volcano-related highlands and the upper parts of 
 Lake Kivu's shore and the Zaire-Nile divide. It has 
 high rainfall, (compared to other things) small farms, and soils with 
 low organic matter. The Southwest, Northcenter, and 
 Southcenter are almost the same, with low yields, smaller 
 farms, and poor, insulted/got worse soils. The East is a low 
 height plain, with less rainfall and bigger farms, 
 more life-giving soils, and was (not very long ago) (filled up with people or other living things). In 
 general, the western zones are rainier and higher 
 height, with soils that have been farmed much 
 longer than those to the east. 
 
 farms grouped according to relative farm size: 'smallest', averaging 0.34 ha; 'middle', 0.83 ha; 'largest', 
 2.38 ha 7 . (even though there is the existence of) its name, the 'largest' tercile 
 farms are still much smaller than farms in other 
 agroecological areas of Africa outside the (related to areas near the Equator/hot and humid) 
 highlands. But the average largest-tercile farm is 
 seven times larger than the average smallest-tercile 
 farm. The largest tercile holds 68% of the land, 
 compared with only 10% by the smallest. The Gini 
 coefficient of landholding is 0.38. 
 Compared with the largest farms, the smallest 
 farms: (1) have three times higher land-yields in 
 value terms; (2) use four times more labor per 
 hectare; (3) have four times the number of plots per 
 hectare (hence the farms are more broken-up); (4) 
 have fanned the holding for fewer years; (5) have 
 plots grouped closer to the house; (6) have nearly 
 twice the share of land rented; (7) have only (a) little 
 less worn-away soils; (8) have twice as much soil (protecting something from harm) investment per hectare; (9) use the same (tiny) 
 amount of chemical (material that makes plants grow better); and (10) have about 
 
 3. Patterns

 the same share of land under 'high valued crops' 
 (coffee and bananas). 
 That the smallest farms are now no more 
 wore away than the largest farms may be due to the 
 farms' being newer and getting more soil (protecting something from harm) investment. They are not, on average over the 
 country, husbanded more carefully in terms of getting more soil changes or having more of 
 their area planted to the land-protecting plants (that bloom every year), 
 bananas and coffee. Nor do they have the option of 
 unplanteding as much as larger farmers do. As these 
 smallest farms age, one can expect over a long time 
 for them to suffer greater soil worsening - unless 
 this is eliminated by more use of soil changes and 
 more land under plants (that bloom every year). 
 
 4. Moving backward results 
 4.1. The (things that decide other things) of production 
 Table 2 shows production moving backward results. We 
 discuss only significant coefficients. Effects are in 
 general as expected. Positive effects on the group 
 value of crop output are produced by LAND, LABOR, and SHAREHVC, being in the NORTHCENTER and the EAST, and by the interaction of LABOR and the NORTHWEST, and by LAND and the 
 NORTHWEST. Negative effects are produced by the 
 interaction of LAND and EROSION, by AGEFARM, by being in the NORTHWEST, and by the 
 interaction of LABOR and FERTSHARE (the last 
 being unexpected). 
 4.2. Average and not important value products and their 
 (things that decide other things) 
 Table 3 shows average value products (AVPs) 
 and not important value products (MVPs) of land and 
 labor. They are calculated taking into account the 
 only effects of the factor plus the effects of its 
 interactions with other (numbers that change/things that change). 
 The A VP and the MVP of land (labor) decrease 
 (increase) as the farm-size tercile increases. Bhalla 
 (1988) notes, however, that an watched/followed inverse 
 relationship between farm size and the MVP or AVP 
 of land can depend on how one (separates into layers) the sample. 
 To test the strength of our findings, and to see 
 
 how the MVPs are affected by other (numbers that change/things that change), we 
 specified the following function quadratic in land 8 : 
 MVP (land; labor) 
 
 = f3o 
 
 + f3 1LAND + 3{ 2 LAND 2 + 3{ 3 EROSION 
 
 + 34{ SOILCONS + 35{ FERTSHARE 
 
 + 36{ SHAREHVC + 3{ 7 NORTHWEST + u 
 (3) 
 Table 4 shows moving backward results for (3). They 
 show a strong inverse relationship between farm size 
 (LAND) and the MVP of land, and a positive relationship between farm size and the MVP of labor. 
 The relations are U-shaped. EROSION has a strong 
 negative effect on the land MVP, but the effect on 
 labor's is not significant. The effect of SOILCONS 
 on the land MVP is strong and significant, but the 
 effect on the labor MVP is not. In contrast to its 
 unimportant or surprising effects on output, 
 here FERTSHARE improves land working well, as 
 expected. NORTHWEST zone farmers also have 
 greater land working well after controlling for farm 
 size, probably due to the rich soils and high rainfall. 
 A greater SHAREHVC also strongly increases both 
 land and labor working well in value terms. 
 Table 3 also compares the MVPs of land and 
 labor with factor prices - the market wage and the 
 land rental rate (as a substitute for the market price of 
 land). Watch/notice that the farmers in the smallest-farms 
 tercile apply labor until the labor MVP is only a 
 third of the market wage compared to two-thirds for 
 the largest farms. This hints a 'bottling-up' of 
 labor on the smallest farms, with a lower opportunity 
 cost of labor than that reflected in the farm labor 
 market. This may be due to restrictions to access to 
 that labor market as well as to nonagricultural employment opportunities. 
 On the smallest-tercile farms, the land MVP is 
 much higher than the land rental rate, pointing to/showing 
 restrictions on access to land. Very differently, for the 
 largest farms, the land MVP and the rental rate come 
 near (state where all things are equal). 
 
 8 We tested for relationship between SOILCONS and EROSION 
 and rejected multicollinearity.

 scarcest factor. The effects on the labor MVPs are 
 included in the tables for reference. 
 First, when EROSION increases from low to high, 
 Table 5a shows the land MVP decreases 30%. Table 
 5b shows that on farms with a high SHAREHVC (of 
 cash plants (that bloom every year), coffee and bananas) and high 
 FERTSHARE, the effect of moving from low to high 
 EROSION is only 24%. With a low SHAREHVC 
 (hence a high share of once-a-year crops, which have high 
 C-values, which make land more (able to be easily worn away by rain, wind, etc.)) and low 
 FERTSHARE, increasing EROSION from low to 
 high has a large hit/effect, 51%.

 Second, when SOILCONS (soil (protection of natural things/using less energy, water, etc.) investment per hectare) increases from low to high, 
 Table 5a shows that the land MVP increases by 21%. 
 Table 5e compares over farms using a triple separation (into layers) (low and high EROSION, SHAREHVC, and 
 FERTSHARE), holding all else constant. The farms 
 
 that benefit most from soil (protecting something from harm) investment 
 are those with high EROSION, low SHAREHVC 
 (again suggesting a high share of once-a-year crops, which 
 protect the soil less than the cash plants (that bloom every year)), and 
 low or high FERTSHARE. The effect of moving 
 from low to high SOILCONS is 42% and 35%, 
 
 F. Byiringiro, T. Reardon/ Farming-based Money flow 15 (1996) 127-136 
 
 (match up each pair of items in order) for low and high FERTSHARE. Those 
 that benefit least are those with low EROSION, high 
 SHAREHVC, and low or high FERTSHARE. The 
 effect of moving from low to high SOILCONS is to 
 increase land MVP only 15% for high FERTSHARE 
 and 18% for low. Because of this, from the viewpoint of the 
 reduction of wearing away and improvement of land life-creating ability, producing cash plants (that bloom every year) and investments in 
 soil (protecting something from harm) are to a certain extent substitutes. 
 Third, when FERTSHARE increases from low to 
 high, because of this more (helped to grow) land receives chemical 
 (material that makes plants grow better) andjor organic matter, Table 5a shows that 
 the land MVP rises by 15%. Table 5c shows that on 
 farms with high EROSION and low SHAREHVC, 
 the gain in land MVP in moving from low to high 
 FERTSHARE can be as high as 44%. Because of this, the 
 need for soil changes is greatest where land is 
 already wore away and once-a-year crops are intensively 
 cropped and so there is need for replacement of 
 soil (vitamins, minerals, protein, etc.). 
 Fourth, when SHAREHVC increases from low to 
 high, because of this repeating cash cropping increases in 
 importance, Table 5d shows that the hit/effect is quite 
 high on land MVP (92%) (the cash plants (that bloom every year) coffee 
 and bananas pay so much more than food once-a-years 
 such as beans and tubers and grain). The effect is 
 highest where farm conditions are good - when 
 EROSION is low and FERTSHARE is high, and 
 lowest (39%) when farm conditions are poor (high 
 EROSION, low FERTSHARE). Because of this, producers of 
 cash plants (that bloom every year) have (reward or reason for doing something) to improve farm conditions, although producing bananas and coffee is 
 itself a life-creating ability-improving and soil-protecting measure. 
 
 5. Ends/end results 
 This paper talked to/looked at the issue of how growing 
 population pressure and land restrictions - which 
 translate into tiny farms and land wearing away - affect 
 land and labor working well. We explored: (1) whether 
 the smaller farms have greater average and not important 
 land working well than the larger farms, and whether 
 the smaller farms are less allocatively (producing a lot with very little waste); and 
 (2) whether and how much soil wearing away reduces, and 
 soil (protecting something from harm) investments increase, land working well. Both questions were answered with a strong 
 
 135 
 
 positive/agreeing. More than that, the inverse relationship is not 
 lessened by the smaller farms' being more wore away, 
 (even though there is the existence of) their farming more intensively (with less 
 unplanted). In fact, smaller farms are not more wore away 
 than larger farms. More than that, the inverse relationship 
 is not lessened by larger farms' using more nonlabor inputs or by their putting more of their land 
 under cash plants (that bloom every year). In fact, larger farms do not do 
 more of either compared to smaller farms. 
 More than that, we find the not important value product of 
 land on smaller farms to be well above the rental 
 price of land, suggesting factor use inefficiency and 
 restrictions to land access. Very differently, the not important 
 value product of labor on smaller farms was weii 
 below the market wage. This hints a 'bottling up' 
 of labor on smaiier farms, and restrictions to access 
 to labor market opportunities, and maybe (blocking things) to 
 entry into smaii business. Because of this, attention to the 
 reform of land markets is needed even as it wasations 
 where land size distribution is only moderately unequal and total farm sizes are small. Attention to 
 ways to increase smaii farmers' access to the labor 
 market will help employ 'surplus' household labor 
 while providing more income to the poor. 
 The smailest-tercile farms do at least one thing 
 quite differently to offset their being able to faiiow 
 much less. They invest twice as much per hectare in 
 soil (protecting something from harm) compared with the largest-tercile 
 farms. The biggest gainers from such investments are 
 farms with a high share of once-a-year food crops, high 
 wearing away, and low (the adding of things to soil to make plants grow better) rates. Those that gain 
 the least are those with a high share of repeating 
 cash crops and low wearing away. While it pays repeating 
 cash crop producers to improve farm conditions, to a 
 certain extent producing coffee and bananas is a 
 substitute for expensive (protecting something from harm) investments (because bananas and coffee keep/hold soil and provide 
 cover). Cash cropping also strongly increases smaiiholder incomes. 
 But only one-third of farmland (in sickness  strata) is 
 under cash plants (that bloom every year). For the rest of the land (under 
 semi-survival/income grains, (peas, beans, lentils, etc.), and roots and tubers), the gross payoff is high to soil conservation 
 and (material that makes plants grow better) 1 poop/fertilizer application. Because of this, programs 
 and policies that reduce the cost and increase the use 
 of these investments and inputs will have great returns to land working well in a country where each 
 hectare will count in the struggle for food security.
