 Abstract 
 Risk and doubt have been a lot studied by farming-based money-flow experts. In this paper we question (a) the most important 
 use of static (solid basic structures on which bigger things can be built) to formally analyse risk; (b) the most important focus on risk disgust as the reason for (thinking about/when one thinks about) 
 risk and (c) the idea that clearly (related to the study of how likely or unlikely things are to happen) models are likely to be helpful to farmers in their decision making. We present/cause 
 the question: for a (not wanting to do anything dangerous) farmer, what is the extra value of a recommendation came/coming from a model that represents risk 
 disgust, compared to a model based on risk neutrality? The end/end result reached is that for the types of the decision problems 
 most commonly modelled by farming-based money-flow experts, the extra value of representing risk disgust is commonly very little.

 1. Introduction 
 Farmers face doubt about the money-based results of their actions due to their limited ability 
 to (describe the future) things such as weather, prices and (related to the body function of living things) responses to different farming practices. In recognising this feature of farming, studies facing risk 
 and doubt 1 are common in the farming-based money flow/money-based studies book-related. Risk is widely seen as an issue of 
 extreme importance to farmers' decision making and to 
 policies affecting those decisions (e.g. Anderson et al., 
 1977; Boussard, 1979; Anderson, 1982; Robison and 
 Barry, 1987).

 1 In this paper we use the terms 'risk' and 'uncertainty' interchangeably to mean 'uncertainty in consequences' (Antle, 1983; 
 Hardaker eta!., 1991). 
 
 Like most major areas of school-related effort/try, the 
 study of risk in farming has created a body of thinking which sometimes is challenged 
 (e.g. Antle, 1983; Leathers and Quiggin, 1991). Our 
 aim in this paper is to criticise some areas of this thinking about the practical incorporation of risk in farm management models. This paper is 
 not another opinion of (not definite) expected utility explanation and its different other choices (e.g. Machina, 1981, 
 1982; Buschena and Zilberman, 1994). Rather, the focus is on the use of risk models to analyse farm-related 
 problems. Some parts of the approaches used most 
 commonly in modelling risk are examined and the 
 uses and usefulness of these approaches in farming 
 is discussed. A reason of the resulting discussion is 
 that the appropriate level of detail and sophistication 
 in the modelling of farming-based risks depends on the 
 meant uses of the model. Three such uses are discussed and differences in the appropriate modelling 
 approach are highlighted.

 2. Goals of farm modelling 
 The design of a farm model is itself a decision problem involving risk, goals, and restrictions. The 
 choice depends on: (a) the closeness of job  deadlines; 
 (b) the availability, quality and cost of data and skilled 
 modellers; (c) the not important costs and benefits of extra 
 effort to enlarge or complicate the model and (d) uncertainties such as the extent to which the problem or 
 farming system may change during the construction of 
 the model. Further, the choice of modelling way of doing things 
 depends on the goals of the modeller, which may 
 include: (a) to publish in a refereed journal; (b) to support the government's decision making by (describing the future) 
 either farmer behaviour or changes in welfare in response to a change in, for example, government policy, 
 technology, prices or climate and (c) to help farmers 
 make decisions. In the following sections these goals are carefully thought about/believed in more detail and their relevance 
 to the modelling of farming-based risks is discussed. 
 
 3. Publishing 
 Suppose that the modeller' s goal is to publish 
 in an money-related journal an analysis of a farm management problem. For many, the solution to the decision problem organized and listed above is to develop a formal 
 math-related model of the problem, hopefully facing a topical or newly appearing issue, with doubt represented clearly. Commonly, the model represents 
 risk disgust as part of the farmer's goal, (related to careful studying or deep thinking) solutions are received/made from and formal ends/end results produced/showed from the results. 
 The needed thing for (related to careful studying or deep thinking) solutions often 
 causes the problem to be simplified (in a big way), 
 resulting in possibly extreme (detailed description of exactly what is required) errors 
 (Musser et al., 1986; Kingwell, 1996). The modelling 
 (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) can be (not definite) expected utility, for (even though there is the existence of) its admitted/recognized/responded to limits (Machina, 1981, 
 1982; Quiggin, 1982; Schoemaker, 1982; Just et al., 
 1990), it remains widely used and acceptable to most 
 reviewers and journal editors (Hardaker et al., 1991; 
 Bar-Shira, 1992). 
 The focus on math-related models is unfortunate 
 because in practice, testing the hits/effects of, and best responses to, risk is mostly a numbers game 
 (Preckel and DeVuyst, 1992). It is rarely possible to 
 
 generalise about the (quality of something that makes people like it or want it) or otherwise of a particular farming plan, since the numbers change/differ  widely 
 from one situation to another. For example, yield distributions differ across soil types, areas and crop 
 types (Stanford et al., 1994) and price distributions 
 differ by valuable thing and data period (Lapp and Smith, 
 1992). Babcock and Hennessy (1996) note that prices 
 and produces /gives up are often assumed to be (usually/ in a common and regular way) distributed 
 (e.g. Fraser, 1994; Lapan and Moschini, 1994) which 
 simplifies the analysis but is not agreeing with/not matching with evidence about the skewness of yields (Stanford et al., 1994) and with the non-negativity of yields 
 and prices. What's more, the relative importance of 
 price risk and production risk can change/differ  widely between different businesses/projects, different farming systems 
 and through time (Harris et al., 1974). 
 Factors such as climate, crop sicknesses, soil types, 
 crop species, crop-watering/rinsing with water, marketing policies and technology interact to form and change  the uncertainties of 
 different farming practices. Ignoring these many sources of doubt is very important in an math-related 
 analysis to secure/make sure of (ability to be managed or controlled), 2 yet it is a (detailed description of exactly what is required) error which can lead to false ends/end results. For 
 example, Pannell (1991) argued that the reputation 
 of bug-killers as 'risk-reducing' inputs was based mostly on studies which thought about/believed only doubt 
 about pest density and/or bug-killer effectiveness (e.g. 
 Feder, 1979; Carlson, 1984). If the uncertainties of 
 other factors such as price and possible yield were 
 carefully thought about/believed, bug-killers could be either risk-reducing 
 or risk-increasing. This argument has been supported 
 in later analyses (Leathers and Quiggin, 1991; 
 Horowitz and Lichtenberg, 1994a, b). 
 
 4. Supporting government decision making 
 If it is accepted that a number-based rather than an (related to careful studying or deep thinking) approach to modelling is necessary to support 
 government decision making, it still remains necessary to choose the level of detail to be modelled and 
 the modelling way of doing things (Anderson et al., 1977; Hazell 
 and Norton, 1986; Kennedy, 1986). These issues unavoidably require judgement over the benefits and costs 
 2 Robison and Barry (1987) note: "two random (numbers that change/things that change) ... 
 quickly complicate our analysis, forcing us into number-based rather 
 than detailed thinking approaches" (p. 110).

 of including parts of the decision problem in the 
 model (Anderson, 1982). The key judgements related 
 to risk are: 
 - Should the model's time frame be static or energetic? 
 - If energetic, should the model allow for strategical decision making, based on updated information in each 
 time period? 
 - Should risk disgust be represented? 
 4.1. Relative importance of representing strategical 
 changes/recalculations and risk disgust 
 Most studies of risk in money flow/money-based studies and farming-based 
 money flow/money-based studies have put into use the static (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) and included risk disgust in the decision maker's goal 
 function (e.g. Sandmo, 1971; Feder, 1979). In these 
 studies, risk or doubt matters, because decision 
 makers effort/try to move away from plans with 
 (compared to other things) high variance of income towards plans 
 with (compared to other things) low variance, if necessary at the cost 
 of some reduction in expected income. 
 Most farmers would be confused that as a control/field of study 
 we focus so much on this aspect of risk management. 
 For them, the main issue raised by (quality of changing over time or at different places) of price 
 and production is how to respond strategically and energetically/changing quickly as needed to unfolding opportunities or threats to create added/more income or to avoid losses (i.e. how to 
 respond to thembedded risk'). For example, Ortmann 
 et al. (1992) found that the information farmers desire 
 for risk management is mostly concerned with defining the expected result, not with avoiding risk per 
 se. Such information allows farmers to respond (in a money-making way) to differences/different versions in prices or climate and so is attractive even to 'risk-neutral' farmers, meaning those, 
 
 whose goal is to (make as big as possible) expected (money made/good thing received). Maybe in recognition of this, there is a growing books that stresses the need to think about  the energetic and 
 strategical features of farming (Rae, 1971; Antle, 1983; 
 Schroeder and Featherstone, 1990; Taylor, 1993). 
 A few separate (random/including random data points) programming studies 
 have represented both strategical farm management 
 responses and risk disgust (Schroeder and Featherstone, 1990; Featherstone et al., 1993; Kingwell, 
 1994; Pannell and Nordblom, 1998), allowing the 
 possibility of examining the relative importance of 
 including strategies and risk disgust in the models. For 
 example, Kingwell et al. (1993) found that the expected farm (money made/good thing received) in a area of Western Australia 
 could be increased by over 20% through appropriate 
 strategical changes/recalculations of farm plans, while Kingwell 
 (1994) showed that when risk disgust was included 
 in analyses of this farming system, best expected 
 (money made/good thing received) fell by only 2-6%. The results in Table 1 are 
 from best solutions of the same model 3 with or 
 without representation of risk disgust and with or 
 without representation of strategical options. The utility making the most of solutions employ a Pratt-Arrow risk 
 disgust coefficient of 3.0x 10-6 which would be 
 thought about/believed very high for this area based on 
 published evidence (e.g. Bond and Wonder, 
 1980; Poetsley and HmTis, 1987). The increase in 
 expected (money made/good thing received) from strategical changes/recalculations is 10-12%, 
 whereas the reduction in expected (money made/good thing received) given risk 
 disgust is less than 3%. 
 
 3 The model is a separate (random/including random data points) programming model of a 
 representative farm. Risk disgust is represented using a method 
 almost the same as  DEMP (Lambert and McCarl, 1985) and UEP (Patten 
 et a!., 1988).

 In examining the relative importance of representing strategies or risk disgust, the most (connected/related) comparison is of sure feeling equal 4 values for the solutions 
 (Table 2). In calculating these sure feeling equals, it 
 is assumed that the farmer is (not wanting to do anything dangerous) (total risk 
 disgust=3.0x w- 6 ). The hit/effect of risk disgust is 
 even less than suggested by results in Table 1, with 
 sure feeling equals changing by less than 1%. Compared to the ideal model that includes risk disgust 
 and strategical options, a model which did not represent strategies would have identified a solution around 
 $12,000 per year less valuable to the farmer. Very differently, the loss of sure feeling equal from accepting a 
 recommended plan that does not think about/believe risk disgust would have been only $1000 or less. 
 While it is admitted/recognized/responded to that presentation of interesting results does not provide a general proof, it is 
 stressed that: 
 1. This model represents a farming system with high 
 levels of price and production risk. 
 2. The results (state that something is much bigger, worse, etc., than it really is) the importance of risk disgust by using a risk disgust coefficient which is 
 in a silly way high for most farmers in the area. 
 3. The results are easily explainable (see below) and 
 are agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with all other number-based examples of 
 which we are aware. 
 4. The results are agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with the attitudes of farmers, as talked about/said earlier. 
 
 4 The 'certainty equal' is the dollar value to a (not wanting to do anything dangerous) 
 person of the risky result of an investment. It is less than the 
 expected value of (money made/good thing received) or income from the investment due to the 
 deduction of a 'risk premium' which increases with the level of 
 risk and with the person's degree of risk disgust. 
 
 Overall, our reading of the available (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) is 
 that the (popular things/general ways things are going) obvious in Table 2 are, if not general, 
 at least very common. The first (or most important) reason for 
 the low hit/effect of risk disgust lies in the (state of not responding to anything) of sure feeling equal to changes in farm 
 management within the area of the best. This 
 is directly just like a classic result in analysis 
 of response to inputs, such as fertilisers. Differences/different versions 
 in management practices within the area of the 
 best make little difference to the level of net 
 benefits because the profit function is fiat near the 
 best (Anderson, 1975). Because of this flatness, 
 (serious thought/something to think about/respect) of difficulties such as risk disgust, 
 which only change the best plan by medium-level 
 amounts, does not greatly affect farmer welfare. So, 
 the argument is not that risk disgust does not affect 
 the farmer's best plan, but that the hit/effect of the 
 changes on farmer welfare is small. This is likely to 
 be true for any choice involving a continuous or about continuous decision (number or thing that changes) (e.g. areas 
 planted, input levels, stocking rates, feeding plans 
 and investment in futures contracts). It may be less 
 true for large separate choices such as decisions on 
 (instance of buying something for money) of land or large machinery. 
 Representation of strategical changes/recalculations makes a 
 greater difference to the sure feeling equal because 
 the main benefits of strategical changes/recalculations happen in the 
 extreme years, both good and bad. In these years 
 the best management practices are very different 
 to the best practices for most years, mainly due 
 to hits/effects on expected (money made/good thing received), rather than risk. The 
 differences in plan in extreme years are usually 
 larger than those caused/brought about/reminded by risk disgust alone, often to the extent that sure feeling equal is sensitive 
 to the change.

 Nordblom (1998). 
 
 To illustrate further the low hit/effect of representing risk disgust on the value of a model's recommended plan, Fig. 1 shows the results of 
 mis-specifying a producer's risk disgust coefficient 
 in a representative farm model in north-west Syria 
 (Pannell and Nordblom, 1998). 
 Each line in Fig. 1 represents the sure feeling equal value of income for a possible Syrian farmer 
 with a utility function seen as constant relative risk disgust. The different lines represent farmers 
 with different levels of relative risk disgust (RRA). 
 Moving from left to right along a line corresponds 
 to different combinations of businesses/projects and practices 
 identified as best by models of increasing risk disgust. On each line, at only one point does the risk disgust coefficient of the model go along with/match up to that of the 
 farmer and, at this point, the sure feeling equal value 
 to that farmer of the plan recommended by the model 
 is (made as big as possible). All other models recommend a plan of 
 lower value. The most striking aspect of the figure is 
 the flatness of the lines, reflecting that the sure feeling 
 equal value of a farm model's recommended plan 
 is insensitive to the degree of risk disgust used to get the plan. If a (not wanting to do anything dangerous) farmer put into use a 
 plan which would be best for a risk-neutral farmer, 
 the level of possible utility previous/unavoidable by the farmer 
 would be small. This is made clearer in Table 3, which 
 shows the loss of potential sure feeling equal for different farmers from putting into use the recommendations 
 
 of a risk-neutral model. As expected, the cost increases with the degree of risk disgust of the farmer. 
 However, even at the highest level of risk disgust 
 (RRA=3.2), the cost in sure feeling (almost-equal state) of ignoring risk disgust is less than 2%. Although, risk 
 disgust coefficients of Syrian farmers have not been 
 guessed, on the basis of other studies in developing countries (e.g. Binswanger, 1980; Antle, 1987) we 
 would expect that for most Syrian farmers the cost of 
 ignoring risk disgust when selecting a plan would be 
 less than 1%. The small value of this cost is even more 
 surprising given that (related to the Earth's weather) risks faced by Syrian 
 farmers are among the highest in the world (Nguyen, 
 1989). 
 (see/hear/become aware of) that although sure feeling equal is insensitive to farm plan, it is sensitive to the risk disgust coefficient, as reflected in the distances between 
 the lines in Fig. 1. It is not claimed that (not wanting to do anything dangerous) 
 farmers are little affected by risk. If that were true, the 
 lines in Fig. 1 would lie close together. The argument 
 here rests on the lines' flatness, not their separation. 
 The flatness reflects the scientific result that the (able to be done) and best extent of risk avoidance is (compared to other things) 
 small. 
 A third example from a different situation is presented in Table 4 which shows findings for a weed control problem in a area of Western Australia (Pannell, 
 1995). The model selects best herbicide dosages 
 for a representative farm. Even when the importance 
 of risk disgust is (made to appear much bigger, worse, etc., than it really is) by assuming perfect 
 relationship between yields on each hectare and by assuming a relative risk disgust coefficient of 3.2, the 
 cost of using a risk-neutral model is less than 1%. For 
 more realistic ideas (you think are true) it is less than 0.1 %.

 Some farm modelling studies that think about/believe strategies 
 and risk disgust identify risk disgust as an important influence on farm management (Schroeder and 
 Featherstone, 1990; Featherstone et al., 1993). However, these studies do not ask the question that we 
 have talked to/looked at above: to what extent does (changing to make better/changing to fit new conditions) 
 farm management in response to risk disgust increase 
 farmer welfare. They also do not face/deal with the issue of 
 the relative importance of including strategies against/compared to/or risk 
 disgust. For example, Featherstone et al. (1993) described a representative Indiana farm and examined 
 best capital structures using a separate (random/including random data points) 
 programming creation. Some of their results are 
 reproduced in Table 5.

 When the farm has an initial (money owed)  to valuable thing ratio of 
 40% risk disgust has little hit/effect on the sure feeling 
 equal of the once-a-year return to initial equity. At 
 an initial (money owed)  to valuable thing ratio of 70% risk disgust has 
 a greater effect in reducing the sure feeling equal. 
 However, recall from the earlier results, that it would 
 be a lie to think that sure feeling equal being 
 sensitive to risk disgust necessarily hints that a 
 model with risk disgust creates much more 
 valuable recommendations than a risk-neutral model. 
 Failure to recognise this lie is a cause of some 
 farming-based money-flow experts over-rating the importance of 
 modelling risk disgust. Anyway, it is true that 
 many studies have found that farm activity selections 
 were affected by the degree of risk disgust (Hazell 
 et al., 1983; Chavas and Holt, 1990; Schroeder and 
 Featherstone, 1990; Kingwell, 1994). There is no weird statement here. The explanation lies in the flatness of the 
 sure feeling equal curves, as organized and listed earlier. So, 
 the importance of representing risk disgust depends 
 very much on the goals of the study. Risk disgust will be (compared to other things) more important in studies with 
 an goal of (describing the future) behavioural responses to a 
 change, rather than of testing-related welfare hits/effects or 
 making recommendations to farmers. 
 Even for (describe the future)ive purposes, however, there are reasons to believe that representation of risk disgust is 
 not as important as often showed/represented in the books. In 
 some studies, the hit/effect of risk disgust on best 
 management is (made to appear much bigger, worse, etc., than it really is) by (a) using sillyly 
 high risk disgust coefficients; (b) failure to represent 
 farm restrictions and technology realistically (Musser, 
 McCarl, and Smith) and/or (c) modelling individual 
 businesses/projects without (thinking about/when one thinks about) their degree of relationship with other businesses/projects or decisions. In some 
 studies, with or without these failings, the hit/effect of 
 risk disgust on behaviour has been found to be low 
 (e.g. Smidts, 1990). Finally, even when risk disgust 
 does truly affect management, its effects may still be 
 small in relation to those of other factors that may be 
 thought about/believed for including in something in the model. 
 Often, better representation of the (study of living things/qualities of living things), production other choices, technology, taxation results/consequences, 
 useful thing/valuable supply gifts, weather-year and price conditions, and strategical oppmtunities will produce more 
 valuable information about change at the farm-level 
 than fancy (or smart) including in something of risk disgust. Overall, 
 we decide that if a farm management model is to 
 
 D.J. Pannell et a!. I Farming-based Money flow 23 (2000) 69-78 
 
 be built to (describe the future) or test change at the 
 farm-level, then including in something of risk disgust is often of 
 secondary importance. This is not to deny that farmers are (not wanting to do anything dangerous) (Bond and Wonder, 1980; Antle, 
 1987; Poetsley and Harris, 1987; Myers, 1989), nor 
 to claim that risk disgust has no hit/effect on welfare 
 or behaviour. Rather, the (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) is that if we wish 
 to test a model by its ability to (describe the future) and test change, then in many situations the net benefits of 
 using modelling useful things/valuable supplies to represent risk disgust 
 are less that the net benefits of using the useful things/valuable supplies to 
 improve other parts of the model. This echoes the 
 feelings of Sonka (1983): 
 Our concentration on risk [aversion] as a source of 
 non-profit-making the most of behavior may have led us off 
 the main trail. A few factors including production 
 restrictions, many goals and lack of information 
 could cause farmers to make non-profit-making the most of 
 decisions. We should be worried about testing 
 the hits/effects of these factors, not just the presence 
 of risk. (p. 202). 
 One cost of leaving out/keeping out risk disgust from a farm 
 management model, would be that the model would 
 not give due weight to the risk-reducing benefits of 
 (getting involved with different types of things; not sticking with only one thing). A traditional view is that (getting involved with different types of things; not sticking with only one thing) is a key risk management plan (Samuelson, 
 1967). By creating income from a few activities 
 whose returns are not perfectly related, a farmer 
 can reduce the overall income variance. Sometimes, 
 the failure to represent risk is referred to/is given a ticket as a reason why 
 outputs from some mathematical programming models of farms are not as (branched out/done different things) as the actual farms 
 they represent. 
 However, best farm plans for risk-neutral and 
 (not wanting to do anything dangerous) farmers can be (in almost the same way) (branched out/done different things) (Brink 
 and McCarl, 1978; Kingwell, 1994) since risk disgust is only one of some possible (rewards or reasons for doing something) 
 for (getting involved with different types of things; not sticking with only one thing). Reasons for (getting involved with different types of things; not sticking with only one thing) by the 
 risk-neutral farmer include: 
 1. Non-evenness and equality of useful thing/valuable supply quality. For example, 
 on large farms with different areas and types of 
 soil the money-making ability of crop or (area of grassy land) other choices 
 differ according to soil type leading to a mix of 
 businesses/projects across the farm (Morrison et al., 1986; 
 Kingwell et al., 1992). 
 2. useful thing/valuable supply restrictions. In the short run, limits on 
 machinery ability (to hold or do something) joined with yield reductions 
 from later causing/producing affect the best size of crop- 
 
 75 
 
 ping programs and may result in a mixture of enterplises. (in almost the same way), labour supply and demand at 
 particular times through the year may prevent a 
 high concentration of other useful things/valuable supplies in a particular business/project. 
 3. Complementarities or positive interactions between businesses/projects. These include benefits of particular rotational sequences (e.g. nitrogen constant thought 
 by (peas, beans, lentils, etc.), disease control, weed control, soil 
 structure and soil organic matter content), and 
 (things that are given/work that's done) of crop residues to animals diets 
 (Pannell, 1987). Because of this, the failure of some mathematical programming models to select (branched out/done different things) 
 farm plans is at least as likely to be due to their 
 failure to do enough to represent very important (related to the body function of living things) 
 or physical (features/ qualities/ traits) of the farming system 
 as their (when something is kept out or not included) of risk disgust. 
 Pre-decided whole-farm models, such as MIDAS 5 (Kingwell and Pannell, 1987), which do 
 represent these features can select plans which 
 are highly (branched out/done different things), with risk-reduction as an 
 unplanned-for bonus. 
 Think about/believe, then, the possibility that choosing to build 
 a model without any representation of risk or doubt may be best when the not important benefits and 
 costs of modelling effort are fully tested. The useful things/valuable supplies saved by not clearly representing risk can 
 be used to (a) represent other, more important, aspects 
 of the farming system; (b) improve the quality of data 
 in the model; (c) conduct more long/big model testing; (d) apply the model sooner and more often and 
 (e) construct added/more versions of the model for different purposes. An added advantage is that pre-decided models are much easier to test and maintain 
 because of their smaller size. Risk and doubt 
 may still be thought about/believed in any analysis by the use of 
 sensitivity analysis to (ask lots of questions about/try to find the truth about) separate pictures/situations of 
 interest (Pannell, 1997). 
 One situation which may weigh heavily against development of a pre-decided model is where the meant audience for the modelling results perceive that 
 clearly representing risk is of extreme importance. 
 In this case, clear representation of risk, risk aver5 'Deterministic' models have no clear representation of chances related to risk or doubt. Limits/guidelines are specified as 
 fixed, best-bet or mean values. MIDAS stands for model of an 
 integrated dryland farming-based system.

 sian and/or strategical responses to risk may increase the 
 believability of the model (good or well enough) to warrant the effort involved, ignoring their hit/effect on the value 
 of the results. 
 
 5. Helping farmer decision making 
 A final reason for building a farm model is to 
 aid farmer decision-making. Farmers make many 
 decisions against the background of two key goals. 
 The first is that most farmers wish to stay in farming (even though there is the existence of) the shocks of price and weather and the 
 changes in policy, technology and social conditions 
 that show farming. The second is that farmers wish 
 to increase their wealth over time. The keys to (accomplishing or gaining) these goals are to get right the big decisions, 
 such as those on land (instance of buying something for money), machinery investment and useful thing/valuable supply improvement (Malcolm, 1994) and 
 to make correct major strategical changes/recalculations (K.ingwell 
 et al., 1993). 
 This end/end result is supported, for Australia at least, 
 by farm survey (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) (Ripley and Kingwell, 1984; 
 Edwards, 1994). The farmers most likely to be under 
 acute money shortage at any time are those who bought 
 land or machinery at the wrong time or at the wrong 
 price or who made significant and wrong major changes/recalculations to their farm operations. Because of this, it is not the 
 everyday or even once-a-year risk management decisions 
 that are likely to importantly affect farm ability to be done. Surprisingly, the important long-run, major decisions are 
 mostly ignored in the risk books, which focuses 
 mainly on decisions about input levels and output 
 (mixes of stocks, bonds, etc./document collections). 
 In developing models for use by farmers, the question of appropriate complex difficulty and sophistication is 
 central. The reality of farming is complex. Pattern of behavior, 
 (random/including random data points), (related to the body function of living things), technical, (money-related) and human 
 factors interact in a way that will probably never be 
 incorporated fully in any mathematical model of farming-based decision analysis. Interestingly, however, "the 
 elaborate decision (related to careful studying or deep thinking) methods such as those 
 supported in the decision explanation and systems books are not much use in practice in the very complex 
 and uncertain situation of the farm business, while 
 the straight-forward farm management budgets are 
 very useful" (Malcolm, 1994, p. 21 ). Patrick 
 and DeVuyst (1995) also focuse the limits 
 
 of fancy (or smart) risk modelling ways of doing things for most 
 farmers, pointing out that there is much more 
 risk-related research information available than is 
 being included into extension programs. 
 The reality of farm management, which farmers understand well, is that, it is better to solve the whole 
 problem roughly than to attempt to solve part of the 
 problem very well. The advantage of simple money-planning approaches to farm planning is that, at least at 
 some level, it helps (serious thought/something to think about/respect) of all (connected/related) 
 (features/ qualities/ traits) of the (like nothing else) farm business (e.g. business/project interactions, restrictions, personal preferences, 
 attitudes, abilities and experiences). Use of sensitivity analysis to examine separate key pictures/situations and 
 identify break-even facts or conditions (that surround someone) are simple but valuable methods of including risk in this decision process, both from the point of view of risk disgust and 
 strategical changes/recalculations. The ways of doing things are simple and old, yet they provide the farmer with an opportunity to see  the nature and possible result of 
 uncertainties in a way that (helps increase/shows in a good way) (reasonable/showing good judgment) management of risk. They can take by force/take control of (good) enough detail, sometimes completely/in a hinting way, so that the value of the information 
 created for the farmer is higher than could be created by a less good, more partial and more unknown 
 fancy (or smart) risk model. 
 
 6. Ending/deciding comments 
 We are not arguing that farmers are risk-neutral, 
 that farming is free of risk, nor that (getting involved with different types of things; not sticking with only one thing) is 
 ineffective as a risk-reducing plan. Nor is the paper about the truth/trueness of decision explanation, (not definite) 
 expected utility explanation or any other way of doing things or explanation. We are not arguing against research to understand 
 human behaviour. Rather, the focus of this paper is 
 on the applied usefulness and value of other choice approaches to decision analysis. 
 A (thing that's given/work that's done) of the paper is to present/cause a question 
 that appears to have been (not there; not present) from the books 
 on risk in farming: for a (not wanting to do anything dangerous) farmer, what 
 is the extra value of a recommendation came/coming from 
 a model that represents risk disgust, compared to a 
 model based on risk neutrality? For many examples, 
 the answer seems to be, very little. 
 Certainly the study of risk and its effects/results/suggestions for 
 farm management is naturally interesting, challeng- 
 
 D.J. Pannell et a!. I Farming-based Money flow 23 (2000) 69-78 
 
 ing and now often publishable. However, a critical test of the books shows/tells about that the aspects 
 of farming-based risk most commonly researched and 
 published often are issues of secondary importance in 
 deciding/figuring out how farms are managed. The models and 
 results of much current risk management research 
 are not easily related to farmers. There is a need 
 for our control/field of study to test the needs of our audiences 
 more carefully.
