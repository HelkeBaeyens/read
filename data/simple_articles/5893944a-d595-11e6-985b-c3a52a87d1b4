 Abstract 
 This paper examines the relative money-based (wasting very little while working or producing something) of small and large rice farms in Cote d'Ivoire using a profit function approach. No 
 differences in the relative money-based (wasting very little while working or producing something) of small and large farms were found. This end/end result is strong under different model 
 (detailed descriptions of exactly what is required). Land-related changes directed towards further concentration of landholding for large farms in Cote d'Ivoire cannot be reasonable 
 based on money-based (wasting very little while working or producing something). Results show that access to credit and use of modem rice varieties increase (a lot) (money made/good things received). To improve 
 technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) of rice farms, an fast program to provide information, credit, improved seeds and other inputs is needed. When 
 all the farms (i.e. large and small) are taken together, there is (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) of allocative inefficiency. Plans are needed to remove such 
 management related inefficiencies in rice production either through the development of a better market price information system or effective 
 farmer-oriented technical training programs by rice extension workers. 
 
 1. Introduction 
 
 Farming-based policy makers in developing countries face hard decisions in their choice of land-related structure to (accomplish or gain with effort) the dual goals of growth and 
 equity in the farming-based part/area (Dorner, 1972; Khan 
 and Maki, 1979; Noronha, 1985; Lele and Clear jellywal, 
 1989; Deininger and Binswanger, 1995). Often, 
 land-related policies favor large farms under the thought (made beforehand) that they are more (money-based)/cheaply (producing a lot with very little waste) 
 than small farms (Dorner, 1972; Khan and Maki,

 1979; Kydd and Christiansen, 1982; Lele and Clear jellywal, 1989; Kouadio and Pokou, 1991; Deininger and 
 Binswanger, 1995). A few attempts have been made 
 in Africa to encourage large scale farms. Examples 
 include policies favoring collectivized farming that 
 ruled production relations in Tanzania in the 
 1970s (McHenry, 1979); state-(forced (on people)/caused an inconvenient situation) (length of time at work or in power/right to permanent employment) (changing from one form, state, or state of mind to another) arrangements in Kenya that led to further 
 land combining, concentration and (making something unimportant) of small farms (Brokensha and Glazier, 1973; 
 Njeru, 1978; Okoth-Ogendo, 1986); diversion of institutional credit to large farms in Kenya and Malawi 
 (Kydd and Christiansen, 1982; Lele and Meyers, 
 1986); subsidization of land settlement, crop-watering/rinsing with water 
 and mechanization costs in Nigeria (Lele et al., 
 1989); policy-caused land, labor and output market

 helping actions to favor large (related to Europe) farms over 
 African smallholder farms in Kenya, Zimbabwe and 
 South Africa (Deininger and Binswanger, 1995) or 
 (serving to severely limit or control) market (using different things) that gave large farms 
 legal rights to grow clearly stated/particular crops for export in 
 Malawi (Christiansen and Kydd, 1987). 
 The assumed superior money-based (wasting very little while working or producing something) of 
 large farms may, however, be misleading due to the 
 high social costs of the special (and good) public policies 
 that have maintained them. Experiences with most 
 large-farm led land-related changes within dual farm size 
 structures have been mixed (Lele and Clear jellywal, 1989; 
 Collier et al., 1990; Bruce and Migot-Adholla, 1994). 
 Deininger and Binswanger (1995) suggest that incorporating rent looking (for) behavior in the explanation of production relations may explain the existence of such 
 dual farm size structures in Kenya, Zimbabwe and 
 South Africa. Policies that were used to reduce the 
 'reservation utility' of the African smallholder farms 
 in these countries included (serving to severely limit or control) land, labor and 
 output market rules. Without these 
 policy distortions, large (related to Europe) farms could not 
 have been competitive with the African smallholder 
 farms. Lele and Clear jellywal (1989) compared domestic 
 useful thing/valuable supply costs for the production of coffee and tea in 
 Kenya for large and smallholder farms. Their guesses showed a strong (serving to compare two or more things) advantage in 
 smallholder production, and they argued that this 
 possibly explains why the colonial government forced restrictions on smallholder farms producing 
 tea and coffee in Kenya. However, Lele and Clear jellywal 
 (1989) and Deininger and Binswanger (1995) and 
 did not specifically test for money-based (i.e. price and 
 technical) (wasting very little while working or producing something) differences between the large 
 and small farms in their intelligent analyses. 
 Previous studies in Asia have tested for relative 
 (wasting very little while working or producing something) differences by farm size, with disagreeing 
 results. Lau and Yotopoulos (1971) and Yotopoulos 
 and Lau (1973) found that small wheat farms in the 
 Indian Punjab were more (money-based)/cheaply (producing a lot with very little waste) than 
 large farms. In Pakistan, Khan and Maki ( 1979) 
 found that large farms were more (money-based)/cheaply (producing a lot with very little waste) than small farms. However, these results are at 
 variance with those of Sidhu (1974) who found no 
 (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) of differences in the relative money-based 
 (wasting very little while working or producing something) or its parts/pieces of technical and pricing 
 (wasting very little while working or producing something), between small and large farms. The above 
 suggests the need to avoid (big statements based on very little information) on what is 
 
 clearly a complex issue. Because of major differences 
 in farming-based and institutional settings, (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) 
 from the previously-mentioned studies in Asia cannot be 
 used directly for informing land-related policy in Africa. 
 However, there is a low amount of studies in Africa that 
 test for relative money-based (wasting very little while working or producing something) (Saleem, 1988) 
 by farm size in order to guide policy decision makers. Data limits have mostly prevented such 
 analysis, most especially in West Africa (Lele and 
 Clear jellywal, 1989). The goal of this paper is to test 
 for relative money-based (wasting very little while working or producing something) differences between 
 small and large rice farms in Cote d 'Ivoire using the 
 profit function approach. The purpose of this paper 
 is different from that of Deininger and Binswanger 
 ( 1995), in that while they focused on creating 
 reasonable guesses for the existence of dual farm 
 size land-related structures, our aim is to decide/figure out 
 whether differences in money-based (wasting very little while working or producing something) by farm 
 size exist in Cote d'Ivoire, the existence of dual farm 
 size land-related structure taken as given (Widner, 1993). 
 There is an on-going debate in Cote d'Ivoire on 
 the types of institutional changes needed to stimulate 
 rice production in the country (Cooperation Fran&#126;aise 
 de Developpement, 1993). With (lowering in number/getting worse) national 
 rice independence, Cote d'Ivoire has become the 
 second largest importer of rice in West Africa (average of 284200 t every year in 1988-1990) (West 
 Africa Rice Development Association, 1993). This 
 has again led some policy makers to argue in favor 
 of increasing domestic production through the encouragement of large farms. The argument for such 
 an approach is that it lowers extension and input 
 distribution costs, and secures/makes sure of easier and lower marketing costs with fewer producers. Although about 
 80% of rice farms in the country are smallholder 
 farms, the government has over the years encouraged 
 large farms through the importation and distribution 
 of highly helped pay for mechanized equipment, seed 
 and chemical inputs. For example, the government 
 established large, fully mechanized, and highly helped pay for upland rice farms in the northern part of the 
 country. The state has also given special (and good) tax 
 (permissions to not do something) for the import of large machinery 
 (Kouadio and Pokou, 1991). The lack of scientific 
 studies on the relative money-based (wasting very little while working or producing something) of large 
 and small farms in Cote d'Ivoire makes it hard 
 for policy makers in Cote d'Ivoire to test their 
 land-related policy for (accomplishing or gaining) growth and equity.

 2. Scientific analysis 
 2.1. Scientific model 
 Using the output price as the numeraire, the (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy)ized restricted profit function ( 1T *(q, Z)) can be 
 written in a generalized form as 
 7T 
 
 *( 
 
 q,Z) 
 
 = 
 
 F[ X 1* ( q,Z) ... ,Xn* ( q,Z)]_) 
 m 
 
 - L 
 j&#126; 
 
 (1) 
 
 qjX/ ( q,Z) 
 I 
 
 where q. represents the (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy)ized factor prices, F 
 is a well behaved production function, X is the 
 vector of changeable inputs and Z is the vector of fixed 
 inputs used in the production process. Starting with 
 any well specified (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy)ized restricted profit function, direct application of Hottelings-Shephard' s 
 Lemmas to the function yields the similar 
 factor demand and output supply equations 
 
 j= 1, ... ,m 
 
 (2) 
 
 Multiplying both sides by q/1T * gives a series of 
 
 m factor share equations 
 
 ( 37T * ( q,Z)jaqJ 
 
 =-X/ q/7T *=a./ 
 (3) 
 
 j=1, ... ,m 
 
 Eqs. (1) and (3) form a possible basis for the 
 (detailed descriptions of exactly what is required) of the scientific models. Following 
 Lau and Yotopoulos ( 1971 ), the scientific (detailed description of exactly what is required) of the system of equations of the (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy)ized 
 restricted profit function and the factor share equations is given as

 used including family and hired labor; w 1 is the 
 wage rate (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy)ized by the price of output; w 2 is 
 the price of (material that makes plants grow better) (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy)ized by the price of 
 paddy; X 2 is the amount of (material that makes plants grow better) used; Z 1 is the 
 capital input and is the sum of costs of seeds, 
 insecticides, herbicides, animal and mechanical 
 power; Z 2 is the land input, which is the net area 
 spread around to rice in hectares; DL is a dummy (number or thing that changes) 
 taking on the value of togetherness for large farms; Ds is a 
 dummy (number or thing that changes) taking on the value of togetherness for 
 small farms; R 1 is a district dummy 1- Other (numbers that change/things that change) included in the profit function equation are use 
 of improved rice varieties ( MV ), whether or not the 
 farmer is educated (EDUC: defined as having had at 
 least 6 years of education, the least needed/demanded for 
 reading and writing ability in the country), contact with extension (EXT) 
 and access to credit (CRDT). Including education in the profit function comes from the findings 
 of earlier studies (Sidhu and Baanate, 1981; Jamison 
 and Lau, 1982; Pudasaini, 1983) that education has a 
 positive effect on (money made/good things received), a result that points to/shows the 
 existence of management related inefficiency (Ali 
 and Byerlee, 1991). Including in something of the extension (number or thing that changes) in the profit function follows studies that have 
 shown that extension contacts by farmers have a 
 positive influence on their farm management ability 
 and technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) (Bindlish and Evenson, 
 1993). The use of modem varieties (MV) is expected to have a positive effect on (money made/good things received) given the 
 higher working well potentials of these varieties 
 (Sidhu, 1974). 
 It is assumed that the errors of the system of 
 equations are (serving to add something) with zero mean and limited 
 variance. For the same farm, the co-variance of the 
 error terms in these equations are non-zero, while the 
 co-variance of error terms of any of the equations for 
 different farms is assumed to be zero. Given these 
 ideas (you think are true), and following previous studies (Y otopoulos and Lau, 1973; Sidhu, 1974; Saleem, 1988), 
 Zellner's (appearing to be) unrelated moving backward (SUR) 
 
 i= 1,2 
 where 1T * is the (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy)ized (money made/good thing received) in FCFA (FCFA 
 520 = $US1), defined as money/money income less changeable costs 
 (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy)ized by the price of paddy ( p ); A* is the 
 intercept; X 1 is the number of man-days of labor 
 
 1 Combining of date across areas to improve price (quality of changing over time or at different places) in 
 data sets has priority in a few of the studies on profit 
 function applications (Lau and Yotopoulos, 1971; Tamin, 1979; 
 Lau et a!., 1979). As in previous studies we introduce a (related to a large area) 
 dummy (number or thing that changes).

 method was used to guess the system of equations 
 in order to get asymptotically (producing a lot with very little waste) limit/guideline 
 guesses. The (wasting very little while working or producing something) of the guesses can be 
 further improved by forcing appropriate restrictions on the limits/guidelines in the system of equations. 
 
 2.2. Data 
 Data used to guess the model were collected 
 from August 1992 to April 1993 from a sample of 
 410 rice farms in villages in three districts of northem Cote d'Ivoire, namely Touba (67 farms), Korhogo (216 farms) and Katiola (127 farms). This 
 gave/given us with disaggregated micro-level data 2 - 
 The definition of farm size has been (number or thing that changes) in the 
 (wasting very little while working or producing something) books, as what is carefully thought about/believed 'large' or 
 'small' is relative depending on the farming-based system settings. In Pakistan farming, Khan and Maki 
 ( 1979) classified large farms as those having 12.5 
 areas of land or over (i.e. 5 ha). Using Indian data, Yotopoulos and Lau (1973) and Sidhu (1974) classified 
 'large' farms as those with at least 10 areas of land (i.e. 4 
 ha). In this study, large farms were defined as farms 
 that have at least 5 ha. In their study in northern Cote 
 d'Ivoire, Kouadio and Pokou (1991) noted that average farm size of the large farms ranged from 5 to 28 
 ha, with a mean of 10 ha. To decide/figure out the strength of ends/end results from the first analysis, we will 
 also examine the effects of re-defining the dividing line 
 for large farms to 10 ha. Sensitivity of the ends/end results to alternate definitions of the dividing line, although very important given the potential (affecting lots of things in many ways for a long time) effects/results/suggestions of the results of farm (wasting very little while working or producing something) 
 tests, is rarely tested (Khan and Maki, 1979). 
 
 2 The use of data from the districts also improved (quality of changing over time or at different places) in 
 the price data. We find the well-said argument of Sevilla-Siero 
 (1991) (p. 125) highly (connected/related) here: "[A]s soon as we bring into 
 the analysis (related to space or existing in space) (things to carefully think about) (and farming in most developing countries is par excellence a (related to where mountains, rivers, cities, etc., are located) broke up activity) we see locational differences in fanngate prices ....Thus depending on their location, farms will argue with different groups of output and input prices. Surprisingly, it is the wide 
 (land-area-based/location) breaking up/spreading out (typical and expected) of developing country farming (and the (land-area-based/location) price variablity caused by it) that 
 makes/gives (able to be done) the guess of (money made/good thing received) functions (in there/within that)". 
 
 3. Scientific results 
 
 3.1. Guess testing 
 The guessed results of the profit function and 
 factor share equations for the (wasting very little while working or producing something) tests are 
 given in Table 1. The limit/guideline guesses all have 
 the expected signs. The input prices all have the 
 possibly expected negative signs pointing to/showing that 
 the guessed profit function is curving out in input prices. 
 The coefficient on capital input is positive as expected, which agrees with the finding of Khan and 
 Maki (1979). In the model of Yotopoulos and Lau 
 (1973), the coefficient on the capital (number or thing that changes) was 
 found to be negatively signed due to what the authors described as mis-(detailed description of exactly what is required) of this (number or thing that changes). 
 Although extension (EXT) and education (EDUC) 
 positively influence (makes money/gets something good), their effects are not significant. However, access to credit (CRDT) and use 
 of modem varieties ( MV) are positively related to 
 (money made/good things received) and are usually significant. 
 (wasting very little while working or producing something) has three parts/pieces: technical, allocative and money-based. Technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) can be 
 defined as the ability to (accomplish or gain with effort) a higher level of 
 output, given a almost the same  level of production inputs. 
 Allocative (wasting very little while working or producing something) defines the extent to which 
 farmers make (producing a lot with very little waste) decisions by using inputs up 
 to the level at which their not important (thing that's given/work that's done) to 
 output value is equal to the factor cost. Money-based 
 (wasting very little while working or producing something) combines technical and allocative (wasting very little while working or producing something). Technical and allocative (wasting very little while working or producing something) are necessary, and when they happen together are (good) enough 
 conditions for (accomplishing or gaining) money-based (wasting very little while working or producing something). In order to deal with the/to speak to the  questions of relative (wasting very little while working or producing something) 
 discussed above, we carried out the following (related to studying numbers) tests: 
 H1: small and large rice farms have equal relative 
 money-based (wasting very little while working or producing something); 
 H2: there is equal relative price (wasting very little while working or producing something) with 
 respect to labor and (material that makes plants grow better) for small and large 
 rice farms; 
 H3: there is equal relative technical and price 
 (wasting very little while working or producing something) for small and large rice farms; 
 H4: if either H1 or H2 is rejected, H4 tests for 
 total price (wasting very little while working or producing something) of the large farms; 
 H5: if either H1 or H2 is rejected, H5 tests for 
 total price (wasting very little while working or producing something) of the small farms; 
 
 A.A. Adesina, K.K. Djato /Agricultural Money flow 14 ( 1996) 93-102 
 
 H6: maintaining the guess of equal relative 
 price (wasting very little while working or producing something), this guess tests for the total price (wasting very little while working or producing something) of both large and small farms 
 (i.e. as a group); 
 H7: this guess tests for constant returns to 
 scale in all factors of production. 
 We tested the (connected/related) guesses under the two 
 different (detailed description of exactly what is required) of the farm size dividing line. 
 Hl-H5 were tested from the (having no limits, rules, or barriers) model, 
 
 97 
 
 while H6 was tested with two limit/guideline restrictions. 
 For H7, four restrictions were forced on people on the limits/guidelines. The test results are shown in Table 2. The 
 results for the model version for the case of the 5 ha 
 dividing line are discussed first. Hl cannot be rejected. 
 This points to/shows that small and large farms have equal 
 relative money-based (wasting very little while working or producing something). H2 is rejected, suggesting that differences exist in the relative price (wasting very little while working or producing something) between small and large farms. H3 is re-

 jected, which is not surprising given the result of H2. 
 H4 cannot be rejected for large farms, suggesting 
 that large farms have total price (wasting very little while working or producing something). H5 is 
 rejected for small farms. H6 is rejected, again not 
 surprising given that H2 has been rejected. H7 is 
 rejected. 13 &#126; + 13; &amp;lt; I hints that technology on 
 the farms shows decreasing returns to scale. Next 
 we discuss the results of the tests for the case where 
 the farm size dividing line was I 0 ha. As for the 5 ha 
 picture/situation above, HI cannot be rejected, strongly supporting the above end/end result that small and large 
 farms have equal relative money-based (wasting very little while working or producing something). H2 
 cannot be rejected, suggesting that small and large 
 farms have equal relative price (wasting very little while working or producing something). H3 cannot 
 be rejected, pointing to/showing that small and large farms 
 have equal relative technical and price (wasting very little while working or producing something). H4 
 cannot be rejected, but H5 is rejected, results which 
 together appear to point to/show that large farms have 
 total price (wasting very little while working or producing something). H6 was rejected, pointing to/showing 
 that as a group, there exists total price inefficiency among all rice farms in the sample. H7 is 
 rejected, supporting the end of/final opinion of decreasing 
 returns to scale for the technology use on all the rice 
 farms. When all the results are taken together, there 
 is certainly (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) that when account is taken of 
 differences in access to extension, use of modem 
 varieties, credit and education, there are no differ- 
 
 ences in relative money-based (wasting very little while working or producing something) between small 
 and large rice farms in Cote d'lvoire. 
 
 3.2. Ability to stretch guesses and effects/results/suggestions 
 An issue of central interest to policy makers is the 
 (quality of quickly responding to things) of output supply and factor demands 
 to price policy, and how they are affected by investment and land policies (Lau and Yotopoulos, I979). 
 Such guesses are missing for rice in Cote d'Ivoire. 
 An advantage of the profit function approach is that 
 it permits plain/honest/easy derivation of own-price 
 and cross-price output supply and input demand 
 elasticities. Indirect guesses of production elasticities were came/coming from identities which link the 
 coefficients of the profit function and those of the 
 production function. It has been noted that these 
 indirect input elasticities, when compared with those 
 received/got from the production function, have the clear/separate advantage of (related to studying numbers) (state of always working or appearing the same way) (Sidhu, 
 197 4). These guesses of indirect elasticities are 
 compared with direct ability to stretch guesses received/got 
 from an guessed production function. All elasticities have the expected signs. The ability to stretch of rice 
 output is highest for labor (0.408) followed by (material that makes plants grow better) (0.267), land (0.204) and capital (0.036). 
 To examine the output and factor demand respon-

 fications of farm size (i.e. under 5 ha and 10 ha), 
 using the (having no limits, rules, or barriers) limit/guideline guesses. These 
 elasticities, given in Tables 3-5, are compared with 
 guesses received/got by previous studies on rice farms 
 in Asia. The ability to stretch guesses from the two alternate model (detailed descriptions of exactly what is required) are very almost the same, supporting the strength of the (described the future) guesses. The 
 rice supply response to changes in paddy price is 
 (a) little inelastic (Table 3). The output supply elasticities with respect to land (0.69) and capital (0.15) 
 point to/show the output response of an average farm to 
 increases in land and capital, holding wage rate (not 
 amount of labor) and (material that makes plants grow better) price (not amount of 
 (material that makes plants grow better)) constant. Increasing the amounts of land 
 and capital will shift the not important working well curves 
 of labor and (material that makes plants grow better) upwards. The hint/result/effect is 
 that, holding wage rate and (material that makes plants grow better) price constant, a 
 1% increase in amount of rice land will result in a 
 0.7% increase in rice output and a 1% increase in 
 capital will result in a 0.2% increase in rice output. 
 The inelastic own-price paddy supply ability to stretch, and 
 the inelastic paddy supply ability to stretch with respect to 
 the fixed factors, may be due to the lack of improved 
 rice technologies which limits increases in land working well. The highly elastic demand for (material that makes plants grow better)

 (Table 4) with respect to paddy price (1.97-2.03) 
 points to/shows that increases in paddy prices would lead to 
 big increase in farmers' demand for (material that makes plants grow better)s 
 to strengthen rice production. However, the highly 
 elastic own-price ability to stretch of (material that makes plants grow better) demand 
 (- 1.43 to - 1.53) hints that increases in (material that makes plants grow better) prices would lead to big reduction in 
 (material that makes plants grow better) usage. The guessed highly elastic labor 
 demand ability to stretch (1.97-2.03) with respect to paddy 
 price (Table 5) points to/shows that increases in paddy 
 prices will lead to a big increase in labor 
 (mental concentration/picking up of a liquid) in the highly labor-intensive rice farms. 
 (in almost the same way), the highly elastic own-price labor demand 
 ability to stretch (- 1.6) points to/shows that (coming from the outside of something)ly enforced 
 government helping action in the (away from cities) labor market to 
 raise (lower) (away from cities) wage rates for farming-based labor 
 above (below) the market decided/figured out rates would 
 have major effects on the labor intensive rice production systems by creating major decline (increase) in 
 labor (mental concentration/picking up of a liquid) in rice production. 
 
 4. Ends/end results 
 In this paper we examined the relative money-based 
 (wasting very little while working or producing something) of small and large rice farms in Cote 
 
 d'Ivoire using a profit function approach. We found 
 no difference in the money-based (wasting very little while working or producing something) of small 
 and large farms. This end/end result is strong under 
 different model (detailed descriptions of exactly what is required). Some land-related policy effects/results/suggestions for the rice part/area of Cote 
 d'Ivoire can be drawn from the findings. The most 
 (enough to be meaningful) is that land-related changes directed towards 
 further concentration of landholding for large farms 
 cannot be reasonable based on money-based (wasting very little while working or producing something). 
 Such programs can only be reasonable from the point of view of politics-based things to think about that often favor 
 the snob/snobby social class that control much of the large 
 scale farms in Cote d'Ivoire (Widner, 1993). At 
 times, the government has taken steps to mechanize 
 rice production through direct land taking and 
 re-distribution to form large scale farms. However, 
 money-based studies of large-scale fully mechanized 
 rice projects in northern Cote d'lvoire (i.e. Grand 
 Travaux, Projet Soja) show very high money-based 
 losses (Berger et al., 1990). The preference for a 
 large-farm led approach to rice production is a bias 
 not supported by any (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) of superior money-based 
 (wasting very little while working or producing something) of large farms. 
 Secondly, results show that within the (related to the existence of two things) 
 farm size land-related structure in Cote d'Ivoire, there 
 exists (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) of total allocative inefficiency. 
 Policy helping actions are needed to remove such management related inefficiencies in rice production either through the development of a better market 
 price information system or effective farmer-oriented 
 technical training programs by rice extension workers. 
 Finally, results point to/show that access to credit and 
 use of modem rice varieties increase (a lot) 
 (money made/good things received). A few improved rice varieties are available 
 in Cote d'lvoire, but many farms do not have access 
 to them because of poor seed distribution service, 
 and ineffectiveness of the extension service. To improve technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) of rice farms, a more 
 fast program to provide information, credit, 
 improved seeds and other inputs is needed. The 
 recent establishment of a combined (away from cities) development (service business/government unit/power/functioning) (ONADER: Organization Nationale 
 d' Appui au_pair Developpement (away from cities) e) will be useful in providing farmers access to these inputs. 
 Our results strongly suggest that government policies 
 on such farm support services should not be (created unfair thinking in)/(unfair-thinking) 
 against smallholder rice farms.
