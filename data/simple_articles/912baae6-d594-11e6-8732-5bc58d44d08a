 Abstract 
 Why do men and women put into use farming-based technologies at different rates? (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) from Ghana hints that (male/female status)-linked 
 differences in the adoption of modern maize varieties and chemical (material that makes plants grow better) result from (male/female status)-linked differences in access 
 to (completing/matching) inputs. This finding has important policy effects/results/suggestions, because it hints that securing/making sure of more (existing all over a large area) 
 and fair adoption of improved technologies may not require changes in the research system, but rather introduction 
 of measures that secure/make sure of better access for women to (completing/matching) inputs, especially land, labor, and extension services.

 1. Introduction 
 Over the last few years, development practitiOners have 
 become more and more interested in questions relating to 
 the distributional hits/effects of technical change in farming. Scientific breakthroughs such as the muchpublicized green revolutions in wheat and rice have 
 brought about dramatic working well gains in many 
 important cereal crops, but the constant state of long-lasting 
 (bad food quality) among a big part of the world's

 population has led to the (understanding/achieving a goal) that millions of 
 people still lack reliable access to (good) enough amounts of food. Many of these people are smallholder 
 farmers in developing countries. 
 This (understanding/achieving a goal) has focused increased attention on 
 issues relating to the development and spreading around 
 of improved farming-based technologies. If certain groups of farmers are not putting into use improved technologies 
 or are putting into use them at a lower rate than other groups, 
 then we need to decide/figure out why, because only by 
 understanding the reasons will we be able to develop 
 improved technologies that are appropriate for all. 
 More clearly, since women farmers tend to put into use 
 improved technologies at a lower rate than male farmers, we need to understand the reasons behind what

 appear to be (male/female status)-linked differences in technology 
 adoption rates. 
 
 tary inputs that affect adoption indirectly, then it may 
 be more important to work on improving women's 
 access to these (completing/matching) inputs. 
 
 1.1. Research goals 
 Using scientific data from Ghana, we face/deal with three 
 questions about (male/female status) and technology adoption. First, 
 does including (male/female status) as an explanatory (number or thing that changes) in 
 standard moving backward models add to our understanding of the technology adoption process? Second, can 
 farmers' adoption decisions be better understood by 
 clearly (thinking about/when one thinks about) household (related to what holds something together and makes it strong) (numbers that change/things that change), 
 especially the (male/female status) of the household head? Third, 
 to what extent are often watched/followed differences in 
 the rates at which men and women adopt improved 
 technology (named after/discovered by/caused by) (male/female status)-linked differences in 
 access to (completing/matching) inputs, such as land, labor, 
 and extension services? 
 These questions are of obvious practical importance, because they go directly to the issue of whether 
 (male/female status)-related differences in adoption patterns happen 
 because (a) men and women have different preferences when it comes to technology, or (b) men and 
 women have the same preferences when it comes 
 to technology but face different restrictions that prevent them from adopting at the same rate. Men's and 
 women's technology preferences can differ for many 
 reasons. For example, crop varietal preferences can 
 differ by (male/female status) if men and women have different 
 uses for a particular crop. In cases where women 
 grow a crop mostly for home consumption and 
 men grow the same crop mostly for sale, women 
 and men may have different preferences for varietal 
 (features/ qualities/ traits) such as appearance, taste, ease of processing, ease of cooking, and storage. Also, if women 
 farmers are naturally more risk disliking than men or 
 less new and interesting, then this might explain lower levels of 
 adoption. 
 Identifying the causes of (male/female status)-related differences 
 in adoption is important, because if (male/female status) affects the 
 adoption process directly - in other words, if men 
 and women adopt at different rates even when they 
 face exactly the same restrictions - then it may be 
 necessary to change research plans to make sure that 
 technologies are developed that meet their different needs. If, on the other hand, differential rates of 
 adoption arise because men and women face different 
 restrictions, especially unequal access to complemen- 
 
 2. Maize in Ghana 
 Maize in Ghana makes a especially appropriate 
 case study for this question (or investigation) into the links between (male/female status) and adoption for at least three reasons. 
 First, maize is Ghana's most important cereal 
 crop. It is grown by almost all (away from cities) families in all parts of the country except for the Sudan 
 Savannah zone of the far north. According to official 
 statistics, the area planted to maize in Ghana now 
 averages about 650,000 ha per year. Most maize is 
 (helped to grow) in association with other crops, so planting 
 densities for maize are usually low. Grain yields of 
 maize per unit land area are equally modest, 
 averaging less that 2 t!ha. Total once-a-year maize production is now guessed at just over 1 million t. 
 Second, maize is the most widely ate/destroyed staple 
 in Ghana. A national survey carried out in 1990 showed/told about that over 94% of all families had ate/destroyed 
 maize during an randomly selected 2-week period 
 (Politician and Higgins, 1992). Another study based 
 on 1987 data found that maize and maize-based food 
 accounted for 10.8% of total food expenses by 
 poor families and 10.3% of food expenses by 
 all families (Boateng et al., 1990). 
 Third, both men and women help grow maize in 
 Ghana. Furthermore- and in this respect Ghana is different from many other countries- women often 
 manage their own maize fields, add/give an important proportion of overall labor needed things, and 
 exercise complete wisdom when making decisions over the disposal of the 
 harvest. Because maize production activities are managed (in a self-ruling way) by men and women, technology 
 choice decisions tend to be made independently by 
 men and women, which makes it easier to distinguish 
 (male/female status)-related dimensions of the adoption process. 
 
 2.1. Ghana's maize-based farming systems 
 Generally speaking, the climate in Ghana grows 
 hotter and drier as one moves northward and inland 
 away from the Atlantic coast. Maize cropping systems 
 and production technologies change/differ  between the four 
 
 C.R. Doss, M.L. Morris I Farming-based Money flow 25 (2001) 27-39 
 
 agro-(related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) zones in which big amounts of 
 maize are (helped to grow). 
 The Coastal Savannah zone includes a narrow 
 belt of Savannah that runs along the Atlantic coast, 
 widening towards the east of the country. Farmers in 
 this zone grow maize and cassava as their principal 
 staples, often intercropped. Once-a-year rainfall, which is 
 bimodally distributed, totals only 800 mm per year, 
 so most maize is planted following the beginning of the 
 major rains beginning in March or April. Soils are 
 generally light in texture and low in life-creating ability, and 
 working well is low. 
 Immediately inland from the Coastal Savannah 
 lies the forest zone. Most of Ghana's forest is 
 semi-(dropping leaves every autumn), with a small area of high rain forest 
 remaining only in the southwestern part of the country near the border with Cote d'Ivoire. Maize in the 
 forest zone is grown in scattered plots, usually intercropped with cassava, plantain, or cocoyam as part 
 of a bush unplanted system. Some maize is ate/destroyed 
 in the forest zone, but it is not a leading food staple, 
 and much of the crop is sold. Once-a-year rainfall averages about 1500 mm, and maize is planted both in the 
 major rainy season (beginning in March) and in the 
 minor rainy season (beginning in September). 
 Moving further north, the forest zone slowly 
 gives way to the change zone. The exact edge is 
 subject to argue, which is not surprising (thinking about/when one thinks about) 
 that the edge-related area is seen as a constantly 
 changing (large cloth made by sewing together lots of odd pieces of cloth) of Savannah and forest plots. 
 What is certain, however, is that the change zone is 
 an important area for commercial grain production. 
 Much of the change zone has deep, crumbly soils, 
 and the (compared to other things) thinly distributed tree cover allows for more 
 continuous (producing crops/helping something grow) and greater use of mechanized 
 equipment. Rainfall is bimodally distributed and averages about 1300 mm per year. Maize in the change 
 zone is planted in both the major and minor seasons, 
 usually as a monocrop or in association with yam or 
 cassava. 
 The Guinea Savannah zone occupies most of the 
 northern part of the country. Once-a-year rainfall totals 
 about 1100 mm and falls in a single rainy season 
 beginning in April or May. (grass grown for food) and millet are 
 the most in control/most common cereals in the Guinea Savannah, but 
 maize grown in association with small grains, groundnut and/or cowpeas is also important. Some fields 
 are prepared by tractor, but most are prepared by 
 
 29 
 
 hand. Maize is grown in permanently (helped to grow) fields 
 located close to homes, as well as in more distant 
 plots under shifting (producing crops/helping something grow). 
 2.2. Improved maize production technologies 
 
 Our analysis focuses on factors affecting the adoption of two improved maize production technologies: 
 modem varieties (MVs) 2 and chemical (material that makes plants grow better). 
 These technologies were developed and taught through the Ghana Grains Development Project 
 (GGDP), an 18-year research and extension project 
 that was established to develop and spread around improved technologies for maize and grain (peas, beans, lentils, etc.). 
 2.3. Modern varieties (MVs) 
 
 Before beginning of the GGDP, plant people (who help animals have babies) 
 working at Ghana's national maize breeding institute, 
 the Crops Research Institute (CRI), had developed 
 and released a few MV s of maize. These early MV s 
 created little interest among farmers, however, and 
 they were not widely adopted. Under the GGDP, the 
 CRI maize breeding program was reorganized, with 
 the goal of strengthening links with international 
 research centers. At the same time, an long/big 
 on-farm testing program was introduced to increase 
 the role of farmers in the varietal test process. 
 These changes led eventually to the release of a series 
 of maize MV s seen as high producing/giving up ability, 
 increased resistance to sicknesses and insect pests, improved drought tolerance, and improved grain quality. 
 The seed of these MVs was produced and distributed 
 to farmers through some big plans/layouts/dishonest plans involving 
 CRI, the extension service, NGOs, and private seed 
 companies. 
 2.4. Chemical (material that makes plants grow better) 
 
 At the time the GGDP was launched, few farmers 
 in Ghana were applying chemical (material that makes plants grow better) to their 
 maize fields. The low level of (material that makes plants grow better) use on maize 
 was quickly identified as a priority problem for rese2 As used here, the term modem varieties (MVs) refers to improved open-(bringing pollen from one plant to another) varieties (OPVs) and combinations developed by a 
 formal plant breeding program. Local varieties refers to farmers' 
 traditional varieties.

 arch, because experimental (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) showed clearly 
 that soil life-creating ability was very much holding back yields 
 in many areas. Although the relative unpopularity 
 of (material that makes plants grow better) among Ghanaian maize farmers could 
 be attributed to some causes, one significant 
 problem was that there were no combined, widely 
 (easy to get to, use, or understand) recommendations for applying (material that makes plants grow better) to 
 maize. In an attempt to fix this problem, GGDP 
 (people who work to find information) organized an on-farm testing program 
 aimed at developing (material that makes plants grow better) recommendations for 
 maize. The challenge was to plan recommendations that would be (good or well enough) flexible to change something (to help someone)/take care of someone the wide range of soil life-creating ability conditions found 
 in farmers' fields, yet at the same time simple enough 
 to be included into existing extension programs. 
 Following a few years of trials, GGDP (people who work to find information) 
 came up with a set of (material that makes plants grow better) recommendations that 
 distinguished among agro-(related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) zones and took 
 into account field cropping histories. The recommendations were (helped increase/showed in a good way) through a national extension 
 (series of actions to reach a goal) that included thousands of on-farm (acts of showing or proving) and farmer field days. 
 It is important to note that the two technologies 
 differ in some ways that can be expected 
 to influence the adoption process. MVs are a (compared to other things) simple technology, in the sense that farmers 
 who decide to adopt MVs must make few 
 changes to their current practices. MVs are also cheap: the cost of MV seed contains a 
 small proportion of total production costs. Mostly 
 for these reasons, MV s should be (easy to get to, use, or understand) to all 
 farmers, (without any concern about/having nothing to do with) their useful thing/valuable supply gift or 
 technical management skills. 
 In contrast, chemical (material that makes plants grow better) is a (compared to other things) 
 complex technology, in the sense that farmers who 
 decide to adopt (material that makes plants grow better) must learn the names of 
 different products, their nutrient (combination of different substances, objects, people, etc.), correct 
 application rates (based on field (features/ qualities/ traits)), best use schedules, and (producing a lot with very little waste) application 
 methods. Also, chemical (material that makes plants grow better) is expensive: 
 the cost of buying-related chemical (material that makes plants grow better), moving 
 it to the farm, and applying it increases (a lot) 
 cash outlays. For these reasons, it is reasonable to 
 expect that (material that makes plants grow better) is likely to be adopted more 
 easily by richer farmers (who can more easily 
 afford the cost) and/or better educated farmers who 
 possess greater technical knowledge and superior 
 management skills. 
 
 In (thinking about/when one thinks about) the adoption decision, it is important 
 to keep in mind that there is an interaction between 
 MV s and (material that makes plants grow better), so that the benefits of putting into use both 
 technologies go beyond the sum of the benefits (accomplished or gained) 
 by adopting only one or the other. 
 
 3. Data 
 Data on the adoption of MVs and chemical (material that makes plants grow better) were collected through a national survey of maize 
 growers carried out between November 1997 and 
 March 1998. A three-stage, grouped, randomized 
 procedure was used to select a representative sample 
 of 420 maize farmers located in 60 villages throughout the country. These farmers were questioned at 
 length about their maize production, consumption, 
 and marketing practices; their preferences for different maize varietal (features/ qualities/ traits); and their knowledge 
 of and access to improved inputs, such as seed and 
 (material that makes plants grow better) (for added/more details about the survey, see 
 Morris et al. (1999)). 
 An impacts study carried out following the end/ending/firing of the GGDP showed/told about that both MVs and (material that makes plants grow better) have been adopted less a lot by women 
 than by men. During the 1997 cropping season, 39.0% 
 of female farmers planted MVs compared to 59.0% 
 of male farmers, and 16.2% of female farmers applied 
 (material that makes plants grow better) to their maize fields compared to 22.5% 
 of male farmers (Morris et al., 1999). Here, we are 
 interested in identifying the factors that gave rise to 
 these watched/followed differences in adoption rates. 
 Many technology adoption studies tell the difference between the rate of adoption (defined as the proportion 
 of farmers that adopt a given technology, (without any concern about/having nothing to do with) 
 the level of use) and the strength of adoption (defined 
 in terms of the level of use of the technology, e.g. 
 the proportion of the farmer's land planted to MV s or 
 the amount applied of (material that makes plants grow better)). In Ghana, farmers 
 who adopt MV s tend to plant them over their whole 
 (areas of owned land), so the strength measure usually takes 
 on a value of either 0 or 100%. The rate of adoption 
 measure therefore ends up being almost the same as the 
 strength of adoption measure. In the case of (material that makes plants grow better), the available data did not enable us to decide/figure out 
 the amount of (material that makes plants grow better) applied by each farmer. For 
 these reasons, we chose to focus only on rates of 
 adoption.

 4. Adoption model 
 Maize farmers in Ghana must decide whether to 
 adopt MVs, (material that makes plants grow better), or both. The benefits (understood/made real/achieved) 
 when both technologies are put into use both/together go beyond 
 the sum of the benefits (understood/made real/achieved) when each one is 
 adopted separately, so the decision to adopt one technology can be expected to affect the decision to adopt 
 the other. Because the two adoption decisions are 
 linked, we use a two-stage probit approach. In the 
 first stage, the full set of estimators is used to (describe the future) 
 the chance of adopting either (material that makes plants grow better) or MVs. In 
 the second stage, (described the future) values for MV adoption 
 and (material that makes plants grow better) adoption are included as independent 
 (numbers that change/things that change) in the final set of guesses. Consistent 
 standard errors on the (things that you control (like study times), that cause other things to change (like test scores)) are 
 created using a helping procedure. 
 The basic model is specified as follows: 
 MYadopter = fh X 1 + thfertadopter* 
 fertadopter = fhX2 
 
 + c: 1 
 
 + ,84MVadopter* +c:2 
 
 where MVadopter and fertadopter are dummy (numbers that change/things that change) pointing to/showing whether the farmer adopted MV s 
 and/or (material that makes plants grow better), X1 and X2 are vectors of (numbers that change/things that change) expected to affect the technology adoption decision, and 
 MVadopter* and fertadopter* are the (described the future) values 
 (created as described in the previous/coming before paragraph) 
 of the adoption (numbers that change/things that change). All of the independent 
 (numbers that change/things that change) are discussed in detail below. 
 Dummy (numbers that change/things that change) are included for three (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) 
 zones in which maize is (helped to grow): the Coastal Savannah, the change zone, and the Guinea Savannah 
 (a fourth zone, the forest zone, serves as the reference). The purpose of the zonal dummy (numbers that change/things that change) is to 
 control for agro-(related to the Earth's weather) differences that could affect 
 the money-making ability of the technologies. Since the northern part of the country, including almost all of the 
 Guinea Savannah zone and parts of/amounts of the change 
 zone, is lived-in mainly by Muslim (groups of people related by culture, race, religion, etc.) 
 among which women tend to be less responsible for 
 farming, the zonal dummy (numbers that change/things that change) may also pick 
 up some cultural (quality of changing over time or at different places), which could be linked to 
 (male/female status) effects. 
 A few (features/ qualities/ traits) of the farmer are included 
 as covariates. The farmer's (male/female status) is represented by 
 a dummy (number or thing that changes). Instead of using the (male/female status) of 
 the household head (the ordinary practice in most 
 
 31 
 
 adoption studies), we use the (male/female status) of the farmer. 
 This allows us to examine the behavior of female farmers in both female- and male-headed families. The 
 farmer's age is also included, as is the farmer's education, expressed as the number of years of formal 
 education completed. 
 Included also are a few other explanatory (numbers that change/things that change) thought to affect technology adoption decisions 
 (most of these (numbers that change/things that change) are a lot discussed in 
 the adoption books; see Feder et al. (1985) and 
 Feder and Umali (1993)). The amount of land owned 
 by the farmer is included, because even though MVs 
 and (material that makes plants grow better) are both expected to be scale-neutral, 
 richer farmers (i.e. those with more land) are more 
 likely to be able to afford (material that makes plants grow better). Since farming-based 
 extension agents serve as an important source of technical information and improved inputs, the number 
 of extension visits received by the farmer is expected 
 to be positively related to the chance of 
 adoption. Market access may also affect the adoption decision, so an index was created to reflect the 
 level of (set of machines) present in the farmer's village 
 (the index was calculated based on the presence or 
 (not being there; not being present) of a tarred road, a good feeder road, reliable 
 transportation, and a physical market). Since adopting 
 a new technology often hints a need for added/more 
 labor, labor availability is often connected with 
 successful adoption. In Model 1, household size is 
 used as a simple measure of labor availability. The 
 books on (male/female status) and farming in Africa (see Doss, 
 1999) hints that men's labor and women's labor 
 are not (able to take the place of each other), however, so in Model 2, we 
 account for labor availability by including as separate 
 explanatory (numbers that change/things that change) the number of adult men, adult 
 women, and children in the farmer's household. 
 In addition to the many factors that are expected to 
 influence adoption of both MV s and (material that makes plants grow better), certain 
 technology-clearly stated/particular factors are expected to influence 
 the two adoption decisions separately. In the case 
 of MV adoption, varietal choice is expected to be 
 influenced by the farmer's seed purchase practices. Therefore, in the MV adoption equation, we 
 include a seed source (number or thing that changes) that points to/shows whether 
 the seed planted in a given maize field was saved 
 from the farm or externally got (e.g. received/got 
 from another farmer, from an extension agent, or 
 from a shop). In the case of (material that makes plants grow better), the adoption 
 decision is expected to be influenced by soil life-creating ability 
 
 32 
 
 C.R. Doss, M.L. Morris I Farming-based Money flow 25 (2001) 27-39 
 
 (things to carefully think about). Therefore, in the (material that makes plants grow better) adoption 
 equation, we include a soil life-creating ability (number or thing that changes) based on 
 the number of years that the field had been continuously cropped. If the field had been unplanted before 
 the year of the survey, we use the number of years 
 that the field had been unplanted, so the (number or thing that changes) can take 
 on positive or negative values. 
 
 5. Scientific results 
 Scientific results received/got from guessing Models 
 1 and 2 are summarized in Table 1. Three parts of 
 the results are important. 
 First, in both models, the (male/female status) (number or thing that changes) doesn't have significant explanatory power. This result is unexpected, 
 (thinking about/when one thinks about) that men and women farmers are known 
 to have put into use the technologies at different rates. 
 Second, many of the other explanatory (numbers that change/things that change) 
 have the expected signs and are (meaningful numbers). In the MV adoption equation, (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) zone, 
 level of education, amount of land owned, number of 
 extension visits, level of (set of machines), and number 
 of adult males in the household (Model 2 only) are 
 positively connected with the chance of adoption. 
 In the (material that makes plants grow better) adoption equation, (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) zone, 
 farmer's age, amount of land owned (Model 1 only), 
 number of extension visits, level of (set of machines), and 
 the substitute for soil life-creating ability are positively connected 
 with the chance of adoption. 
 Third, a few of the explanatory (numbers that change/things that change) lack 
 (meaningful numbers). With the exception of the 
 coefficient on the number of adult men in the MV 
 adoption equation, none of the coefficients on the 
 different measures of labor availability are (related to numbers) 
 significant. This could point to/show that labor availability 
 does not affect MV and (material that makes plants grow better) adoption decisions, 
 or it could simply mean that the (numbers that change/things that change) we are using 
 (based on the number of people living in the farmer's 
 household) are not good indicators of the ability of 
 Ghanaian farmers to (get ready for action) work hard to work in their 
 maize fields. Somewhat more confusing, neither of 
 the guessed coefficients on the (fitted) endogenous 
 (numbers that change/things that change) shows significant explanatory power, suggesting that MV and (material that makes plants grow better) adoption decisions may 
 be taken independently, rather than both/together. 
 As a further test of the importance of (male/female status) 
 on adoption, a chance-ratio test statistic was 
 
 built to test the guess that the coefficient 
 on female is equal to 0 (Ho: tlfemale = 0). In both 
 models, the null guess cannot be rejected. This 
 hints that controlling for other factors, the adoption of MV s and (material that makes plants grow better) is not connected with the 
 (male/female status) of the farmer. 
 
 6. Female-headed families 
 In Models 1 and 2, the unit of (instance of watching, noticing, or making a statement) is the 
 farmer, so the analysis focuses on the adoption behavior of individual women and men. This is somewhat 
 different from the ordinary approach; in most 
 adoption studies, the unit of (instance of watching, noticing, or making a statement) is the household, and (male/female status) effects are explored by including a 
 dummy (number or thing that changes) pointing to/showing the (male/female status) of the household head. One (bad result or effect) of the ordinary approach 
 is that it does not show/tell about anything about the behavior of 
 female farmers who live in male-headed families. 
 In Ghana, as in other places in Africa, these numbers may 
 be significant. For example, 70% of the female people who responded in our sample were married, suggesting that 
 they may have been living in male-headed families. 
 Failure to tell the difference between the (male/female status) of the 
 farmer and the (male/female status) of the household head may represent an important (something left out), because the restrictions 
 faced by women farmers who live in female-headed 
 families may be worse than those faced by 
 women farmers who live in male-headed families 
 (see Doss (1999) for a review of the books on this 
 issue). 3 A lot of case study (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) hints that 
 female-headed families are less likely to put into use new 
 technologies than male-headed families (for recent 
 examples, see Smale et al. (1991) and Kumar (1994)). 
 Sometimes, we may in fact be interested in understanding the adoption decisions of female-headed 
 families, but here we ask whether the adoption 
 behavior of female farmers differs/changes depending on the 
 (male/female status) of the head of the household in which they live. 
 Household decision-making processes change/differ  throughout Ghana and probably also within our nationally 
 representative sample. Usually, however, women 
 3 To further complicate matters, definitions of female-headed 
 families found in the books are not consistent. For a good 
 discussion of the effects/results/suggestions of the different definitions, see 
 Rogers (1995).

 farmers take independent decisions (related to/looking at/thinking about) the management of farming-based businesses/projects and the disposal 
 of money/money income earned. Although cash, labor, physical inputs (including seed and (material that makes plants grow better)) and information 
 may be swapped/switched within the household, each farmer 
 tends to act independently, and we would not necessarily expect to see (producing a lot with very little waste) flows of useful things/valuable supplies and 
 information (for an example of production losses due 
 to inefficient factor portion within the household, 
 see Udry (1996)). 
 The data set for Ghana unfortunately does not include information about the (male/female status) of the household 
 head. However, from the available data, it is possible 
 to guess  whether the household in which the farmer 
 lives is likely to be male-headed or female-headed. 
 Specifically, it can be assumed that all male farmers 
 and all married female farmers live in male-headed 
 families and that all unmarried female farmers live 
 in female-headed families. 4 Using these ideas (you think are true), 25% of the (female) sample farmers living in 
 female-headed families have adopted MVs, compared to 56% of the (female and male) sample farmers 
 living in male-headed families. (in almost the same way), 13% of 
 the (female) sample farmers living in female-headed 
 families and 22% of the (female and male) sample farmers living in male-headed families have 
 adopted (material that makes plants grow better). 
 In Model 3, we disaggregate the farmers into three 
 categories: (1) male farmers, all of whom completely/in a hinting way 
 live in male-headed families (M/MHH); (2) female 
 farmers living in male-headed families (F/MHH) 
 and (3) female farmers living in female-headed families (F/FHH). Within male-headed families, the 
 MV adoption rate does not differ significantly (in a 
 (related to studying numbers) sense) between male and female farmers 
 (Table 1). However, the MV adoption rate for female 
 farmers living in male-headed families is much higher than the rate for female farmers living 
 in female-headed families. Table 2 presents the 
 not important effects; these are negative and (compared to other things) 
 large for female farmers living in female-headed 
 families. These results point to/show that women do not 
 4 This would count women who report themselves as married but 
 whose husbands are except for as living in male-headed families. 
 Also, if an unmarried woman was living in a household 
 headed by a man that was not her husband (for example, her 
 father, brother, or uncle), she would be wrongly labeled as 
 living in a female-headed household.

 necessarily make different adoption decisions than 
 men, but they also suggest that there is something 
 about the structure of female-headed families that 
 makes farmers living in these families less likely 
 to adopt MVs. In the case of (material that makes plants grow better), the adoption decision is affected neither by the (male/female status) of 
 the farmer nor by the (male/female status) of the household head 
 (Table 1). 
 Chance ratio tests can be used to disaggregate the effects of the (male/female status) of the farmer from the 
 (male/female status) of the household head. First, we test the guess that there is no effect of (male/female status) on adoption 
 by holding back the coefficients on female farmers 
 in both male- and female-headed families to be 0 
 (,BF/MHH = .BF/FHH = 0). This guess is rejected 
 in the case of MV adoption. Then, we hold back the 
 coefficients on the (male/female status) of the household head to

 be the same (tlF/MHH = tlF/FHH = 0), testing the 
 guess that the (male/female status) of the household head is 
 not significant while controlling for the (male/female status) of the 
 farmer. Again, the guess is rejected in the case 
 of MV adoption. Finally, we (do/complete) a second test 
 of the guess that the (male/female status) of the household 
 head does not matter by holding back the coefficient 
 on female farmers in male-headed families to be 0 
 (tlF/MHH = 0). This test is different from the previous one 
 in that it does not control for the (male/female status) of the farmer. 
 For the third time, the guess is rejected. Therefore, we decide that the (male/female status) of the household 
 head does affect MY adoption. 
 When almost the same  chance ratio tests are used to test 
 the same guesses relating to/connected to (material that makes plants grow better) adoption, none of the null guesses can be rejected. 
 This result hints that controlling for other factors, 
 (male/female status) is not an important (thing that decides something) of (material that makes plants grow better) 
 adoption, (without any concern about/having nothing to do with) whether (male/female status) is defined as 
 the (male/female status) of the farmer or (male/female status) of the household 
 head. 
 
 7. Access to key inputs and information 
 The results presented in Table 1 suggest that (male/female status) 
 (by itself/in and of itself)  is not significantly connected with MV or (material that makes plants grow better) adoption rates, although the (male/female status) of the household head may be important. Based on this finding, 
 we ask whether (male/female status) is linked to factors that indirectly influence adoption behavior. Especially, since 
 adoption is related to land ownership, number 
 
 of adult men in the farmer's household (MV adoption 
 only), education, and number of contacts with the 
 extension service, are these factors related to 
 (male/female status)? 
 Descriptive statistics and simple linear (moving backwards) 
 can help to decide/figure out if women and men enjoy 
 equal access to land, labor, education, and extension 
 services. 
 
 7.1. Land 
 Wealth is often positively connected with the adoption of new technologies, because richer farmers 
 are better able to bear risk and therefore are more likely 
 to try new technologies. In (away from cities) Ghana, land ownership provides a good measure of wealth. Clearly, there 
 is some sort of association between land ownership 
 and (male/female status): women tend to own smaller plots than 
 men, and a greater proportion of women are landless 
 (Table 3). (in almost the same way), women tend to help grow smaller 
 plots than do men. 5 Female farmers in female-headed 
 families own and help grow smaller plots than female farmers in male-headed families. The (things that decide other things) of land ownership were explored using a to bit 
 approach. Controlling for the farmer's age, residency 
 status (native or settler), and (whether someone is single, married, divorced, etc.), as well as 
 for (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) zone and level of (set of machines), women 
 farmers on average were found to have significantly 
 less access to land (Table 4). 
 5 The amount of land helped grow by individual farmers reflects 
 not only their access to land but also their access to the labor 
 needed to help grow it.

 7.2. Labor 
 
 many parts of Africa, men have claim over women's 
 labor, but women do not have almost the same  claim over men's 
 labor. Therefore, the data do not allow us to decide that female farmers have access to male labor; 
 they simply point to/show that the families in which female farmers live include men who could possibly 
 provide labor. 
 
 Throughout many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, 
 women have greater difficulty than men in getting 
 labor, especially male labor needed for land preparation activities (e.g. clearing, burning, plowing). Within 
 our sample, women farmers live in families that 
 contain (a) little fewer men on average, except for in 
 the change zone (Table 5). Household size differs/changes 
 by zone, but within zones there do not appear to be 
 a big differences between the household sizes 
 of male and female farmers. The data this way suggest 
 that male and female maize farmers live in families that contain about the same number of 
 adults. Female-headed families have fewer men, 
 but they still contain some adult men. The data do not 
 allow us to decide/figure out who these men are, but they 
 may be adult sons. 
 What these numbers cannot tell us, however, is 
 whether male and female maize farmers have equal 
 access to the labor of other household members. In 
 
 7.3. Education 
 Although education is not an input, education 
 is known to be important in deciding/figuring out farmers' 
 ability to understand and manage unfamiliar technology. The moving backward results point to/show that education is a significant (thing that decides something) of MV adoption in 
 Ghana. Education patterns change/differ  by (male/female status). Female 
 farmers have less years of education, on average, 
 than male farmers (Table 6). Female farmers in 
 female-headed families have less years of education than female farmers in male-headed families 
 (Table 7).

 7.4. Extension contacts 
 The uptake of new technologies is often influenced 
 by the farmer's contact with extension services, since 
 extension agents provide improved inputs and technical guidance. Within our sample, the frequency of contact with extension agents is strongly connected with 
 the (male/female status) of the farmer. On average, women reported 
 fewer contacts with extension agents, and a larger proportion of women reported no extension contacts at 
 all (Table 8). In understanding/explaining the data in Table 8, it is 
 important to keep in mind that differences in the number of reported contacts with extension agents may not 
 be (named after/discovered by/caused by) the (male/female status) of the farmer but instead 
 could result from other factors that are related to 
 the (male/female status) of the farmer. For example, it is reasonable 
 that extension agents might prefer to visit farmers with 
 more land, a larger area planted to maize, or those 
 who have already put into use improved technologies, all 
 of which happen to be related to (male/female status). 
 On the whole, these studies suggest that male and 
 female maize farmers in Ghana do not enjoy equal 
 access to land, education, and farming-based extension 
 services. The data are less definite (related to/looking at/thinking about) the 
 availability of and access to labor, especially male 
 labor within the household.

 In view of this (event(s) or object(s) that prove something), what can we end/decide 
 about the three questions presented/caused at the beginning of the 
 paper? 
 First, in this example involving maize in Ghana, 
 after we control for farmer's age and level of education, access to land and labor, contact with the extension service, and market access, there is no significant 
 association between the (male/female status) of the farmer and the 
 chance of adopting MV s or (material that makes plants grow better). Since men 
 and women have adopted MV s and (material that makes plants grow better) at different rates, this finding shows the extreme importance of 
 correctly specifying adoption models. Failure to control for (male/female status)-linked factors can lead to sneaky and false 
 ends/end results about the importance of (male/female status) (by itself/in and of itself)  as 
 an explanatory factor. 6 
 Second, being a female farmer and living in a 
 female-headed household affect the adoption decision in quite different ways. Therefore, although 
 people living in female-headed families are less 
 likely to put into use new technologies than people living 
 in male-headed families, this does not necessarily 
 mean that female farmers are less likely to put into use new 
 technologies than male farmers. (in a true way), simply 
 identifying the (male/female status) of the household head does 
 not completely take by force/take control of what we are interested in, 
 which is whether women farmers can (get ready for action) the 
 support of male household members in order to gain 
 access to useful things/valuable supplies. However, this information tends 
 to be hard to get through ordinary survey 
 methods, so (male/female status) of the household head is a useful 
 substitute. 7 
 
 6 One warning should be noted. The sample includes only farmers 
 who were identified as 'maize farmers'. If either men or women 
 were surprisingly more left out/kept out from the sample because they 
 were not thought about/believed maize farmers, the results could be (created unfair thinking in)/(unfair-thinking). 
 The proportion of women farmers in the sample goes along with 
 the percentage of women growing maize identified through the 
 1991-1992 round of the Ghana Living Standard Survey (reported 
 in Doss (1997)), however, so we believe these results were not 
 affected by sample selection bias. 
 7 Sometimes, making ideas (you think are true) about control of useful things/valuable supplies 
 based on the (male/female status) of the household head can lead to wrong 
 ends/end results. For example, women farmers often report that 
 their husband is the head of the household, even though he may 
 live in other places and may not be involved in farming-based decisionmaking.

 Third, the watched/followed measures of access to land 
 and number of extension contacts are clearly related to (male/female status). However, it is not possible to 
 decide/figure out from the data whether women have access to the same quality of land as men. Nor can it 
 be decided/figured out whether the amount and/or quality 
 of information given by extension workers differ 
 depending on the (male/female status) of the farmer. If women 
 regularly have access to poor quality land or regularly receive poorer quality extension information, 
 this would bias our results, in the sense that the effect 
 of (male/female status) would be overstated (i.e. the (value of a number, ignoring its sign) 
 of the guessed coefficient on the (male/female status) (number or thing that changes) in 
 an adoption equation would be larger). (in the opposite way), 
 if women regularly farm better quality land or 
 regularly receive better extension information, the 
 effect of (male/female status) would be controlled/not showy. Also, as (before that/before now) noted, although the number of men in the 
 household is related to MV adoption, simply 
 counting the number of household members does not 
 show whether women can (get ready for action) the labor 
 that is present in their families to work in their 
 maize fields. So, even though differences can be 
 watched/followed in access to land, extension visits, and male 
 household labor, unseen differences may also 
 be present, and these unseen differences may be 
 as significant or even more significant in influencing 
 adoption behavior. 
 On the whole, these results from Ghana suggest that 
 technology adoption decisions depend mostly on 
 access to useful things/valuable supplies, rather than on (male/female status) (by itself/in and of itself). This 
 end/end result should be understood/explained with caution, however, because it does not mean that MVs 
 and (material that makes plants grow better) are (male/female status)-neutral technologies. If adoption of MVs and/or (material that makes plants grow better) depend on access to land, 
 labor, or other useful things/valuable supplies, and if, in a particular big picture, 
 men tend to have better access to these useful things/valuable supplies than 
 women, then in that big picture, the technologies will not 
 benefit men and women equally. Policy changes this way 
 may be needed to increase women's access to the key 
 useful things/valuable supplies; (using other choices), it may be desirable to change 
 research efforts by (in a carefully-planned way) targeting technologies 
 that are especially suited for the useful things/valuable supplies that are 
 available to women. The bottom line is that it is important to examine both the technology itself and the 
 physical and institutional big picture  in which the technology is used in order to (describe the future) whether it will 
 be adopted successfully by women as well as men.

 Responses 
 
 We would like to express our emotional thankfulness to some of the many people who helped make 
 this article possible. A.A. Dampyi and Robert Tripp 
 were useful in designing and putting into use 
 the national technology adoption study. Staff of the 
 Crops Research Institute in Kumasi gave/given valuable help in carrying out the field survey. Barry 
 Goodwin and William Greene generously shared 
 their knowledge of helping ways of doing things. Two 
 unnamed reviewers added/gave some useful 
 comments.
