 Abstract 
 This study examines the need for crop insurance for litchi production in northern Vietnam and how farmers might participate 
 in such a program. Possible insurance programs were developed which proposed all-risk coverage based on area yields. 
 This coverage was offered to farmers to decide/figure out both their interest in the program and how insurance features and farmer 
 (features/ qualities/ traits) affected their decision to buy insurance. Farmers were also surveyed (related to/looking at/thinking about) their production practices, 
 price and yield expectations, and (money-related) and personal (features/ qualities/ traits). Even before (thinking about/when one thinks about) other program costs and 
 government budget restrictions, there is not a strong case for beginning and building on a crop insurance program here. Results point to/show 
 that while farmer participation would be significant, crop insurance is not needed to (accomplish or gain with effort) policy goals like raising farmer 
 income or (promising that something will definitely happen or that something will definitely work as described) survival/income levels of income. Crop insurance is not needed to (help increase/show in a good way) litchi production, which is 
 already expanding quickly due to its high a money-making state relative to other farm businesses/projects. In their choice of coverages, farmers 
 preferred higher yield (promise that something will definitely happen or that something will definitely work as described) levels and lower indemnity prices. Guessed premiums were quite low when expressed as 
 a percent of expected money/money income, and farmers were not (able to reply or react/quick to respond) to changes in premiums. Econometric analysis pointed to/showed 
 that high income farmers were more likely to participate, but other farmer (features/ qualities/ traits) seemed to matter little. (probably true) 
 (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) suggested that farmers believed the expected area yields used to set insurance coverage levels were too low. Because 
 litchi working well differs/changes significantly by tree age and the litchi planted area is expanding quickly, deciding/figuring out appropriate 
 values for expected area produces and insurance coverage levels appeared to be the biggest challenge in program design. It is 
 guessed that added/more farmer education about the relationship between area and farm produces and other parts of area 
 insurance could improve such a program's operation. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

 1. Introduction 
 Crop insurance has been used in a variety of 
 forms and for a variety of purposes in more than 70 
 countries, according to an FAO survey published in 
 199l(FAO, 1991). Especially, developing countries 
 have established crop insurance programs not only to 
 provide farmers with another risk management tool

 but also to (help increase/show in a good way) other goals, such as improving 
 farmers' access to credit, (helping increase/showing in a good way) production of 
 high-value crops that might also have higher yield 
 risk, and providing more (firm and steady nature/lasting nature/strength) to agriculture and 
 related businesses. There have been quite changing/different degrees of success over the years, across countries and 
 across a few types of insurance programs (see Hazell 
 et al., 1986; Hueth and Furtan, 1994; Mishra, 1996). 
 At this date, Vietnam has no formal farming-based insurance programs. As part of a (teacher and teaching-related) program 
 related to risk analysis in farming-based production with

 the Teachers/professors of Money flow and (away from cities) Development at 
 Hanoi Farming-based University #1, a study was done/tried to test farmers' interest in crop insurance 
 for a crop in northern Vietnam. A few questions were 
 important at the beginning: could crop insurance be used 
 to (help increase/show in a good way) production of high-value, (not appearing or happening in the usual way) 
 crops; what types of insurance coverage would be 
 appropriate for the particular conditions of northern 
 Vietnam; would farmers' incomes be significantly (made steady/made firm and strong) by crop insurance; would farmers (without being forced) 
 participate in the program; and what factors appeared 
 to affect farmers' insurance decisions. 
 Litchi (Litchi chinensis) was carefully thought about/believed the right/the proper crop for study because it appeared to be highly 
 money-making, yet it could be thought about/believed a (not appearing or happening in the usual way) 
 crop that has not been widely adopted. Also, the 
 view commonly held among farmers was that litchi 
 production was rather uncertain. The first (or most important) litchi 
 growing area in northern Vietnam is near Hanoi, and 
 local (people in charge) in one district there were willing to cooperate with surveys of litchi producers. 
 Two surveys were managed and did/done to collect information facing the issues talked about/said above. A survey 
 in May 1998 looked at farmers' production practices, costs, and expectations for prices and yields 
 for all crop and animals businesses/projects, along with 
 farmers' personal (features/ qualities/ traits) such as age, education, and family size, and (money-related) (features/ qualities/ traits) 
 such as non-farm income and credit availability. A 
 second survey in September 1998 tested farmers' 
 responses to possible crop insurance contracts on 
 litchi production. 
 The following sections describe general conditions 
 for litchi production and other farming practices in the 
 surveyed area, the design of a possible insurance 
 program for litchi, farmer responses to this proposed 
 coverage, and an econometric model of insurance demand. The final section summarizes the need for crop 
 insurance for litchi production in northern Vietnam 
 and some (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) about insurance program design. 
 
 2. Litchi production in northern Vietnam 
 Litchi production in northern Vietnam happens mostly in the huge area bordering the northern edge of the Red River delta. Luc Ngan district in 
 
 Bac Giang area of control/area of land, located about 80 km northeast of 
 Hanoi, was selected for the study, since it is an important center for litchi production in this area. 
 Luc Ngan district has about 1012km2 and is home 
 to 173,000 people living in 31,100 families. Luc 
 Ngan district's labor force works mostly in farming. (related to a group of people with the same race, culture, religion, etc.) Vietnamese contain about 54% of the 
 local population, while 10 other (groups of people related by culture, race, religion, etc.) living 
 in the more area of mountainss of the district contain 
 the rest. Litchi production happens mainly among the 
 Vietnamese (group of people related by culture, race, religion, etc.). 
 The climate and mountains, land, rivers, etc. of Luc Ngan district 
 are well-suited for production of a tree crop like litchi. 
 Once-a-year rainfall is about 1800--2000mm per year, average once-a-year temperature is 18-23Â°C, and Luc Ngan 
 is almost never affected by extreme storms. Only about 18% 
 of the district's land is carefully thought about/believed good for rice and 
 other field crops, while the area good for (helping to grow) 
 fruit trees, consisting of rolling hills, is quite large. 
 Litchi saplings are established by cutting and planting small branches from existing trees. The young 
 trees begin to bear fruit in their third or fourth year, 
 and they continue growing in size and working well 
 until maybe the age of 15 years. They can remain 
 productive forever, with one tree in the area reportedly being more than 200 years old. The trees 
 blossom in early spring (February and March), and 
 the fruit is collected over 1 month's period in late 
 spring (May-June). However, a tree may not bear fruit 
 every year; reportedly only about 60% of trees bear 
 fruit in a given year. This may reflect weather conditions during the flowering period or other weather and 
 disease-related conditions. A serious disease problem 
 appeared in 1997 and 1998, (based on what's seen or what seems obvious) caused by a 
 fungus that affects trees in heavy or poorly drained 
 soils and which kills infected trees in a (compared to other things) short 
 time. New management practices such as reducing 
 planting depth, improving soil drainage, and greater 
 tree trimming are being promoted to  reduce this risk, and 
 a chemical treatment has also been developed which 
 saves about 60% of affected trees if they can be treated 
 at an early stage of the disease. 
 Litchi was introduced into the area in the 1960s 
 by farm families moving from nearby Hai Duong 
 area of control/area of land. Litchi production in Luc Ngan district has 
 developed mostly since 1987, about the beginning 
 of the doi moi money-based renovation period in Vietnam.

 yields from 1991 to 1998 for Luc Ngan district. The 
 most significant (popular thing/general way things are going) in this data seems to be the fast 
 growth in the planted area, growing from 1500 ha in 
 1991 to more than 7000ha in 1998. Of these 7000ha, 
 about 4000 have trees old enough to produce fruit. 
 Local (people in charge) hope to see this (act of something getting bigger, wider, etc.) continue, 
 with a goal of 10,000 ha planted by the year 2005. 
 Table 2 shows almost the same  data for Tru Huu home, the 
 particular home in Luc Ngan district visited for 
 this study. 
 A survey in May 1998 collected information from 
 Tru Huu farmers (related to/looking at/thinking about) their production practices 
 for both crop and animals businesses/projects, their income 
 and credit situations, and other personal (features/ qualities/ traits). One hundred families were interviewed. 
 A few (connected/related) results are reported here.

 Average values for lowest value, highest value, and most 
 likely litchi yields were 4.1, 8.8, and 6.5 t/ha, (match up each pair of items in order). This is much higher than the district average yield, 1.49 t/ha, or the home average yield, 
 2.29 t/ha, over the 1991-1998 period. Further (act of asking questions and trying to find the truth about something) showed/told about that Tru Huu home had more early 
 adopters of litchi production than in other places in the district, and the greater maturity of their trees accounts 
 for at least some of the differences in yields. 
 Further litchi produce information was collected using a "visual impact method," where farmers placed 
 counters into different yield ranges to test their chances (see Hardaker et al., 1997). From this information, a produce dist:J.ibution was received/made from for each 
 farmer. The average produce across all 100 farms from 
 these calculations was 6.22 t/ha, with a standard moving away of 1.44 t, or a coefficient of difference/different version of about 
 26%. This suggests somewhat more (quality of changing over time or at different places) than 
 the minimum and modal yields reported above, where 
 the minimum yield was 63% of the modal yield. Litchi 
 yields on individual farms also seem more (number or thing that changes) 
 than the group yields for the district and home 
 seen in Tables 1 and 2. The lowest district yield from 
 1991 to 1998 was 1.25 t/ha, about 84% of the average, 
 while the lowest home yield over this period was 
 2.10 t/ha, about 91% of average. 
 Farmers reported that the litchi price differs/changes significantly by season, with a low of about 11,000 dong/kg 
 at harvest and an off-season high of as much as 22,000 
 dong/kg (at that time, the exchange rate was about 
 13,000-14,000VN dong= US$1). Storage and processing is a problem, so most output is marketed as 
 fresh fruit shortly after harvest. Farmers reported that 
 they expected to get an average price of about 13,000 
 dong/kg. 
 Litchi production appeared to be quite money-making. 
 With an average yield of about 235 kg/sao (in northern 
 Vietnam, one sao equals 360m2 ) and a market price 
 of 13,000 dong/kg, average money/money income per sao is about 
 3.055 million dong. Farmers reported (number or thing that changes) costs 
 of only about 150,000 dong per sao for litchi, leaving a big amount for land taxes, other overhead 
 costs, and living expenses. A litchi sapling costs only 
 about 10,000 dong, so more trees can be planted at 
 (compared to other things) little expense. A comparison with rice production shows that litchi was nearly five times more 
 money-making. As a result, farmers in Tru Huu only planted 
 rice for home consumption, not for commercial sales. 
 
 176 
 
 M.L. Vandeveer/ Farming-based Money flow 26 (2001) 173-184 
 
 Nearly all families also had some kind of 
 small-scale animals activity. The most common of 
 these was raising market hogs, with 85 families 
 working at this activity. The average once-a-year production was about 240 kg per year (roughly two murder 
 hogs), with the great majority of production being 
 sold commercially. Just over half the families 
 raised chickens, mainly for household consumption, 
 while just over one quarter of the families had plant seed/cause 
 farrowing operations. Animals were fed mostly crop 
 residues and (things produced along with something else) and table scraps, so there 
 was very little cash expense in these operations. 
 (related to/looking at/thinking about) credit, 68 families said they had received loans the previous year from a special government program to (help increase/show in a good way) fruit production. The typical 
 loan in this program was for an amount of 1 million 
 dong, at 0.7% interest per month, with a repayment 
 period of 5 years. Only six other families reported 
 borrowing money from other sources for farming-based 
 purposes. Only three families reported borrowing 
 money for non-farming-based purposes. 
 Only 18 families reported any non-farm income, 
 and only a few of these received big amounts 
 of such. Non-farm income does not play a role in 
 most families' (money-related) plans. The average farm size 
 among families in the sample was about 11 sao 
 (about 0.4 ha), which is larger than average in northem Vietnam. The typical farm household included 
 five people, and farmers had attended school for an 
 average of 7 years. 
 Total once-a-year household income averaged 26.6 million dong, or about 6.2 million dong per person in 
 the household (roughly US$_$ 1973 and US$_$ 427, (match up each pair of items in order)). These amounts are (in an obvious way) higher than 
 average for farm families in northern Vietnam. 
 They seem best explained by the higher a money-making state of litchi production (compared to rice) and the 
 (compared to other things) larger farm size. Average once-a-year farm income per household was 24.6 million dong, and the 
 average for minimum once-a-year farm income was 19.4 
 million dong (about 79% of average once-a-year farm income). The major source of income was litchi production. 
 These results answer some of the questions presented/caused 
 above. First, it appears that crop insurance is probably not necessary to (help increase/show in a good way) the adoption of litchi 
 production. The (compared to other things) high a money-making state of litchi 
 production probably explains the quickly expanding 
 
 litchi plantings, and these will likely continue (without any concern about/having nothing to do with) whether crop insurance is introduced. 
 Second, farm incomes do not appear very variable. While litchi yields showed some (quality of changing over time or at different places), it 
 appears that farmers can expect at least two-thirds of 
 their average incomes in even the worst of years. Farm 
 incomes in the sample, while certainly low, were still 
 above average for farmers in northern Vietnam, and 
 farmers reported that they didn't expect to experience 
 income levels less than about 75% of this average. 
 Crop insurance for litchi could provide more (firm and steady nature/lasting nature/strength) 
 to farmers' incomes, but it doesn't appear necessary 
 to (promise that something will definitely happen or that something will definitely work as described) an income level of income. 
 It's not clear whether crop insurance would improve 
 farmers' access to credit. Farm loans came almost 
 completely from a special one-time credit program targeted specifically at (helping increase/showing in a good way) fruit tree production, 
 and two-thirds of farm families participated in this 
 program. This hints that farmers are at least interested in borrowing money to support and expand their 
 farming businesses/projects. Other farming-based lenders do not 
 appear to be serving farmer needs very well. Closer 
 examination of lender policies is needed to decide/figure out 
 if crop insurance could serve as money and improve 
 access to credit. 
 
 3. A possible insurance program 
 for litchi farmers 
 To test farmers' interest in crop insurance, they 
 were surveyed a second time in September 1998 about 
 participating in a possible insurance program for 
 litchi production. This section describes how the insurance was designed. 
 First, the insurance was selected/named as all-risk 
 insurance, rather than specific-risk insurance. The 
 clearly stated/particular risk that concerned farmers most was the (compared to other things) recent problem of disease talked about/said above. 
 However, an insurance program specifically covering 
 this disease was carefully thought about/believed inappropriate for a few 
 reasons: insurance could create a moral danger/risk in caring for the trees, since management practices affect 
 the disease's event and its treatment; bad 
 selection might be a problem, since farmers alone 
 would know which trees were planted deeply and 
 this way more likely to experience/likely to get disease; and finally, only 2 years 
 of data would make it hard to estimate premiums 
 
 M.L. Vandeveer/ Farming-based Money flow 26 (2001) 173-184 
 
 correctly. Farmers also said they worried about losses 
 due to the weather, but this was expressed as a concern 
 for weather in general terms rather than clearly stated/particular dangers, such as drought, hail, wind, etc. As a result, an 
 all-risk insurance program was carefully thought about/believed most appropriate. 
 Next, should the insurance be based on individual 
 farm yields or some kind of area yield? A few factors 
 suggested that an area-based program would be more 
 appropriate. First, area yield histories were available in 
 the form of district and home yield records, which 
 would be needed to set coverage levels and estimate 
 premiums. Few farmers had almost the same  yield records. Second, the opportunity for stealing/criminal would be much greater 
 with individual coverage, since farmers could easily 
 hide some output and claim a loss. Also, the (related to managing and running a company or organization) cost for watching an very large 
 number of small farmers would be way too high. (in almost the same way), other (related to managing and running a company or organization) costs would be higher with 
 individual coverage, since multiple higher cost schedules would be needed, each farm's yield history would 
 have to be examined in order to assign the appropriate higher cost, and every individual loss would have 
 to be (checked for truth/proved true). These kinds of (related to managing and running a company or organization) costs are 
 greatly reduced in an area-based big plan/layout/dishonest plan, since only 
 the area yield is needed to establish premiums and 
 test losses. 
 Which type of area unit would be most appropriate? To the extent that farm and area yields differ in 
 frequency and (seriousness/ level), area insurance does not provide an effective "yield hedge" (Barnaby and Skees, 
 1990). So, farmers would likely want the area defined in a way such that the area yield tracks closely 
 with their own farm yields. 
 Two area units were used for the possible insurance. The first area was defined as Luc Ngan district, since production conditions and weather patterns 
 are fairly (group of things that are all pretty much the same) over the area. However, out of 
 concern that farmers might fear that the district yield 
 would not reflect their own, Tru Huu home was 
 defined as a second area. This home is one of 
 more than 30 homes in the district, and it is the 
 home where the interviewed farmers lived, greatly 
 reducing any chance that the area yield might differ 
 significantly from their own yields. A few years of 
 yield history were available at both the district level 
 and the home level for setting coverage levels and 
 premiums. 
 
 177 
 
 Yield (promise that something will definitely happen or that something will definitely work as described) levels were set at 90 and 85% 
 of the areas' expected yields. These (compared to other things) high 
 percentages were used because of the low (quality of changing over time or at different places) 
 found in the areas' historical yields. Setting expected 
 area produces and the resulting insurance coverage 
 levels was complicated by the fact that tree working well depends heavily on tree age, and that the planted 
 area contained a large percentage of land with (compared to other things) young trees. So, average yield for an area 
 could change simply due to greater maturity and working well of older trees, or (in the opposite way), 
 due to a large number of young trees just beginning 
 to bear fruit. In other words, while part of the area 
 yield difference/different version is due to weather, disease, pests, and 
 other dangers/risks, another part is due to the changing age 
 distribution and so changing working well of the tree 
 population. Both types of effects must be carefully thought about/believed. 
 In a perfect world, expected area yield could be guessed by 
 a survey deciding/figuring out the percentage of trees in different age categmies, along with guesses of working well typical for each age category. Unfortunately, such 
 information was not available. Expected yields could 
 only be set using the yield histories seen in Tables 1 
 and 2. For the district, the expected yield was set at 
 1.5 t/ha, and for the home, it was 2.4 t/ha. 
 Indemnity payments per sao were defined as an indemnity price times the difference between actual area 
 produce and the area yield (promise that something will definitely happen or that something will definitely work as described) when actual yield 
 is below the (promised that something will definitely happen or that something will definitely work as described) yield. Three indemnity prices 
 were used: 15,000, 25,000, and 35,000 dong/kg. The 
 lowest indemnity price was set close to the (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) 
 market price level, while the two higher indemnity 
 prices were offered in case farmers might be concerned that their own farm loss might be larger than 
 the area's yield loss. In this case, a higher indemnity 
 price makes the indemnity payment larger, this way offsetting the smaller yield loss at the area level. Miranda 
 (1991) and Mahul (1999) provide possible discussions about best coverage levels for area insurance. 
 The payments were based on the yield histories 
 seen in Tables 1 and 2. Yield distributions were fitted 
 to the data, and expected yield losses below the yield 
 (promise that something will definitely happen or that something will definitely work as described) levels were calculated. Due to the very 
 low (quality of changing over time or at different places) in this data, the "pure premiums" (the 
 amounts needed to pay only expected (promises to pay money back for a loss)) 
 were quite low. Two kinds of loads were then added 
 to the total/totally/with nothing else mixed in premiums: the first was a fixed load set at 
 5000 dong/sao for the 15,000 indemnity price, with 
 
 178 
 
 M.L. Vandeveer/ Farming-based Money flow 26 (2001) 173-184 
 
 propmtionately higher amounts added for the other 
 indemnity prices. Then an added 30% load was 
 added to all of these premiums. 
 Two schedules were this way received/got for both the district and home insurance. Payments for the district 
 insurance were (a) little higher than those for the home insurance. In both cases, the premiums for the 
 85% yield (promise that something will definitely happen or that something will definitely work as described) were about two-thirds the amount 
 of those for the 90% yield (promise that something will definitely happen or that something will definitely work as described). In all cases, the 
 premiums were (compared to other things) small in comparison to the 
 expected money/money income; the highest payment for the district 
 insurance was 33,200 dong/sao, only 1.09% of the expected money/money income of 3.055 million dong/sao talked about/said 
 earlier. Even if farmers' yields were much lower, the 
 higher cost would still be in the range of 2-3% of expected money/money income per sao. 
 The insurance was presented as a (something you choose to do, but is not required) program. No talk about/say was made to farmers as to whether 
 it was offered from a private company or through a 
 government (service business/government unit/power/functioning). 
 
 4. Farmer response to area crop insurance 
 In September 1998, staff members of the Teachers/professors of Money flow and (away from cities) Development at Hanoi 
 Farming-based University #1 interviewed the same 100 
 families (related to/looking at/thinking about) their interest in both the district insurance and the home insurance. After 
 explaining how area insurance would work, the staff 
 offered the different insurance contracts to the farmers. 
 
 Specifically, farmers were asked whether they would 
 buy a particular level of coverage or not. With 
 two yield (promise that something will definitely happen or that something will definitely work as described) levels and three indemnity prices, 
 this meant six possible coverage combinations for 
 each type. For each of these combinations, farmers 
 were first asked if they would buy the coverage 
 at the higher high-quality level (pure higher cost + fixed 
 load + 30% load), and if they (lowered in number/got worse/gotten worse), then they 
 were offered the coverage at the lower higher cost (pure 
 higher cost + fixed load). Each household was given a 
 gift of 20,000 dong for participating in the survey. 
 Tables 3 and 4 show the number of farmers buying each of the contracts for the district insurance 
 and the home insurance, (match up each pair of items in order). A few 
 patterns are seen/obvious in these results. First, farmers 
 showed greater interest for the district insurance than 
 for the home insurance. This is surprising at first 
 look, since the home insurance was cheaper and 
 farmers' yields would probably follow the home 
 yield more closely than the district yield. However, 
 the interviewers reported that many farmers believed 
 the expected home yield used to establish the coverage levels was too low, meaning that they thought 
 it was very unlikely that the home yield would 
 ever drop below the yield (promise that something will definitely happen or that something will definitely work as described) levels. 
 This is interesting, (thinking about/when one thinks about) that the 1991-1998 
 average for the home was 2.29 t/ha, while the 
 expected home yield for the insurance program 
 was set at 2.4 t/ha. (thinking about/when one thinks about) that farmers in the 
 sample reported much higher yields than the district 
 or home, the question rises whether farmers

 calculated their yields on the same basis as official 
 statistics (e.g. yield from all trees, only mature trees, 
 only fruit-bearing trees, etc.) and how the official 
 statistics themselves were developed. Some explanations on these issues may have helped farmers better 
 understand the relationship between their own farm 
 produces and area produces and coverage levels. 
 A second pattern in farmer responses is that farmers preferred the 90% yield (promise that something will definitely happen or that something will definitely work as described) level over 
 the 85% yield (promise that something will definitely happen or that something will definitely work as described) level. This might be related to the issue just talked about/said: farmers perceived 
 the chance of area yield falling below 90% 
 of average to be rather low, but the chance of 
 falling below 85% would be even lower. This pattern 
 was true for both district insurance and home 
 insurance. 
 A third result was that the farmers usually preferred 
 lower indemnity prices. A few explanations of this result are possible. One might be that coverage with 
 a higher indemnity price also has a higher higher cost. 
 Another reason might be that farmers did not recognize that a higher indemnity price would provide a 
 higher indemnity in cases when their own yield loss 
 went beyond the area yield loss. It is also possible they 
 believed their own yield losses might follow the area 
 yields very closely, and that a higher indemnity price 
 was unnecessary. No added/more questions measured 
 farmers' beliefs on any of these issues. 
 A fourth result is that farmers were not very (able to reply or react/quick to respond) to reductions in premiums. In most cases, 
 
 reducing the premiums 30% encouraged only a few 
 more farmers to buy the insurance. 
 Participation was over 50% for only one of the district contracts, and was less than 50% for all of the 
 home contracts. However, participation rates are 
 higher when (thinking about/when one thinks about) how many farmers would 
 buy at least one contract. Table 5 shows the number 
 of contracts bought by each farmer - that is, how

 many did not buy any insurance, how many bought at 
 least one contract, two contracts, and so on. For district insurance, the largest category is the category for 
 farmers buying only one contract, with more than 40 
 farmers responding this way. However, only 16 farmers did not buy any contracts at the high high-quality 
 level, and only 11 did not buy any at the low high-quality 
 level. So while farmers rejected most of the contracts, 
 most still said they would buy at least 
 one contract. For home insurance, the pattern is 
 almost the same, although the number of farmers who did not 
 buy any insurance was higher. 
 
 5. An econometric model of insurance demand 
 What were the effects of insurance contract features and farmer (features/ qualities/ traits) on the decisions to buy 
 insurance? To examine this question, binomial logit 
 models were guessed for district and home insurance decisions. There were 1200 (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) for 
 each data set, representing the different combinations of 
 two yield (promise that something will definitely happen or that something will definitely work as described) levels, three indemnity prices, and 
 two higher cost levels. The following section describes 
 the model (numbers that change/things that change) and moving backward results. 
 Three insurance contract features were used as explanatory (numbers that change/things that change): the higher cost, the yield (promise that something will definitely happen or that something will definitely work as described) level, and the indemnity price. One would expect 
 higher premiums to reduce demand for insurance. A 
 higher yield (promise that something will definitely happen or that something will definitely work as described) level represents a higher level 
 of protection, so the coefficient for this (number or thing that changes) should 
 be positive. A higher indemnity price means a higher 
 indemnity payment whenever a loss happens, so a higher 
 indemnity price should increase the demand for insurance (assuming no change in the higher cost). 
 A few farm and farmer (features/ qualities/ traits) were also 
 used in the model. The first two (numbers that change/things that change) were personal (features/ qualities/ traits), years in farming and education. 
 Two types of income (numbers that change/things that change) were also included. The 
 first was the ratio of minimum farm income to average farm income. This changeable measures the risk of 
 having (compared to other things) poor: when this ratio is low, a 
 farmer has more income (quality of changing over time or at different places) and might be more 
 likely to buy insurance. The second income (number or thing that changes) 
 is average total income, which includes both farm and 
 non-farm income. This measures the farmer's total income level, and it should also reflect the wealth 
 of the household, and probably farm size, too. 
 
 Two other (numbers that change/things that change) were used to reflect farmers' 
 attitudes about risk and their responses to risk. The 
 first of these is the number of risks affecting litchi 
 yield that farmers talked about/said on the first survey. These 
 included disease, weather, using outdated technology, 
 and bird damage, meaning the (number or thing that changes) could range 
 from 0 to 4. (in almost the same way), on the first survey farmers were 
 also asked about different management practices they 
 used to reduce risk for litchi. They talked about/said three 
 kinds of responses: using improved (producing crops/helping something grow) methods, using chemicals against pests and disease, and 
 using other inventionss. So, this (number or thing that changes) could range in value from 0 to 3. 
 The final two (numbers that change/things that change) were the number of trees 
 that died in 1997 and 1998, and the standard moving away 
 of litchi yield. Both (numbers that change/things that change) were used to represent 
 litchi yield risk, and both (numbers that change/things that change) should be positively related to higher demand for insurance. 
 The standard moving away oflitchi yield was came/coming from 
 the chance distributions brought out in the first survey. 
 Table 6 summarizes the description of these (numbers that change/things that change) 
 and shows the shortened (number or thing that changes) names used in later 
 tables. 
 The (moving backwards) were (sang, danced, acted, etc., in front of people) on both the district 
 insurance decisions and the home insurance data 
 using the model described above. However, in both 
 cases there was an unexpected result: the coefficient 
 for the higher cost was positive, suggesting that farmers 
 will buy more insurance when the price is higher. A 
 problem of multicollinearity was suspected due to the 
 relationship between a higher higher cost, a higher yield 
 (promise that something will definitely happen or that something will definitely work as described), and a higher indemnity price. In response 
 to this problem, the yield (promise that something will definitely happen or that something will definitely work as described) was instead represented with a dummy (number or thing that changes) defined to be 1 when 
 the yield (promise that something will definitely happen or that something will definitely work as described) was 90% and 0 when it was 85%. 
 (moving backwards) for this changed model were (sang, danced, acted, etc., in front of people) for 
 both types of insurance, and the results seemed more 
 acceptable. 
 Table 7 shows the results for the district insurance 
 decisions. For the insurance contract (numbers that change/things that change), the coefficients for both the higher cost and the yield (promise that something will definitely happen or that something will definitely work as described) have the expected signs and t-statistics significant 
 at the 95% confidence level. The coefficient for the indemnity price is negative, maybe opposite to gut feeling 
 but agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with the patterns watched/followed in Tables 3 
 and 4. It is significant at the 90% confidence level. 
 Among the seven explanatory (numbers that change/things that change) for farm 
 and farmer (features/ qualities/ traits), only three have coefficients

 which are very different from 0 at the 90%

 negative sign. So, other things held constant, farmers with more education were less likely to buy insurance. The second significant coefficient was that 
 for average total income. This hints that richer 
 farmers (who probably also have larger farms), were 
 more likely to buy insurance. The third significant coefficient was that for the number of risks talked about/said 
 for litchi production. Its sign was negative, which surprisingly hints that farmers who talked about/said more 
 types of risk for litchi production were less likely to 
 buy insurance. 
 
 (related to/looking at/thinking about) model summary statistics, the chance 
 ratio statistic for the model as a whole was significant 
 at the 99.9% confidence level. A total of 924 insurance decisions were (described the future) correctly, which is 77% 
 of the 1200 (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements). Most wrong (statements about the future) 
 happened when the farmers did buy insurance but the 
 model (described the future) they would not. 
 Table 8 shows the results of the moving backward for the 
 home insurance decisions. Here, the contract (numbers that change/things that change) have the same signs as in the district results, 
 though the coefficient for the higher cost is not (meaningful numbers). There were somewhat different results for the farm and farmer (features/ qualities/ traits), however.

 The coefficients significant at a 90% confidence level 
 were those for the number of years farming, average 
 total income, and the number of dead trees. Younger 
 farmers, or those with less experience, were less likely 
 to buy home insurance. Farmers with more money were more likely to buy home insurance, 
 almost the same as  the case for district insurance. And farmers 
 with more dead trees in 1997-1998 were also more 
 likely to buy insurance. The ratio of minimum to average income had the expected sign here (farmers with 
 (compared to other things) lower minimum incomes were more likely 
 to buy insurance) and was significant at an 85% confidence level. 
 The summary statistics for the model are just like 
 those for the district case. The chance ratio statistic 
 was highly significant and almost 79% of the insurance decisions were (described the future) correctly. Again, most 
 wrong (statements about the future) happened when the farmers did 
 buy insurance but the model (described the future) they would not. 
 Looking at the two sets of results, the coefficients 
 for the insurance contract (numbers that change/things that change) came out mostly 
 as expected. However, the results related to farm and 
 farmer (features/ qualities/ traits) were rather disappointing. The 
 only clear result seems to be that farmers with higher 
 incomes, who are probably larger, richer farmers, 
 are more likely to buy insurance. Beyond that, it is 
 harder to (describe the future) who might buy insurance. 
 The moving backward coefficients can be converted to a 
 more usable form by calculating values for group 
 choice chance elasticities. These are presented for 
 both district and home models in Table 9. These

 elasticities show the change in the percentage of farmers who would buy insurance when one of the explanatory (numbers that change/things that change) is changed by a small amount. The most 
 important ability to stretch is that for the higher cost, which 
 can be understood/explained (in almost the same way) to a price ability to stretch. For 
 both district and home insurance, the responses 
 to changes in premiums were inelastic; for the district insurance, a 10% reduction in the higher cost would 
 increase participation only 6.8%. For the home 
 insurance, a 10% payment reduction would increase 
 participation about 2.2%. 
 
 6. Some ends/end results 
 This study tested the need for a crop insurance 
 program for litchi production in northern Vietnam and 
 how farmers there might participate in such a program. 
 Two possible insurance plans were developed and 
 presented to them. 
 Results point to/show there is not a strong case for beginning and building on such a crop insurance program. While 
 insurance would reduce the (quality of changing over time or at different places) of farm income, it is not needed to (help increase/show in a good way) adoption of litchi, 
 a very money-making crop, nor is farm income so changeable 
 that farmers' survival/income needs are threatened without insurance. Litchi producers already have incomes 
 (in a big way) above average for farmers in northern 
 Vietnam, so using insurance to provide a helping payment for 
 poorness help would seem to have little good quality/good qualities, 
 too. 
 (related to/looking at/thinking about) insurance design, all-risk insurance 
 based on area yields was carefully thought about/believed the most appropriate form of coverage. The biggest challenge in 
 designing the coverage turned out to be beginning and building on 
 an expected area yield on which to base the yield 
 (promises that something will definitely happen or that something will definitely work as described). Vmiation in tree working well by age and 
 a quickly expanding planted area have the potential 
 to (in a big way) change the area's average yield, quite 
 apart from the effects of weather and other risks. 
 In spite of these (problems, delays, etc.), a majority of farmers 
 were willing to buy some kind of crop insurance if it 
 were available. Farmers clearly preferred higher yield 
 (promises that something will definitely happen or that something will definitely work as described) and lower indemnity prices. Even after 
 some significant loading, the premiums, which were 
 based on each area's yield history, were (compared to other things) low 
 compared to the typical amount of money/money income that litchi 
 production can create. Farmer response to premium 
 
 M.L. Vandeveer/ Farming-based Money flow 26 (2001) 173-184 
 
 changes was inelastic. Other factors, such as farmers' 
 perceptions about yield coverage levels, were probably more important in their buying decisions. Farmers 
 with more money were more likely to buy insurance, but the relationship between insurance demand 
 and other farmer (features/ qualities/ traits) was less clear. 
 It should be given special attention that this research did not 
 carefully study some important parts of insurance program 
 (ability to be done). For example, marketing methods, program 
 staffing needs, operating costs, and the amount of 
 reserves needed/demanded for very bad losses would also 
 need to be tested. (related to managing and running a company or organization) costs of crop insurance programs in developing countries appear to 
 change/differ  widely. For example, Mishra's (1996) study of 
 India's area-based big plan/layout/dishonest plan found that (related to managing and running a company or organization) 
 costs accounted for less than 4% of total program 
 costs (p. 266); in contrast, the Philippines' crop insurance program had a loss ratio of 0.41 in 1996 but 
 still needed/demanded helping payment to cover its (related to managing and running a company or organization) costs 
 (Philippine Crop Insurance Corporation, 1997). 
 The other major possible cost of the program, 
 of course, relates to the math-related soundness of the 
 insurance. Setting correct area yield coverage levels would be important to math-related performance, as 
 (not in a natural way/in a fake way) high values could lead to inappropriate indemnity payments. The premiums used in the study 
 carried significant loads and would reflect some margin for error; the most popular coverage level chosen 
 by farmers had what amounted to a 46% load on 
 top of the total/totally/with nothing else mixed in higher cost, while other coverage levels 
 carried even higher loads. Even so, probably only 
 a few years of experience could show whether the 
 rates were in fact (good) enough. 
 Further analysis of these issues was not begun/tried 
 because the other arguments for beginning and building on an insurance program were not especially strong. Farm 
 families watched/followed in this survey can continue to 
 deal with risk through current practices, such as 
 household savings, a bit of business/project (getting involved with different types of things; not sticking with only one thing), 
 good production practices, borrowing from relatives, 
 and so on. And Vietnamese government investment in 
 farming-based programs would probably be best directed 
 in other places. 
 In end/end result, a few (big statements based on very little information) about insurance in a developing country big picture  are also attempted/traveled. 
 First, area-based insurance offers some important advantages but also has some possible (bad results or effects). It is 
 hard to overestimate the importance of beginning and building on 
 
 183 
 
 appropriate values for the expected area produces and the 
 related insurance coverage levels, both for (accomplishing or gaining) 
 significant farmer participation and for avoiding math-related problems. Related to this, it seems worthwhile 
 to test farmers' perceptions (related to/looking at/thinking about) area average 
 produce and area yield (quality of changing over time or at different places), as well as farmers' 
 perceptions of the relationship between their own 
 produces and area yields. Some educational effort might 
 be needed to correct any mistakes in thinking. Some added/more farmer education might also be needed to secure/make sure of 
 they understand when to use a higher indemnity price. 
 From a wider policy standpoint, the costs and benefits of beginning and building on a crop insurance program must 
 naturally be compared with those of other farming-based 
 programs. Because government spending on farming so often faces serious limits in developing countries, investing in a crop insurance program might be 
 worthwhile only in more important cases, after careful 
 (act of asking questions and trying to find the truth about something) points to/shows its value.
