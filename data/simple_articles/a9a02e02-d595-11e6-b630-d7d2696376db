 Abstract 
 This article examines how expected changes in climate are likely to affect farming in China. The effects of temperature and (rain, snow, etc.) on net 
 crop money/money income are carefully studied using thin sliceal data consisting of both rainfed and watered farms. Based on survey data from 8,405 families 
 across 28 areas, the results suggest that worldwide  warming is likely to be harmful to rainfed farms but helpful to watered farms. The net 
 hits/effects will be only mildly harmful at first, but the damages will grow over time. The hits/effects also change/differ  by area. Farms in the Southeast will 
 only be mildly affected but farms in the Northeast and Northwest will carry/hold the  largest damages. However, the study does not take by force/take control of the indirect 
 effects on farms of possible changes in water flow, which may be important in China.

 1. Introduction 
 As scientific (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) becomes more convincing that increasing pollution (that heats up the Earth) will warm the planet (IPCC, 2007a), it 
 has become ever more important to understand the hits/effects of 
 worldwide  warming. The hits/effects to the farm-related part/area from 
 climate change are among the largest and best recorded/supported. 
 (related to scientific farming) studies suggest that crop yields may fall if the 
 same crops are grown in the same places under different climate 
 change pictures/situations (IPCC, 2007b). Even with helpful change, studies 
 applying the Ricardian approach in Africa (Kurukulasuriya and 
 Mendelsohn, 2008; Kurukulasuriya et al., 2006) and South 
 America (Seo and Mendelsohn, 2008) suggest that warming 
 will reduce farm net money/money income. Further, climate change will 
 have different hits/effects on different countries. 
 Many (related to scientific farming) modeling studies have tested the hits/effects 
 of climate change on a few grain crops (e.g., rice, maize, and 
 wheat) in different areas of China. The general findings of 
 these studies are that crop yields will fall in China like those 
 in other developing countries (e.g., Matthews and Wassmann,

 2003; Avoid et al., 2004; Tao et al., 2006; Wu et al., 2006; 
 Xiong et al., 2007; Yao et al., 2007). These and other (related to scientific farming) 
 studies have the same warning in that they assume that the same 
 crops are grown in the same places as climate changes. Further, 
 (related to scientific farming) studies in China do not include any money-based values 
 attached to the guessed yield reductions. And, there are no 
 agroeconomic models (such as Adams et al., 1995) that convert 
 crop-modeling results into money-based results for China. 
 The only money-based study in China to date of the effect of 
 warming on farming is a Ricardian analysis (Liu et al., 2004). 
 Curiously, this study finds that warming will increase average 
 farm net money/money income, not reduce it. However, this Ricardian study 
 is based on county-level data with possibly extreme data limits. Therefore, it is hard to weigh the results of this study 
 and compare them to the results of the other (related to scientific farming) studies 
 that suggest that warming is harmful. In short, there is simply 
 not (enough information or physical objects that clearly prove something) to know how worldwide  warming will affect 
 Chinese farming. 
 To help answer this question, this article reports the results 
 of a new study that measures the sensitivity of Chinese farming to warming, employing farm-level data. Like the Liu et al. 
 (2004) study, the analysis in this article depends on the Ricardian 
 method (Mendelsohn et al., 1994). The analysis is conducted

 on 8,405 farms sampled across 28 areas. The data include 
 information on each farm's money-based operations and other 
 farm/household (features/ qualities/ traits). Matching the location of each 
 household to climate data (rainfall and temperature) and soils, 
 it is possible to examine the effect of climate on net money/money income 
 controlling for many other factors. By moving backward net money/money income 
 per hectare on climate and some other (coming from the outside of something) control (numbers that change/things that change), we guess the sensitivity of current Chinese 
 farms to climate. The econometric results allow us to guess 
 the direct effects of temperature and (rain, snow, etc.) on crop net 
 money/money income. Further, the results are combined with future climate 
 pictures/situations to (describe the future) how future changes in climate might affect 
 farmers. 
 Unfortunately, the amount of crop-watering/rinsing with water water a farmer uses 
 is not available in the data set. Although for many farms we 
 know whether a farm is watered or not, we do not know water 
 availability or the cost of water. If future climate pictures/situations reduce available water supplies, this is likely to have an important 
 harmful effect on China's farming that this study does not 
 take into account. Future studies should address the indirect 
 effect of climate change on crop net money/money income. Future studies 
 should also try to (describe the future) how China's farms might change over 
 time with new technology and capital. 
 2. Way(s) of doing things 
 The Ricardian approach (Mendelsohn et al., 1994) is the 
 first (or most important) method that we use in the analysis in this article. The 
 Ricardian model assumes that each farmer wishes to (make as big as possible) 
 income, subject to the (coming from the outside of something) conditions of his or her farm. 
 Specifically, the farmer chooses the crop and inputs for each 
 unit of land that (makes as big as possible): 
 Pqi Qi (Xi , Li , Ki , IRi , C, W, S) a' 
 
 Max Ï = 
 i 
 
 Px Xi 
 i 
 
 a' 
 
 PL Li a' 
 i 
 
 PK Ki a' 
 i 
 
 (1) 
 
 PIR IRi , 
 i 
 
 where Ï is net once-a-year income, Pqi is the market price of crop i, 
 Qi is a production function for crop i, Xi is a vector of once-a-year 
 inputs such as seeds, (material that makes plants grow better), and bug-killers for each crop i, 
 Li is a vector of labor (hired and household) for each crop i, Ki 
 is a vector of capital such as tractors and collecting equipment 
 for each crop i, C is a vector of climate (numbers that change/things that change), IRi is a vector 
 of crop-watering/rinsing with water choices for each crop i, W is available water for 
 crop-watering/rinsing with water, S is a vector of soil (features/ qualities/ traits), Px is a vector of 
 prices for the once-a-year inputs, PL is a vector of prices for each 
 type of labor, PK is the rental price of capital, and PIR is the 
 once-a-year cost of each type of crop-watering/rinsing with water system. 
 If the farmer chooses the crop that provides the highest net 
 income and chooses each endogenous input in order to (make as big as possible) net income, the resulting net income will be a function of 
 just the (coming from the outside of something) (numbers that change/things that change): 
 Ï a-- = f (Pq , C, W, S, PX , PL , PK , PIR ). 
 
 (2) 
 
 With perfect competition for land, free entry and exit will 
 secure/make sure of that excess (money made/good things received) are driven to zero. As a result, 
 land rents will be equal to net income per hectare (Mendelsohn 
 et al., 1994; Ricardo, 1817). 
 The Ricardian function is meant to be a center  of the most 
 money-making crops with respect to each (coming from the outside of something) (number or thing that changes) such 
 as temperature. The net income function does not include less 
 money-making other choices. It as a result does not look like the 
 response function for any single crop but rather as the envelope 
 of all choices. For example, at cool temperatures, farmers would 
 choose to grow wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). As temperatures 
 rise, farmers would no longer want to grow wheat because it 
 would become less money-making. They instead would move/change to maize 
 (Zea mays L.). As temperatures increase further, they might 
 want to move/change to fruit (Panicum miliaceum) or vegetables that are 
 more heat tolerant. The Ricardian function, Eq. (2), takes by force/takes control of the 
 center  of highest (money made/good things received) for each temperature or (rain, snow, etc.) 
 level. It is guessed across crops and across inputs, showing the 
 net effect of changing the (coming from the outside of something) (number or thing that changes). Because farmers 
 are assumed to make helpful changes that are money-making, the method 
 automatically (takes control of) the helpful change built into the market 
 (Mendelsohn et al., 1994). 
 The Ricardian model was developed to explain the difference/different version in land value per hectare of cropland over climate zones 
 (Mendelsohn et al., 1994). In repeated studies in the United 
 States, Brazil, Sri Skinnya, and South America, the land value 
 per hectare of cropland has been found to be sensitive to seasonal (rain, snow, etc.) and temperature (Mendelsohn and Dinar, 
 1999, 2003; Seo and Mendelsohn, 2008; Seo et al., 2005). In 
 some countries, land markets do not function and so there 
 are no land values. Instead, net money/money income per unit of land is 
 calculated. Almost the same  results have also been found for crop net 
 money/money income in India, Africa, South America, and Israel (Fleischer et al., 2008; Kurukulasuirya et al., 2006; Mendelsohn and 
 Dinar, 1999; Seo and Mendelsohn, 2008). Because the response 
 is (not going in a straight line), a quadratic functional form has been used in most 
 Ricardian studies. 
 Note that the Ricardian model does not take into account 
 price changes (Cline, 1996) and so will overestimate welfare 
 effects. However, the prices of crops are serious and stubborn around the world, 
 not locally, so the key is the effect of climate on worldwide  production. With the (act of something getting bigger, wider, etc.) of crop production in some parts of 
 the world and the contraction in others, the changes in the price 
 of crops from worldwide  warming is expected to be small (IPCC, 
 2007b). Also, the Ricardian analysis does not take into account 
 the cost of change (Kelly et al., 2005). The analysis is measuring long-term balance effects, not short-run change 
 costs. 
 
 3. Data and model (detailed descriptions of exactly what is required) 
 The climate data (monthly temperature and (rain, snow, etc.)) 
 were gathered from the National Weather-related Information 
 Center in China. The data are based on actual measurements in 
 
 J. Wang et al./Agricultural Money flow 40 (2009) 323-337 
 
 753 national weather-related stations that are located throughout 
 China. The temperature and (rain, snow, etc.) data were collected 
 from 1951 to 2001. We depend on the mean values of these (numbers that change/things that change) (climate (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy)) over this period for each month. The 
 climate for each county is assumed to be the value measured by 
 that county's weather-related station. 
 Because of the high relationship in the climate data from 
 month to month, it is not possible to include every month in 
 the econometric analysis. As a result, the monthly data are 
 averaged into four seasons. Winter is the average of December 
 to February; spring is the average of March to May; summer 
 is the average of June to August; and fall is the average of 
 September to November. 
 The (how money affects people's lives) data that are used in the study come from 
 China's National Bureau of Statistics (CNBS). The data were 
 collected by a highly trained, professional list staff 
 in 2001 as part of the once-a-year, nationwide Household Income 
 and Expense Survey (HIES). 1 The data cover 45,700 farm 
 families in 4,365 villages, 533 counties, and 31 areas. 
 During the survey enumerators from CNBS collected a rich 
 set of information at both the village and the household levels. 
 Most importantly the data provide us with a (compared to other things) highquality measure for the (thing that changes (like a test score) because of something else that you control (like study time)), net crop money/money income for 
 each household. Net crop money/money income is gross crop money/money income (or total 
 sales for each crop) less than all expenses for production, 
 including expenses on seed, (material that makes plants grow better), crop-watering/rinsing with water, bug-killer, 
 machinery, plastic sheeting, hired labor, and custom services. 
 All of the output that was ate/destroyed by each household was 
 given a value based on a price of the output as if it was sold 
 available to buy. Neither family labor nor a household's rent for 
 contracted land is counted as a cost. Therefore, net money/money income is a 
 measure of returns to land and family labor. Based on the total 
 (helped to grow) land area of each household (measured in hectares), 
 we can calculate net crop money/money income per hectare. 
 The data set also includes some other household and 
 village (features/ qualities/ traits). These (numbers that change/things that change) are important from a 
 possible point of view since they can give us measures of fixed 
 factors that belong in Ricardian (moving backwards). Using the data, we 
 can construct (numbers that change/things that change) that measure the education level 
 of members of the farm household, each family's land area, a 
 number of indicators about the (related to land and maps) (surrounding conditions) of 
 each village (e.g., if it is located on a plain or in a huge 
 area), each household's crop-watering/rinsing with water status (measured as the 
 share of area that is watered in the village) and the ease of 
 access to markets (e.g., the presence of paved roads between 
 the village and key services; the distance to each township's 
 main government office). Such (numbers that change/things that change) are used as control 
 (numbers that change/things that change) in the (moving backwards). Descriptive statistics of the key 
 (numbers that change/things that change) are shown in Table 1. The table provides key data 
 about the whole sample as well as three important subsamples: 
 farms from villages that are watered, farms from villages that 
 1 2001 is (well enough/good enough/in a smart way) representative. The crop yield, net money/money income per hectare, 
 and crop marketing price for three major crops (wheat, maize, and rice) in 2001 
 are agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with the values in China from 1990 to 2005. 
 
 325 
 
 are rainfed, and farms from villages that have both watered and 
 rainfed farms. 2 
 In addition to information about climate and (how money affects people's lives) 
 conditions, the (features/ qualities/ traits) of a area's soils also are important (things that decide other things) of net crop money/money income. To account for soils, we 
 depend on a soils map from FAO's website. There are three major 
 soil types--clay, sand, and soil  soils. The final set of (numbers that change/things that change) 
 for our analysis was created by creating a (number or thing that changes) measuring 
 the share of (helped to grow) area with each type of soil. These soil 
 (numbers that change/things that change) are used directly in the moving backward. We also include 
 county elevation data. 
 In order to go ahead with our analysis of the effect of climate 
 on farming, we need to match the climate data with the (how money affects people's lives) data of each farmer. Although there are 752 counties with weather-related stations and 533 counties in which 
 CNBS collected HIES data, in only 124 counties there are both 
 weather-related stations and CNBS samples. In order to secure/make sure of 
 that we have a (compared to other things) good match between the crop money/money income 
 (and other (how money affects people's lives)) data and climate information, we 
 restrict our sample to only those families in counties with 
 weather-related stations. In total, our final sample has 8,405 
 families in 915 villages, in 124 counties in 28 areas. 3 
 By depending on the measurements of climate in the weather-related stations, we avoid some of the climate figuring out 
 problems faced by previous Ricardian studies. 
 3.1. Model (detailed descriptions of exactly what is required) 
 In order to take (prisoner) by force the expected (not going in a straight line) relationship between net money/money income and climate, we specify the following model 
 to examine the hits/effects of climate change on farming in 
 China: 
 V = b0 + b1 Â· T + b2 Â· T 2 + b3 Â· P + b4 Â· P 2 
 + 
 
 dj Â· Zj + e, 
 
 (3) 
 
 j 
 
 where the (thing that changes (like a test score) because of something else that you control (like study time)), V, is crop net money/money income per hectare 
 (as defined above). The (numbers that change/things that change) T and P represent vectors of 
 temperature and (rain, snow, etc.) (with one (number or thing that changes) for temperature 
 and one (number or thing that changes) for (rain, snow, etc.) for each of the four seasons). 
 Also, we include a vector, Z, of county-, village-, and 
 household-level (how money affects people's lives) and other control (numbers that change/things that change). Included in Z are our measures of soil type, elevation of the 
 county, land (1 if the village is located on a plain and 0 if 
 the village is on a mountain), the share of a village's (helped to grow) 
 area that is watered, a dummy for access to markets (1 if there 
 is a road that connects the village to the outside world and 0 
 if there is not), and a (number or thing that changes) measuring the distance between 
 2 
 
 Rainfed is defined as a farm that depends only on rainwater and has no other 
 source of water. 
 3 In order to match the climate data and household data, we dropped those 
 families in counties without a weather station. Also, we dropped those 
 families that did not help grow any crops (showed with total cropping 
 spread around areas of zero).

 the village and township government. There are also a series 
 of household-level (numbers that change/things that change) in Z, including the average education level of each member of the household that is in the labor 
 force, a household's land area, and a dummy (number or thing that changes) measuring 
 whether or not a household belongs to a production cooperative. The symbols bk and dj are vectors of the coefficients to be 
 guessed; e is an error term. 
 In order to test the strength of the model, we try some other choice (detailed descriptions of exactly what is required) of Eq. (3). For example, we also 
 try using the log of net money/money income as the (thing that changes (like a test score) because of something else that you control (like study time)). We 
 test whether (rain, snow, etc.) and temperature are independent by 
 adding climate interaction terms. We divide the sample between 
 families that live in watered and rainfed villages and guess separate (moving backwards) for each subsample (Schlenker et al., 
 2005). As in Schlenker et al. (2005), we assume that in this 
 analysis the choice of crop-watering/rinsing with water is (coming from the outside of something). 
 Based on this model, the change in land value from a not important 
 change in temperature or (rain, snow, etc.) tested at a particular 
 vector of seasonal temperatures T or (rain, snow, etc.) P is:

 aVi 
 = b3 + 2 Â· b4 Â· P .

 With four seasons, one can calculate the not important hit/effect of 
 each season. The not important effect depends on the level of temperature and (rain, snow, etc.). We present the results for the mean 
 temperature and (rain, snow, etc.) in the sample. While seasonal effects might be of some interest, the more related expression 
 for studying worldwide  warming is the overall change in once-a-year 
 climate. The once-a-year average not important effect can be calculated 
 as the sum of the average seasonal not important effects across all 
 farms. 
 
 4. Results 
 In Table 2, we explore a moving backward model of net money/money income per 
 hectare on climate, soils, and some farm (numbers that change/things that change). We 
 examine this moving backward for four samples: all the farms (some of 
 which are not defined as watered rainfed (see below), farms that 
 are watered, farms that are rainfed, and farms that are either watered or rainfed. The first moving backward includes 8,405 farms, the 
 second 2,750 watered farms, the third 2,119 rainfed farms, and 
 the last moving backward includes 4,869 farms from the last two subsamples (2,750 + 2,119). There are about 3,500 farms 
 in villages with a mix of rainfed and watered farms where 
 we cannot decide/figure out whether the farm is watered or not. The

 goodness of fit measures ((changed to make better/changed to fit new conditions) R2 ) for all of the models 
 ranges from 0.16 to 0.25, a level that is (compared to other things) high for 
 thin sliceal household data. 4 
 The analysis of all farms shown in the first column in Table 2 
 shows/tells about that many of the control (numbers that change/things that change) are highly significant. 
 Clay and silt soils increase net money/money income per hectare (compared 
 to sand). It is good for a farmer to be on a plain, have 
 access to a road, and participate in a production association. It 
 is bad (lower net money/money income per hectare) for a farm 
 to be a larger size or higher elevation. The effect of size may 
 be an object of the (something left out) of household labor as a cost. 
 Other factors such as whether the village has more watered 
 land, laborers with less education, or is closer to the township 
 government are not significant. 5 
 Most important for this article are the results for the climate 
 (numbers that change/things that change). At least one of the climate (numbers that change/things that change) is significant 
 in every season except for fall temperature and summer (rain, snow, etc.). Many of the coefficients of the squared terms are 
 significant, suggesting that climate effects are (not going in a straight line). However, the quadratic nature of the climate (numbers that change/things that change) makes the 
 coefficients themselves hard to understand/explain. As a result, in 
 Table 3, we calculate the not important hits/effects of climate using 
 both the linear and the squared coefficients of each (number or thing that changes). The 
 first column of Table 3 presents the once-a-year not important temperature and (rain, snow, etc.) effects, calculated at the sample mean, 
 for the whole sample. The results suggest that higher once-a-year 
 temperatures (a) little reduce net money/money income per hectare in China 
 (a'10 USD/a--¦ C). The overall temperature ability to stretch is a'0.09 
 (% change in net money/money income/% change in temperature). Agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with earlier Ricardian analyses, the seasonal temperature 
 effects are larger and offsetting. Higher spring temperatures are 
 harmful, whereas warmer summer and especially winter temperatures are helpful. 6 Higher once-a-year (rain, snow, etc.) increases 
 net money/money income (+15 USD/mm/mo). The overall (rain, snow, etc.) ability to stretch is +0.8 (% change in net money/money income/% change in (rain, snow, etc.)). As with the seasonal temperature effects, the seasonal 
 (rain, snow, etc.) effects are larger and offsetting. A wetter spring 
 is harmful, whereas a wetter winter is helpful. 
 We also examine some other choice (detailed descriptions of exactly what is required) in Table A.1 and Table A.2 in the Add on. Specifically, we focus 
 on the model with the log of net money/money income as the (thing that changes (like a test score) because of something else that you control (like study time)). This model yields consistent coefficients and higher F-test 
 
 4 The (changed to make better/changed to fit new conditions) R2 of our guess results are also almost the same as  that in 
 other countries, for example, in the research of Africa (Kurukulasuriya and 
 Mendelson, 2008) the (changed to make better/changed to fit new conditions) R2 is 0.35; for Brazil and India, it is 0.40 and 
 0.56, separately (Mendelson et al., 2007). 
 5 The closeness to township government may not matter because townships 
 are small or government is not. The amount of crop-watering/rinsing with water in the village may 
 not matter if it does not reflect the crop-watering/rinsing with water on the farm itself. Finally, the 
 education of laborers may not matter because better educated laborers may cost 
 more. 
 6 For both spring wheat and early rice in China, their planting seasons are 
 from February to April. If the winter temperature is warmer, their planting 
 seasons can begin earlier.

 values. 7The model also does a better job with heteroscedasticity, explaining some (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) with much higher net money/money income 
 per hectare than the sample average. However, it is important 
 to note that the log model produces almost the same  results to the linear 
 model. We also explored other choice (detailed descriptions of exactly what is required) that control 
 for land per household. The results are strong. When including 
 either the log of land or when including a quadratic term for 
 land, the overall climate results are almost the same. A third important 
 version that we explored concerns adding climate interaction 
 terms between temperature and (rain, snow, etc.). We found that 
 these terms were generally unimportant except for the fall season. However, adding interaction terms confuses the role of 
 temperature and (rain, snow, etc.) so that not important effects depend on 
 both (numbers that change/things that change). For simpleness, we depend on the model presented 
 in this article. However, even when interactions are included, 
 the overall results are strong across the different (detailed descriptions of exactly what is required). 
 Because of the importance of crop-watering/rinsing with water in China, it is helpful 
 to understand the sensitivity of watered against/compared to/or rainfed farms (as 
 first suggested by Schlenker et al., 2005). Earlier research has 
 pointed to/showed that watered and rainfed farms have different climate 
 sensitivities in Africa (Kurukulasuriya and Mendelsohn, 2007) 
 and South America (Seo and Mendelsohn, 2008). As a result, 
 in this article we examine the subsamples of farms that were 
 in watered villages and the subsamples of farms that were in 
 rainfed villages. Farms that were in villages that had both were 
 left out because we could not identify whether the farm used 
 crop-watering/rinsing with water. After dividing the sample, we then guessed the net 
 money/money income model on the two subsamples as shown in columns 2 
 and 3 of Table 2. We also guessed the moving backward for the two 
 subsamples combined in column 4 of Table 2.

 It is necessary to note that logging the data will move it closer to the mean, 
 automatically improving the R2 and F-test value. 
 
 J. Wang et al./Agricultural Money flow 40 (2009) 323-337 
 
 Comparing columns 2 and 3 in Table 2, most of the coefficients of the control (numbers that change/things that change) for rainfed and watered farms are 
 not almost the same as  each other. The one exception is that larger plots 
 for both samples have lower net money/money income. Other (numbers that change/things that change) such 
 as percent clay soil, distance to township government, share of 
 labor that is uneducated, and farmer (features/ qualities/ traits) remain unimportant. But the watered and rainfed (moving backwards) often had 
 very different coefficients. Silt soil and participating in 
 a production association increased the net money/money income of watered 
 land but had no significant effect on rainfed land. Being on a 
 plain increased the value of rainfed land but decreased the value 
 of watered land. Being on a road increased the value of rainfed 
 land but had no effect on watered land. Higher elevation decreased the value of rainfed land but had no effect on watered 
 land. 
 The coefficients of the (related to the Earth's weather) (numbers that change/things that change) for the rainfed and 
 watered (moving backwards) in Table 2 were also different. Many of 
 the climate coefficients are still significant. Some had the same 
 sign though not the same importance. Finally, some coefficients 
 switched sign, such as fall temperature, summer (rain, snow, etc.), 
 and fall (rain, snow, etc.). However, to judge the effect of climate, it 
 is helpful to calculate the not important hits/effects. The results, shown 
 in columns 2 and 3 of Table 3, show/tell about that temperature has a 
 basically different effect on watered against/compared to/or rainfed farming. Higher once-a-year temperatures increase the net money/money income of 
 watered farms by +68 USD/a--¦ C but reduce the net money/money income of 
 rainfed farms by a'95 USD/a--¦ C. The seasonal effects are also different. Warmer falls are especially harmful to watered farms, 
 whereas warmer summers and winters are helpful. In contrast, warmer springs and falls are harmful to rainfed farms, 
 whereas warmer winters are helpful. Higher once-a-year (rain, snow, etc.), however, has almost identical effects on watered and 
 rainfed farms. Wetter weather increase watered net money/money income by 
 27 USD/mm/mo and rainfed net money/money income by 23 USD/mm/mo. 
 Both watered and rainfed farms succeed more than the full 
 sample moving backward suggests. The lower not important values in the 
 full sample may be due to a measurement error because the full 
 cost of crop-watering/rinsing with water is not measured. As rain increases, farmers 
 find it money-making to switch from crop-watering/rinsing with water to rainfed farming 
 (or reduce the watered water they use) to save crop-watering/rinsing with water costs. 
 In practice, they earn more. But using this data without crop-watering/rinsing with water costs, it appears that they are switching from high-valued 
 crop-watering/rinsing with water to low-valued rainfed farming. 
 It is also interesting to compare the results for the moving backward 
 with both watered and rainfed farms (column 4 in Table 2) with 
 the results of the two independent (moving backwards) (columns 2 and 
 3). For most of the coefficients, the sign and importance of the 
 (number or thing that changes) in the combined moving backward depends on the significant 
 coefficient in the two independent (moving backwards). For example, the 
 helpful effect of silt soil in the watered moving backward makes silt 
 soil helpful in the combined moving backward. Almost the same  (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) can 
 be found for closeness to a road, participating in a production 
 association and elevation. Finally, some (numbers that change/things that change) (such as distance to township government, education, and helped grow land 
 per household) have the same sign and importance in all three 
 
 329 
 
 (moving backwards). There are two exceptions to this rule. Clay soil is 
 not significant in either the watered or the rainfed (moving backwards) 
 but it is significant in the combined moving backward. Being on a plain 
 is significant in both independent (moving backwards) but with opposite 
 signs, so it is not significant in the combined moving backward. 
 The sign and importance of the climate (numbers that change/things that change) (seasonal 
 temperature and (rain, snow, etc.)) in the combined moving backward also 
 mainly depend on the significant coefficient in the two independent (moving backwards). The not important results in Table 3 clearly 
 demonstrate where there are offsetting results. For example, 
 warmer temperature increases net money/money income by 68 USD/mm/mo 
 for watered farms and reduces net money/money income by 95 USD/mm/mo 
 for rainfed farms. Combining these two samples together, 
 the net money/money income only increases by 8 USD/mm/mo. (in almost the same way), 
 more (rain, snow, etc.) produces a (a) little smaller benefit in the 
 combined sample than for either watered or rainfed farms 
 alone. 
 The climate results are the most important results of the 
 article. At least one of the climate (numbers that change/things that change) is significant in 
 every season except for fall temperature and summer (rain, snow, etc.). Many of the coefficients of the squared terms are significant, suggesting that climate effects are (not going in a straight line). However, the 
 quadratic nature of the climate (numbers that change/things that change) makes the coefficients 
 themselves hard to understand/explain. As a result, in Table 3, we calculate the not important hits/effects of climate using both the linear and 
 the squared coefficients of each (number or thing that changes). The first column of 
 Table 3 presents the once-a-year not important temperature and (rain, snow, etc.) effects, calculated at the sample mean, for the whole sample. 
 The results suggest that higher once-a-year temperatures (a) little reduce net money/money income per hectare in China (a'10 USD/a--¦ C). The 
 overall temperature ability to stretch is a'0.09 (% change in net money/money income/% change in temperature). Agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with earlier Ricardian analyses, the seasonal temperature effects are larger and 
 offsetting. Higher spring temperatures are harmful, whereas 
 warmer summer and especially winter temperatures are helpful. 8 Higher once-a-year (rain, snow, etc.) increases net money/money income (+15 
 USD/mm/mo). The overall (rain, snow, etc.) ability to stretch is +0.8 (% 
 change in net money/money income/% change in (rain, snow, etc.)). As with the 
 seasonal temperature effects, the seasonal (rain, snow, etc.) effects 
 are larger and offsetting. A wetter spring is harmful, whereas a 
 wetter winter is helpful. 
 4.1. (related to a large area) hits/affects 
 Although the average effect of temperature is negative and 
 the not important effect of (rain, snow, etc.) is positive, the effects are 
 quite different in different areas of the country. In order to understand how climate hits/effects change/differ  across China, the not important 
 hits/effects of temperature and (rain, snow, etc.) are mapped for watered and rainfed farms. The not important temperature results 
 of the crop-watering/rinsing with water moving backward are shown in Fig. 1. With watered

 seasons can begin earlier.

 farms, warmer temperatures are more helpful in the southeast 
 and southwest areas (128-255 USD/ha/a--¦ C). Further, watered 
 farms in the far south are no longer harmed by warming. However, the rest of China has almost the same  results. Farms in the central 
 area continue to enjoy mild benefits from warming (up to 127 
 USD/ha/a--¦ C). The far north has the same not important damages. The 
 not important (rain, snow, etc.) effects for watered farms are shown in 
 Fig. 2. The damages in the wet southeast disappear and become 
 small benefits. All watered farms in China enjoy small benefits 
 from increased rain. 
 The not important temperature results of the rainfed farm moving backward are shown in Fig. 3. The temperature hits/effects show a 
 marked (development or increase over time/series of events or things) moving from the far south to the far north. 
 There are large damages (a'166 to a'331 USD/ha/a--¦ C) in the 
 far south from warming. These turn into smaller damages in 
 most of the rest of the country (up to a'165 USD/ha/a--¦ C). The 
 far north and a few cold places in the southeast get small gains 
 from warming (up to 127 USD/ha/a--¦ C). The results suggest that 
 most of China is (a) little too warm for rainfed farming. Any 
 further warming is therefore harmful except in the far north. 
 
 The not important (rain, snow, etc.) effects are shown in Fig. 4. Increased rain will damage rainfed farms in the wet southeast but 
 benefit rainfed farms in the rest of the country. 
 
 4.2. Climate tests 
 In order to get a sense of the hit/effect of future climate 
 changes, we test out climate change hits/effects using the econometric model described above. The (testing out) is 
 just a first step since it assumes that China's farms will remain 
 as they are now. Clearly this will not be the case as future 
 farmers make many changes across the (wide view of a nature scene/wide area of beautiful land). However, 
 the analysis of the hit/effect of future climate pictures/situations on today's 
 farms does at least give a sense of the importance of climate 
 change. 
 In this study, we look at the results of three climate models: 
 Parallel Climate Model (PCM), Hadley CM3 (Hadley), and 
 the Canadian Climate Centre (CCC) model. Although they do 
 not give a complete range of possible hits/effects, the three models

 were chosen to reflect a broad range of climate sensitivities. The 
 2100 average (statement about the future) for temperature change in China this way 
 ranges from 2.5a--¦ C in the PCM model to 4.0a--¦ C in the Hadley 
 model, and 4.1a--¦ C in the CCC model. The models also provide 
 different guesses of the change in (rain, snow, etc.) as shown in 
 Table 4. 
 The national results are quite different in each picture/situation. The 
 damages are much smaller in the (compared to other things) mild PCM picture/situation. 
 However, in the Hadley and CCC pictures/situations, the damages are 
 much larger. The hits/effects grow over time as the warming continues. By 2100, the damages reach 700 USD/ha in the Hadley 
 picture/situation. The hits/effects, however, change/differ  a great deal by farm type. 
 Climate change is helpful to watered farms as they can change 
 to the extra heat by using more water. Of course, this result is 
 based on the condition that there is more water to use. Rainfed farms, in contrast, are hurt immediately by climate change 
 and the damages strengthen with time. 
 The results are not uniform across areas. The Southeast 
 is much less (changed by/affected by) climate change as there is enough 
 rainfall to offset the extra heat in this area. The Northeast and 
 Northwest, in contrast, are very sensitive to warming. 
 
 5. End/end result and policy effects/results/suggestions 
 This study manages and does a Ricardian analysis on 8,405 farm 
 families across 28 areas in China. Net money/money income are moved backward on seasonal climate and some control (numbers that change/things that change). 
 A few (detailed descriptions of exactly what is required) of the model are guessed. The scientific 
 results are strong. The average hit/effect of higher temperatures 
 is negative and the average hit/effect of more (rain, snow, etc.) is positive. However, not important increases in temperature and rainfall 
 have very different effects on different farm types in different 
 areas. Warming is helpful to watered farmers in China 
 as they can use water to offset the heat. Rainfed farmers, in 
 contrast, are quite able to be hurt by warming and they will suffer 
 reductions in net money/money income. More rain is likely to be harmful to 
 rainfed farmers in the wet southeast but will benefit farmers in 
 the remaining areas. Watered farmers, like rainfed farmers, 
 will gain from increased rainfall. 
 These basic results are just like results from other countries 
 (Kurukulasuriya et al., 2006; Mendelsohn and Dinar, 2003; 
 Mendelsohn et al., 1994, 2001; Seo and Mendelsohn, 2008). 
 First, climate has an effect on net money/money income in every country.

 Second, higher temperatures increase the net money/money income of watered farms. Third, higher temperatures are helpful to rainfed 
 farms in cooler weather but harmful to rainfed farms in warm 
 or hot weather. Fourth, more (rain, snow, etc.) is helpful unless 
 there is an too much/too many amount of rain. Fifth, seasonal hits/effects 
 change/differ  and are offsetting. 
 Our results, however, are not completely agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with previous money-based work on China's farming-based part/area (Liu et al., 
 2004). Our study finds that warming will be harmful to agriculture in China and that harm will grow over time, whereas 
 Liu et al. (2004) found it was helpful. We believe that this 
 difference may lie in the choice of data sets. The farm data set 
 in this study is likely more reliable than the county data set 
 used by Liu et al. (2004). 9 However, not all of the results of the 
 two studies were different. Both studies found that increased

 The importance of having described/explained household data for Ricardian analyses 
 rather than county-level data has already been recognized (e.g., Dinar et al., 
 2008). Since the Ricardian way of doing things completely/in a hinting way measures helpful change in farmers' decision, having a described/explained data set with clearly stated/particular helpful change options (in 
 the household data set) provides richer results and more meaningful policy 
 effects/results/suggestions. 
 
 rainfall was helpful. Both studies found that climate effects 
 are (not going in a straight line) and effects differ by season. Because of this, although the 
 temperature results are different, many of the other results of 
 the two studies are almost the same. 
 Our money-based analysis is also quite agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with (related to scientific farming) studies. Both analyses (describe the future) that worldwide  warming will 
 be harmful to China's farming. Both types of studies (describe the future) 
 that rainfed grains are especially (able to be hurt). However, the money-based analysis hints that the overall hits/effects will be smaller. 
 We believe that the crop study models lead to more negative-minded 
 results because they do not think about/believe helpful change. They do not 
 include the possibility of crop switching, changes in crop-watering/rinsing with water, 
 or other changes that farmers might begin/try. These helpful changes are completely/in a hinting way (taken/took by force)/(taken/took control of) in the Ricardian method. The 
 (related to scientific farming) studies also do not generally measure vegetables 
 and other high-valued crops grown in watered conditions, but 
 rather deal with grains. Therefore, they may underestimate the 
 benefits of warming to watered farms. 
 The not important effect of higher temperature for China is only 
 mildly harmful for two important reasons. Many areas in China 
 are cool so that a small warming causes little harm. Further, a

 large fraction of farms in China are watered and they at first 
 benefit from warming. At least at first, the farming-based part/area 
 as a whole in China is only mildly (able to be hurt). However, over 
 time, if warming strengthens, the damages to the rainfed part/area 
 will lead to growing losses. 
 An important message in the research is that crop-watering/rinsing with water is 
 very important to China's farm-related system. Nearly 60% of (helped to grow) 
 land in China is watered. This reliance on crop-watering/rinsing with water, however, 
 comes with a price. China's ability to deal with future climate 
 change depends on the availability of water for crop-watering/rinsing with water. Our 
 analysis assumes that water will continue to be available. Data 
 were not available to measure the amount of water each farmer 
 was using. It was therefore not possible to measure the importance of available water. This could be a critical problem 
 for China if climate warming makes water more and more rare/not enough. 
 The negative results of this study could become much larger if 
 warming forces many watered farms to become rainfed farms. 
 Clearly there is a strong need in China for further analysis of 
 the effects of climate change on water. 
 It is also quite seen/obvious that the effects of climate change 
 are not going to be uniform across the country. Warm- 
 
 ing will help areas that are now very highly productive and will further handicap areas that have below average 
 working well. Especially, warming will help the southeast 
 area but hurt the west and far north. China's policy makers need to be aware that warming is likely to force (on people) additional costs on particular areas that already have below average 
 incomes. 
 The fact that the (related to scientific farming) studies (describe the future) much larger damages than the Ricardian studies suggest that helpful change matters. 
 The ability of China's farmers to change and change to fit new 
 conditions has allowed China to outperform other farming-based 
 (processes of people making, selling, and buying things) in the world and will continue to be important with 
 respect to climate change. However, for farmers to be able to 
 last future climate changes, it is critical that policies allow 
 them to get the most out of the available factors of production and valuable things from nature. The results of this study suggest 
 that the direct effects of temperature and (rain, snow, etc.) on farms 
 may not be a great risk to China in the near future. However, the effect of climate change on water availability may 
 be very important. Given that water is already a very critical useful thing/valuable supply in certain areas of China, policy makers may

 want to use this useful thing/valuable supply intelligently, especially in areas where 
 water is rare/not enough. Climate change increases the pressure to develop institutions and (set of machines) in water-rare/not enough  areas to 
 treat water as a valuable useful thing/valuable supply. Because water (not enough of something) is 
 a (related to a large area) issue, it is very important that China put into use water 
 policies in each area that reflects the (related to a large area) lack of 
 water.
