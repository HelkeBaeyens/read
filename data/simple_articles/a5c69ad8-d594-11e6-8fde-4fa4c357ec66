 Abstract 
 Increasing competition for water across parts/areas increases the importance of the river (bowl/area drained by a river)  as the appropriate unit of 
 analysis to deal with the/to speak to the  challenges facing water supplies management; and modeling at this scale can provide very important 
 information for policymakers in their useful thing/valuable supply portion decisions. This paper introduces an (having different things working together as one unit) money-based-hydrologic 
 modeling (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) that account&#126; for the interactions between water portion, farmer input choice, farming-based working well, 
 non-farming-based water demand, and useful thing/valuable supply worsening in order to guess the social and money-based gains from improvement 
 in the portion and (wasting very little while working or producing something) of water use. The model is applied to the Maipo river (bowl/area drained by a river)  in Chile. Money-based benefits to 
 water use are tested for different demand management (tools or objects used to do work or measure something), including markets in tradable water rights, based 
 on production and benefit functions with respect to water for the farming-based and urban-industrial parts/areas. Â© 2000 Elsevier

 1. Introduction 
 With growing (not enough of something) and increasing competition 
 for water across parts/areas, the need for (producing a lot with very little waste), fair, and (able to last/helping the planet) water portion policies has increased in importance in water supplies management. 
 These policies can best be examined at the river (bowl/area drained by a river) 
 level, which links very important hydrologic, money-based, 
 (related to scientific farming), and institutional relationships as well as 
 water uses and users and their portion decisions. 
 To carry out this analysis, an (having different things working together as one unit) money-basedhydrologic modeling (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) at the (bowl/area drained by a river)  level 
 has been developed that accounts for the interactions

 between water portion, farmer input choice, farming-based working well, non-farming-based water demand, 
 and useful thing/valuable supply worsening in order to guess the 
 social and money-based gains from improvement in the 
 portion and (wasting very little while working or producing something) of water use. An application 
 to the Maipo river (bowl/area drained by a river)  in Chile is presented. The 
 following sections give an summary on the research 
 site, introduce the modeling (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built), and present 
 results of the model computer program. 
 
 2. The Maipo river (bowl/area drained by a river) 
 The Maipo river (bowl/area drained by a river), located in a key farming-based area in the city-based area of central Chile, 
 is a prime  example of a "mature water (process of people making, selling, and buying things)" 
 (see Randall, 1981) with growing water shortages

 and increasing competition for rare/not enough  water supplies 
 across parts/areas. The (bowl/area drained by a river)  is seen as a very 
 energetic farming-based part/area - serving an watered 
 area of about 127,000 ha (out of a total catchment area 
 of 15,380 km 2 ) - and a quickly growing industrial 
 and city-based  part/area - in particular in and surrounding the capital city of Santiago with a population of 
 more than 5 million people. More than 90% of the 
 watered area depends on water withdrawals from 
 surface flows. Once-a-year flows in the Maipo river average 4445 million m 3 . River ups and downs are mostly slow/cold in nature, with (large/relatively large) flows in 
 summer (November-February) and obvious 
 reductions in winter (April-June). 
 In the mid-1990s, total water withdrawals at the 
 off-take level in the Maipo river (bowl/area drained by a river)  were guessed 
 at 2144 million m3 . Farming accounted for 64% of 
 total withdrawals, domestic uses for 25%, and industry for the remaining 11%. The (bowl/area drained by a river)  includes eight 
 large crop-watering/rinsing with water districts with areas of 1300-45,000 ha. 
 Watered area in the (bowl/area drained by a river)  has been slowly declining due to more demands by the domestic and 
 industrial parts/areas for both water and land useful things/valuable supplies, 
 among other factors. By the mid-1970s, city-based  Santiago had already invaded more than 30,000 ha of 
 productive watered land (Court Moock et al., 1979). 
 However, the closeness to the capital city also provides 
 a money-making outlet for high-value crop production both 
 for the local market and for the energetic export part/area. 
 The largest city-based water company, EMOS, supplies about 85% of Santiago's population as well as 
 other city-based  areas. It owns about 17% of the amount/quantity of 
 flow in the upper Maipo river, plus the storage of the El 
 Yeso holding tank with a ability (to hold or do something) of about 256 million m 3 
 (Donoso, 1997). Supplies for industrial consumption 
 are drawn from the drinking-water distribution networks as well as from privately owned wells and, in 
 a few cases, from crop-watering/rinsing with water narrow waterways. All hydropower 
 stations in the (bowl/area drained by a river)  are of the run-of-the river type. 
 Competition among the different water users and 
 uses, especially, farming and domestic and industrial water uses, is increasing quickly. According 
 to Anton (1993), farming-based areas are mostly flood 
 inÂ·igated, and crop-watering/rinsing with water (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) range from 20 
 to 60% depending on local conditions. EMOS guesses an increase in domestic water demand of about 
 330 million m3 between 1997 and 2022, which it intends to meet mostly through better use of existing 
 
 water rights, the (instance of buying something for money) of added/more rights from crop-watering/rinsing with water districts, and added/more extraction of (underground water that supplies wells). However, in the past, EMOS has been unable 
 to buy (good) enough shares from crop-watering/rinsing with water districts, 
 and both industry and farming are competing for 
 (underground water that supplies wells) sources at levels going past the recharge 
 abilities (to hold or do something) of the underground waters in the city-based area 
 (Hearne, 1998; Bolelli, 1997). More than that, increasing 
 competition for rare/not enough  water supplies in the (bowl/area drained by a river) 
 has led to growing pollution problems that have yet to 
 be talked to/looked at by policy solutions (Anton, I 993). Although Chile has established the money-based instrument 
 of markets in tradable water rights following the Water 
 Law of 1981, which (helps increase/shows in a good way) the portion of water 
 to the uses with the highest values, room for improvement in the areas of water rights for (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) 
 and hydropower (non-sick) uses has become 
 obvious. These challenges in the Maipo (bowl/area drained by a river)  will be 
 talked to/looked at with the (having different things working together as one unit) money-based-hydrologic 
 modeling (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) introduced in the following. 
 
 3. The river (bowl/area drained by a river)  model 
 3.1. Modeling approach 
 The river (bowl/area drained by a river)  modeling system is developed as a 
 node-link network, in which nodes represent physical 
 things/businesses and links represent the connection between 
 these things/businesses (Fig. 1). The nodes included in the network are: (1) source nodes, such as rivers, holding tanks, 
 and (underground water that supplies wells) underground waters; and (2) demand nodes, 
 such as crop-watering/rinsing with water fields, industrial plants, and families. Each distribution node is a location where 
 water is (changed to flow or route differently) to different places/locations for helpful use. 
 The inflows to these nodes include water flows from 
 the (beginning point of a river) of the river (bowl/area drained by a river)  and rainfall drainage 
 entering the things/businesses. No prior storage is assumed for 
 the river nodes. Some farming-based and city-based and industrial (M&amp;I) demand places/locations or nodes 
 have been (related to space or existing in space)ly connected to the (bowl/area drained by a river)  network. 
 Farming-based demand places/locations are described/separated according 
 to the crop-watering/rinsing with water districts. At each farming-based demand site, water is set apart and given out to a series of crops, 
 according to their water needed things and money-based 
 a money-making state. Both crop area and produce are decided/figured out 
 endogenously in the model. Two demand places/locations have 
 been set apart and given out to the major city-based  area, Santiago.

 Fig. I. The Maipo river (bowl/area drained by a river)  network. 
 
 An existing hydrologic model, successfully applied 
 to the Amu Darya and Syr Darya river (bowls/areas drained by a river) in Central 
 Asia, has been changed to fit the Chilean big picture (McKinney and Cai, 1997). Also, a early model-related money-based 
 optimization model has been developed in order to guess money-based returns to water use. Although the 
 model has been developed as an optimization model, 
 (testing out) parts/pieces have been included to better 
 solve the complex optimization problem. Hydrologic 
 flow and salinity balance and tranport are (like the real thing) 
 endogenously within the optimization model and an 
 external crop-water (testing out) model is used to guess the crop yield function, with water, salinity and 
 crop-watering/rinsing with water technology as (numbers that change/things that change). 
 
 Both instream and off-stream water uses are carefully thought about/believed in the model. Instream uses include flows for 
 waste dilution and hydropower generation. Off-stream 
 uses include water diversion for farming and M&amp;I 
 water uses. The (putting a value on something) of instream and off-stream 
 uses is used in a brought together (as one) money-based goal 
 function, which is held back by hydrologic, (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth), and institutional relations. Water demand is 
 serious and stubborn endogenously within the model by using 
 scientific (related to scientific farming) production functions (yield against/compared to/or water, crop-watering/rinsing with water technology, salinity) and an M&amp;I 
 water demand function based on a market inverse demand function. Water supply is serious and stubborn through 
 the hydrologic water balance in the river (bowl/area drained by a river)  with 
 
 36 
 
 M. W Rosegrant et al. I Farming-based Money flow 24 (2000) 33-46 
 
 extension to the watered crop fields at each crop-watering/rinsing with water demand site. Water demand and water supply 
 are then (combined different things together so they worked as one unit) into an endogenous system and 
 balanced based on the money-based goal of making the most of benefits from water use, including crop-watering/rinsing with water, 
 hydropower, and M&amp;I benefits. Both water amount 
 and water quality in terms of salinity are (like the real thing) 
 in the model. The salt concentration in the return 
 flow from watered areas is clearly calculated in 
 the model. This allows the endogenous (serious thought/something to think about/respect) of this externality with respect to upstream and 
 downstream crop-watering/rinsing with water districts. The model includes 
 all the very important relationships of these parts/pieces in 
 a !-year time (line in the distance where the Earth and sky meet)  with a monthly time step. 
 
 3.2. Model parts/pieces 
 
 A curve-linear relationship is assumed between crop 
 produce and seasonally applied non-salty water. Crop 
 yield is (like the real thing) under given water computer program, crop-watering/rinsing with water technology (the Christiensen Evenness and equality Coefficient or CUC), and crop-watering/rinsing with water water salinity. Based on 
 these (testing out) results, a moving backward function of crop 
 yield with water computer program, crop-watering/rinsing with water evenness and equality, 
 and salinity was received/made from through the guess of the 
 limits/guidelines ao-a2 and bo-bs in Eq. (1). The function, 
 with particular limits/guidelines that have been guessed for 
 all crops in the model, is directly used in the optimization model to calculate crop yields with different 
 water computer program, salt concentration, and hint/signal. 
 The crop yield function is specified as follows: 
 Ya 
 
 = 
 
 Ymax[ao 
 
 + 
 
 G] 
 
 (wi/ Emax) 
 
 + a2ln(wi/ Emax)]_) 
 
 (1) 
 
 where 
 (related to the underlying messages or morals of a story), the modeling (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) includes 
 three parts/pieces: (1) hydrologic parts/pieces, including the water and salt balance in holding tanks, river 
 reaches and underground waters within the river (bowl/area drained by a river); (2) water 
 use parts/pieces, including water for crop-watering/rinsing with water and 
 M&amp;I water uses; and (3) money-based parts/pieces, including the calculation of benefits from crop-watering/rinsing with water, 
 hydropower, and M&amp;I demand places/locations. 
 Hydrologic relations and processes are based on the 
 flow network, which is an (thought about (or related to) ideas and possibilities) representation of 
 the (related to space or existing in space) relationships between the physical things/businesses 
 in the (bowl/area drained by a river). The major hydrologic relations/processes 
 include: flow transport and balance from river outlets/reservoirs to crop fields or M&amp;I demand places/locations; 
 salt transport and balance from river outlets/reservoirs 
 to watered crop fields; return flows from watered 
 and city-based  areas; interaction between surface and 
 (underground water that supplies wells); evapotranspiration in watered areas, 
 and hydropower generation as well as physical bounds 
 on storage, flows, diversions and salt concentrations. 
 The mathematical expressions for these relations, as 
 well as the calculation of deep percolation, return 
 flow from farming-based and M&amp;I demand places/locations, and 
 the interaction between surface and (underground water that supplies wells) can 
 be found in Rosegrant et al. (1999). It is assumed 
 that the water supply starts from rivers and holding tanks. 
 Effective rainfall is calculated outside of the model, 
 and included into the model as a constant limit/guideline. 
 The (related to scientific farming) relations involved in the (testing out) 
 model are changed/ready from Dinar and Letey (1996), (see 
 also Letey and Dinar, 1986, and Dinar et al., 1991). 
 
 = bo + b1u + b2c, 
 a2 = b6 + b7u + bsc 
 ao 
 
 a1 
 
 = b3 + b4u + bsc, 
 
 and where Ya is the crop yield (metric tons (mt)/ha), 
 Ymax the maximum (able to be done or reached) yield (mt/ha), ao, a 1, a2 
 are moving backward coefficients, bo-bs are moving backward coefficients, Wi is broken-into water (mm), Emax the maximum evapotranspiration (mm), c the salt concentration 
 in water application (dS/m), and u the Christiensen 
 Evenness and equality Coefficient (CUC). 
 Evenness and equality (CUC) is used as a substitute for both 
 crop-watering/rinsing with water technology and crop-watering/rinsing with water management activities. The CUC value differs/changes from about 50 
 for flood crop-watering/rinsing with water, to 70 for furrow crop-watering/rinsing with water, 80 for 
 sprinklers, and 90 for drip crop-watering/rinsing with water, and also differs/changes 
 with management activities. By including clear 
 representation of technology, the choice of water 
 application technology can be decided/figured out endogenously. The (money made/good thing received) from farming-based demand places/locations is 
 equal to crop money/money income minus fixed crop cost, crop-watering/rinsing with water technology improvement cost, and water supply 
 cost. The function for (money made/good things received) from crop-watering/rinsing with water (VA) at 
 demand site dm, is specified as follows: 
 VA(dm) 
 
 = LA(dm, cp)Ya(dm, cp)p(dm, cp) 
 cp 
 
 - LA(dm, cp) (fc(dm, cp) 
 
 + tc(dm, cp))

 (1996) -- higher hint/signal  values are related to

 costs), wp the water price (US$/m 3 ), w the water delivered to demand places/locations (m 3 ), ko the (stopping or interfering with something) of the 
 technology cost function, and k1 cost coefficient per 
 unit of u. 
 A typical crop yield function for wheat in the Maipo 
 river (bowl/area drained by a river)  is shown in Fig. 2. The function drives the 
 seasonal water portion among crops, but is not able 
 to distribute the (changed to flow or route differently) water among crop growth 
 stages according to the water demanded by each stage. 
 In order to (accomplish or gain with effort) (state of always working or appearing the same way) with the water balance 
 in the hydrologic system -- to fill the gap between the 
 farming and (water science) in the optimization model 
 - an scientific yield-evapotranspiration relationship 
 given by Doorenbos and Kassam (1979) has been used 
 to account for the stage effect. This relationship was 
 applied by including a penalty term into the goal 
 function, based on the maximum stage yield shortage 
 (see below for the (detailed description of exactly what is required) of the penalty term). 
 The penalty drives the water application according to 
 the water demands in crop growth stages. 
 
 = 70, Salinity = 0.7 dS/m). 
 
 The net benefit function for M&amp;I water use is taken from an inverse demand function for water. Net 
 benefit is calculated as water use benefit minus water 
 supply cost. 
 VM(w)=wopo/(1 
 
 +a) [Cw/wo)a +2a + 1]- wwp 
 (3) 
 
 where VM is the benefit from M&amp;I water use (US$_$), 
 wo the maximum water withdrawal (m 3 ), po the desire to pay for added/more water at full use (US$_$), 
 a is lie, e the price ability to stretch of demand (now 
 -0.45). 
 The function is based on (creation/combination) of partial secondary data and in its current form only applies 
 to surface water. The desire to pay for water 
 at full use is guessed at US$_$ 0.35 per m3 . The 
 per unit value of water for M&amp;I was guessed at 
 3.5 times the per unit value of water in farming, based on an repeating/repetitive search process on value 
 against/compared to/or water demand, so that water withdrawal to 
 crop-watering/rinsing with water and to M&amp;I in the base year model solution matches historical values. The small amount of 
 local (underground water that supplies wells) use (about 12% of once-a-year M&amp;l 
 withdrawals or 95 million m3 ) is treated as a fixed 
 amount. Fig. 3 shows the relationship between water

 Benefits from power generation are (compared to other things) small 
 in the Maipo (bowl/area drained by a river)  compared to off-stream water uses. 
 The (money made/good thing received) from power generation (VP) at a power 
 station, pwst, is calculated as 
 
 to (make as big as possible) money-based (money made/good thing received) from water supply for 
 crop-watering/rinsing with water, M&amp;l water use, and (related to generating electricity by damming rivers) power 
 generation, subject to institutional, physical, and other 
 restrictions. The unemotional function is specified as 
 follows:

 where power is the power production, for each power 
 station and period (kWh), which is a function of water flow for runoff stations, and of water release and 
 holding tank head for stations with dams, as well as hydropower creating ability (to hold or do something) and (wasting very little while working or producing something); pprice is 
 the price of power production for each power station 
 (US$/kWh); and pcost is the cost of power production, 
 for each power station (US$/kW h). 
 The model also includes a series of institutional 
 rules, including minimum needed/demanded water supply to a 
 demand site, minimum and maximum crop production, flow needed thing through a river reach for (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) and (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) purposes, and maximum

 defined in Doorenbos and Kassam ( 1979). 
 
 3.3. Model solution 
 The model has been coded in the modeling language 
 of the General Math-related Modeling System (GAMS) 
 (Brooke et a!., 1988), a high-level modeling system 
 for mathematical programming problems. Since the 
 model is highly non-linear and includes a large number of (numbers that change/things that change) and equations, it is solved in two steps. 
 In the first step, the salinity (number or thing that changes) is fixed. The solution of this model is used for the first values of 
 the (numbers that change/things that change) in the second model with changeable salt 
 concentration (see Cai, 1999). 
 
 4. Results and policy analysis 
 The focus of the modeling in this paper is on 
 the farm-related part/area and less so on the 
 non-farming-based water parts/areas. 
 
 4.1. Basin-improving solution ('baseline') 
 Ideas (you think are true) in the basin-improving solution include a water price in M&amp;I demand places/locations of US$_$ 
 0.1 per m 3 and in farming-based demand places/locations of US$_$ 
 0.04 per m 3 . Crop technology is fixed at CUC equal 
 
 39 
 
 to 70. More than that, it is assumed that 15% of the inflow is reserved for (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) (instream) uses. 
 The source salinity is 0.3 g/1. No water right is set up 
 and water withdrawals to demand places/locations depend on their 
 (pertaining to each person or thing) demands with the goal of making the most of 
 (bowl/area drained by a river)  benefits. 
 The model includes 15 crops, but the five main 
 crops relating to/connected to collected (watered) area are 
 once-a-year search, corn, grapes, peach and other (large group of fruit or nut trees) 
 trees, and wheat. Table I presents the production 
 for these crops figured out by/decided by the model for the crop-watering/rinsing with water demand places/locations in the (bowl/area drained by a river), compared with 
 the actual production data for 1994-1996. As can be 
 seen, the basin-improving solution guesses a higher 
 overall production, compared to the 1994-1996 values. More than that, the solution favors the crops with 
 higher (money made/good thing received) per unit of water supplied, such as peach 
 and grapes. Table 2 shows the (a measure of what occurs naturally/sports boundary line) collected 
 area came/coming from the model and a comparison with 
 the actual situation in the (bowl/area drained by a river)  in the mid-1990s. 
 The total collected area guessed by the model is 
 146,007 ha, compared to an area under production in 
 1994-1996 of 127, Ill ha. Again, crops that demand 
 large amounts of water and/or have lower money-based 
 values account for (compared to other things) less area in the model 
 result compared to the actual data. More than that, water withdrawals in the M&amp;I demand places/locations reach the 
 benefit-making the most of demand level at 1457 million m3 . 
 Under the (a measure of what occurs naturally/sports boundary line), total effective rainfall is guessed at 116 million m3 . Total water withdrawals are

 a Actual production is average for 1994-1996. As crop (many different kinds of people or things) in the (bowl/area drained by a river)  is very high, some crops are averages of group 
 production of almost the same  crops. Peach, for example, includes nut/very light brown, yellowish-orange fruit, cherry, nectarines, peach, and plum. Source of actual production

 guessed at 3817 million m 3 , 86% of the total inflows 
 of 4445 million m 3 . Water withdrawals are lowest in 
 the months of June and July, as only repeating crops 
 are present during this time. An seen/obvious excess 
 use of surface water - withdrawals go beyond source 
 flows - during the months of January-March and 
 November-December can be explained with the high 
 level of return flows that are being reused during these 
 months. Total return flows amount to 872 million m 3 
 or 20% of total inflows. Actual crop evapotranspiration is guessed at 954 million m3, 99.7% of the total 
 potential crop evapotranspiration of 956 million m 3 . 
 This value compares well with the data guessed in 
 Donoso (1997) of 972 million m 3 . According to the 
 model results, total farming-based water withdrawals 
 
 amount to 2360 million m 3 , which again is close to 
 the 2107 million m3 guessed in Donoso (1997). The 
 difference can be explained, in part, by the different 
 crop-watering/rinsing with water (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste). The overall (wasting very little while working or producing something) guessed 
 by local experts is about 45%, whereas the (wasting very little while working or producing something) 
 according to model results is 40.4%. 
 
 4.2. Sensitivity analysis 
 Four sensitivity analyses are presented in the following to test the strength of the model results: 
 changes in hydrologic levels, crop-watering/rinsing with water technology cost, crop price, and source salinity (Table 3). 
 According to the sensitivity analyses, M&amp;I water 
 withdrawals and benefits barely change with the

 changing range of technology cost, crop price, and 
 source salinity under conditions of (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) flow. This is 
 because, at (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) inflows, the M&amp;I demand places/locations can 
 withdraw up to their benefit-making the most of level within 
 the different range of those limits/guidelines. However, M&amp;I 
 withdrawals and benefits do change/differ  in the dry-year case 
 (see Table 4). 
 With a reduction of (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) inflows by half, water withdrawals and benefits for both farming-based and 
 M&amp;I demand places/locations decline sharply. Farming-based (money made/good things received) decrease by 37% and M&amp;I benefits decline by 9% 
 compared to (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) inflows. More than that, water withdrawals drop by 42% for crop-watering/rinsing with water and by 13% in 
 M&amp;I demand places/locations. So, in the case of drought, the 
 farm-related part/area is much more affected. Farming-based 
 water withdrawals are not sensitive to the cost of crop-watering/rinsing with water technology and (makes money/gets something good) from crop-watering/rinsing with water change/differ 
 only (a) little with changes in technology cost. (fair in amount, related to something else/properly sized compared to something else) changes over all crop prices in the range of 
 Â±25% have only small effects on crop-watering/rinsing with water water withdrawals. However, farmer incomes from crop-watering/rinsing with water are 
 significantly affected. With a reduction of crop prices 
 by 25%, crop-watering/rinsing with water water withdrawals decline by 5%, 
 whereas (money made/good things received) from crop-watering/rinsing with water drop by 60%. 
 A doubling of the source salinity leads to an increase in crop-watering/rinsing with water water withdrawals for salt leaking 
 by 5%. Increased salt leaking reduces (money made/good things received) from 
 crop-watering/rinsing with water by 14%. More than that, changes in the salinity 
 level influence crop patterns, with a decline in the collected area of crops with lower salt tolerance. With 
 doubled source salinity, the area planted to maize declines from 10 to 8% of total area planted whereas the 
 area planted with wheat - a more salt tolerant crop 
 - increases from 15 to 18%.

 incomes in the crop-watering/rinsing with water and M&amp;I parts/areas for a 
 drought-year case (50% of (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) inflows). With an 
 increase in the water price for crop-watering/rinsing with water from zero to 
 US$_$ 0.08 per m 3 , water withdrawals for farm-related 
 decline by 5%, from 1387 to 1326 million m3 . However, changes in the water price barely affect the crop 
 area. Watered area is maintained because farmers 
 move/change on the margin to more water (producing a lot with very little waste) crops and 
 reduce water use per hectare. Although both water 
 withdrawals and watered crop area barely change 
 with different water prices, farmer incomes can drop 
 extremely under this 'administrative price picture/situation': 
 by 42% from US$_$ 224 million to US$_$ 130 million 
 with increasing prices. M&amp;l benefits, on the other 
 hand, increase steadily with continuing water price 
 increases in farming, from US$_$ 550 million to US$_$ 
 570 million and M&amp;I water withdrawals increase by 
 3.6%. With water prices already quite high (higher 
 than what most farmers in the United States pay), 
 further price increases are a weapon for influencing water demand. Under these facts or conditions (that surround someone), 
 water markets that allow farmers to keep/hold the income 
 from sales of water may be better. 
 
 4.3. Money-based analysis of water trading 
 There are two basic plans for dealing 
 with water (not enough of something) in river (bowls/areas drained by a river), supply management and demand management; the former involves 
 activities to locate, develop, and fully use new sources 
 of water, and the last thing just mentioned addresses the (rewards or reasons for doing something) and 
 (machines/methods/ways) that (help increase/show in a good way) water (using less of something) and 
 (producing a lot with very little waste) use of water. 
 The first (or most important) other choice to amount-based portion 
 of water is (reward or reason for doing something)-based portion, either through 
 volumetric water prices or through markets in tradable 
 
 42 
 
 M. W Rosegrant et al. I Farming-based Money flow 24 (2000) 33-46 
 
 water rights. The evidence shows that farmers are price (able to reply or react/quick to respond) in their use of crop-watering/rinsing with water water 
 (Rosegrant et al., 1995; Gardner, 1983). The choice 
 between given prices and markets should be 
 mostly a function of which system has the lowest 
 (related to managing and running a company or organization) and transaction costs (TC). Markets in 
 tradable water rights can reduce information costs; increase farmer acceptance and participation; permit 
 water users; and provide security and (rewards or reasons for doing something) for 
 investment and for (making a part of you) the external costs of 
 water uses. Market portion can provide flexibility 
 in response to water demands, permitting the selling 
 and buying of water across parts/areas, across districts, and across time by opening opportunities for 
 exchange where they are needed. The results of the 
 exchange process reflect the water (not enough of something) condition 
 in the area with water flowing to the uses where its 
 not important value is highest (Rosegrant and Binswanger, 
 1994; Rosegrant, 1997). Markets also provide the 
 foundation for water leasing and option contracts, 
 which can quickly lessen acute, (for only a short time) city-based 
 water shortages while maintaining the farming-based 
 production base (Michelsen and Young, 1993). Establishment of markets in tradable property rights does 
 not suggest free markets in water. Rather, the system 
 would be one of managed trade, with institutions in 
 place to protect against third-party effects and potential negative (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) effects that are not 
 eliminated by the change in (rewards or reasons for doing something). Tradable water rights could lead to huge moves (from one place to another) of water to 
 city-based  and industrial centers. Therefore, farmers need 
 to be protected by (good) enough institutions and organizations. The Chilean Water Law of 1981 established the 
 basic (features/ qualities/ traits) of property rights over water as 
 a (fair in amount, related to something else/properly sized compared to something else) share over a changeable flow or amount. 
 Changes in the portion of water within and between parts/areas are (understood/made real/achieved) through markets in tradable 
 water rights (for details, see Gazmuri Schleyer and 
 Rosegrant, 1996; Hearne and Easter, 1995). 
 The (having different things working together as one unit) money-based-hydrologic river (bowl/area drained by a river) 
 model allows for a fairly realistic representation and 
 analysis of water markets. Water trading in the (bowl/area drained by a river) 
 is held back by the hydrologic balance in the river 
 (bowl/area drained by a river)  network; water is traded taking account of the 
 physical and technical restrictions of the different demand places/locations, reflecting their relative a money-making state in 
 trading prices; water trades reflect the relative seasonal water (not enough of something) in the (bowl/area drained by a river)  that is influenced 
 
 by both (bowl/area drained by a river)  inflows and the cropping pattern in 
 farming-based demand places/locations (whereas the M&amp;I water 
 demands are more stable); and negative externalities, 
 like increased salinity in downstream reaches due to 
 (in small steps up) crop-watering/rinsing with water water withdrawals upstream, 
 are endogenous to the model (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built). 
 
 4.3.1. Model creation for water trading 
 To extend the model to water trading analysis, in 
 a first step, a shadow price - water withdrawal relationship is serious and stubborn for each demand site. For 
 this, the model is run separately for each demand site 
 with different water withdrawals as inputs and shadow 
 prices or not important values as output came/coming from the 
 water balance equations (each crop-watering/rinsing with water demand site 
 includes a water balance equation for each of up to 15 
 crops). These shadow prices are then averaged over all 
 crops to get one shadow price for each water supply level for each demand site. Based on these input 
 and output values a moving backward function is guessed 
 for the shadow price- water withdrawal relationship 
 for each demand site. Fig. 4 shows the model results 
 and the moving backward relationship between shadow price 
 and water withdrawals for an farming-based demand site. 
 Water rights are set apart and given out (fair in amount, related to something else/properly sized compared to something else)ly to total inflows based on historical withdrawals for M&amp;I areas 
 and on the collected (watered) area for farming-based 
 demand places/locations. So, with reduced inflows, the (understood/made real/achieved) 
 books/large amounts of the water rights change without changes in 
 the rights structure. The water right refers to surface 
 water only. To decide/figure out the lower bound for (money made/good things received) 
 from water trade by demand site (it is assumed that 
 no demand site can lose from trading), the model is 
 solved for the case of water rights without trading. 
 Finally, the moving backward relationships of shadow price

 against/compared to/or water withdrawal for all farming-based and M&amp;I 
 demand places/locations, the water rights, and other water trading related restrictions (see Rosegrant et a!., 1999) are 
 added to the (bowl/area drained by a river)  model. It is assumed that the trading price for each demand site is equal to its shadow 
 price for water. This model is then solved to decide/figure out 
 the water trading price, wtp, and the amount/quantity of water 
 bought and sold by demand site. 
 Trade is allowed on a monthly basis and throughout the (bowl/area drained by a river)  and TC are got/caused by both buyer and 
 seller (US$_$ 0.04 per m 3 ). Up to 4 months of the (understood/made real/achieved) monthly water right can be traded as the monthly

 decision-maker improving benefits for the whole 
 (bowl/area drained by a river) (BO); water rights with no trading permitted 
 (WR), and water rights with trading (WRT). The 
 salinity (number or thing that changes) is fixed for all three water trading 
 pictures/situations. The results compare two cases for each of 
 these three pictures/situations: hydrologic level at 100% of 
 the (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) inflow and at 60% of the (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) inflow 
 (Table 5). Also, three TC pictures/situations are carefully studied 
 based on (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) inflow (Table 6). The description of 
 results will (focus mental and physical effort) on the drought-year picture/situation 
 (case B, 60% of (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) inflow), as the benefits change/differ 
 more clearly by money-based tool employed. 
 In the case of a drought year, total water withdrawals 
 are highest for the (bowl/area drained by a river)  improving case (BO), as each 
 and every demand site can withdraw according to its 
 monthly needs subject to an best result for the 
 (bowl/area drained by a river)  as a whole. These needs are this way only confined 
 by physical limits/guidelines, such as relative location in

 the (bowl/area drained by a river)  and institutional needed things. Water withdrawals decline (in a big way) in the WR case, relative 
 to BO, when withdrawals are limited to the (pertaining to each person or thing) 
 water right and trading is not allowed. Farming-based 
 withdrawals are often actually below the actual water 
 right, because dry-season flows are not enough to satisfy all crop water needed things. Another reason is that, 
 in about half of the months, only repeating crops are 
 grown, and so withdrawals are far below the given out/set aside 
 flow. 
 When water can be traded, crop-watering/rinsing with water withdrawals 
 actually (lower in number/get worse) further, although not very much. Crop-watering/rinsing with water withdrawals decline because the crop-watering/rinsing with water 
 districts sell part of their water right to the M&amp;I demand places/locations, by that/in that way collecting big (money made/good things received). In the 
 dry-year case, a total water volume of 296 million m 3 
 is traded, about 11% of total dry-year inflows. In the 
 case of (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) inflows, 264 million m3 of water is 
 traded, about 6% of total inflow. M&amp;I areas are the 
 main buyers in both cases, buying almost all the 
 water offered by the crop-watering/rinsing with water districts. All crop-watering/rinsing with water 
 districts are net sellers of water over the course of 
 the year. Under the drought-year case, only district 
 AS (instances of buying things for money) 0.2 million m 3 of water to maintain its 
 cropping pattern that features the largest share of 
 higher-valued, repeating crops (grapes, peach, among 
 others, see Table 2). In the case of (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) inflows, on 
 the other hand, the not important value of water is much 
 lower, and two farming-based demand places/locations, A6 and AS, 
 purchase water (0.2 million m 3 and 1O.S million m 3 , 
 (match up each pair of items in order)) to add to their crop production in 
 some months; however, overall both districts are net 
 sellers of water. 
 As the WR system does not allow the move (from one place to another) of 
 water to more helpful uses, benefits from water 
 uses are reduced (a lot) by locking the useful thing/valuable supply 
 into (compared to other things) low valued uses during shortages. As 
 
 a result, total net benefits are less than one-half of 
 the improving solution (US$_$ 3S9 million compared 
 with US$_$ S74 million). By permitting trading, water moves from less productive farming-based uses into 
 higher-valued city-based  water uses while at the same 
 time benefiting farm incomes. Total benefits in the 
 M&amp;I demand places/locations almost triple, compared to the WR 
 case, but gains are also significant for the crop-watering/rinsing with water 
 districts and each district can increase net (money made/good things received), by 
 between 6 and 62%, depending on their (pertaining to each person or thing) 
 physical and other (features/ qualities/ traits). Total net (money made/good things received) of 
 the part/area increase by about 20%, from US$_$ 253 million to US$_$ 301 million. In crop-watering/rinsing with water districts Al-AS 
 and A7, total net (money made/good things received) under the WRT picture/situation are 
 even higher than for the basin-improving case. This 
 is due to the higher value of the more rare water and 
 the resulting benefits from trade and does not happen 
 in case A with (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) inflow levels. 
 More than that, net (money made/good things received) from crop production decline 
 only (a) little with trading: from US$_$ 253 million to 
 US$_$ 244 million. Total crop production also barely 
 declines, from l.S66 million mt to 1.729 million mt. 
 Also, the proportion of higher-value repeating crops increases a lot from the WR to 
 the WRT pictures/situations, from 14 to 19% for grapes and 
 from 13 to 16% for peach, for example. These results 
 not only show the advantages of the water market 
 approach compared to the WR case, but also to the 
 (related to managing and running a company or organization) price picture/situation presented in the sensitivity analysis, in which water is also (gave/given out things in a different way) from 
 farming-based to non-farming-based uses, but at a punishment-based 
 cost to farming-based incomes. 
 In the move/change from fixed (fair in amount, related to something else/properly sized compared to something else) water rights to 
 trade, total benefits to the (bowl/area drained by a river)  increase from 45% of 
 the all-knowing decision-maker (BO picture/situation) to SO%. 
 However, total benefits under water trading are actually even closer to the total/totally/with nothing else mixed in best than shown here, 
 
 M. W Rosegrant et a/. I Farming-based Money flow 24 (2000) 33-46 
 
 because no watching/transaction costs are charged 
 for the all-knowing decision-maker when in fact the 
 cost would likely be very high. 
 For the water trading picture/situation, it is now assumed that both buyer and seller add/give equally to 
 TC (US$_$ 0.04perm3 ). Three TC pictures/situations were run 
 in addition to this base trading picture/situation: zero TC, US$_$ 
 0.1 per m3 , and US$_$ 0.2 per m3 . The results are shown 
 in Table 6. As can be expected, water withdrawals 
 decline with increasing TC, and the amount/quantity of water 
 traded steep drops by more than half, from 278 million m3 
 for the case without TC to 138 million m3 for the 
 case with TC of US$_$ 0.2 per m3 . This is due, in part, 
 to the fact that the TC are quite high relative to the 
 shadow prices for water, which range from US$_$ 0.18 
 to 1.27 per m3 . Total net benefits decline (in a big way), 
 from US$_$ 871 million at zero TC to US$_$ 755 million 
 at TC of US$_$ 0.2 per m3 ; gains from trade also drop 
 sharply, from US$_$ 122 million to only US$_$ 6 million, 
 (match up each pair of items in order). So, making trading (producing more with less waste) (reducing TC) has significant benefits, increasing both 
 the volume and the benefits from trade.

 Although these early/incomplete results show the effectiveness of the model for policy analysis and water 
 portion in the river (bowl/area drained by a river), added/more research is 
 needed. During a second research phase, the farming-based production functions will be extended to include 
 inputs in addition to land, water, and crop-watering/rinsing with water technology, such as farming-based chemicals and labor. In 
 addition, the city-based  water demand functions will be 
 re-guessed based on scientific data and disaggregated into household and industrial water demands. 
 More than that, the power generation will be adjusted 
 to local limits/guidelines. Based on this extension, more 
 complete policy analysis will be carried out. 
 Existing institutions (related to/looking at/thinking about) water rights, priority 
 portions, and added/more institutional realities will 
 be better represented based on local data. Finally, direct cooperation will be established with the (connected/related) 
 government people in charge and water user associations in 
 the (bowl/area drained by a river), with the goal of (putting into a hospital)/(making a behavior acceptable) the model 
 as a decision support system for (bowl/area drained by a river)  water policy.

 5. Ends/end results 
 This paper presents a early model-related river (bowl/area drained by a river)  model 
 that includes very important hydrologic, (related to scientific farming) and 
 money-based relationships, and reflects the relationships of water and salinity, food production, 
 money-based welfare, and (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) results. 
 The model is applied to the Maipo river (bowl/area drained by a river)  in 
 Chile, but due to its not brand-name form and structure can 
 be applied to other (bowls/areas drained by a river). 
 The model results show the benefits of water rights 
 trading with water moving into higher valued farming-based (and M&amp;l) uses. Net (money made/good things received) in watered farm-related increase a lot compared to the case of 
 (fair in amount, related to something else/properly sized compared to something else) use rights for demand places/locations. More than that, 
 farming-based production does not (lower in number/get worse) significantly. 
 Net benefits for crop-watering/rinsing with water districts can be even higher 
 than for the basin-improving case, as farmers collect 
 big benefits from selling their unused water 
 rights to M&amp;l areas during the months with little or 
 no crop production. Finally, making trading (producing more with less waste), that is, reducing transaction costs, has significant benefits, increasing both the amount of trading 
 and the benefits from trade.
