 ABSTRACT 
 New technologies must be developed in sub-Saharan Africa which are (able to last/helping the planet) and 
 (money-based)/cheaply doable/possible. This paper discusses a way(s) of doing things for measuring the farming-based 
 (the ability to keep something around, or keep something going) and money-based ability to be done of (related to areas near the Equator/hot and humid) farming systems for new technology test. The approach is based on the idea  of interspatial and intertemporal total factor 
 working well, paying particular attention to (putting a value on something) of valuable thing from nature stock and flows. 
 Farming is a part/area which uses valuable things from nature (e.g. soil (vitamins, minerals, protein, etc.)) and the stock and 
 flows of these useful things/valuable supplies affect the production (surrounding conditions). However, in many cases, the 
 stock of these useful things/valuable supplies is beyond the control of the farmer and must be accounted for in an 
 farming-based (the ability to keep something around, or keep something going) and money-based ability to be done measurement. For example, soil (vitamins, minerals, protein, etc.) 
 are removed by crops, wearing away or leaking beyond the crop root-zone, or other processes 
 such as volatilization of nitrogen. Farming-based production can also add/give to the stock of 
 some (vitamins, minerals, protein, etc.) by (containing peas, beans, lentils, etc.) plants such as agroforestry systems. Using a data set available 
 at the International Institute of (related to areas near the Equator/hot and humid) Farming, we figure out/calculate  the intertemporal and 
 interspatial total factor working well indices for four cropping systems in southwestern 
 Nigeria using stock of major soil (vitamins, minerals, protein, etc.) as the valuable thing from nature stock. Results show that 
 the (the ability to keep something around, or keep something going) and money-based ability to be done measures are sensitive to changes in the stock and 
 flow of soil (vitamins, minerals, protein, etc.) as well as the material inputs and outputs. Where the (thing that's given/work that's done) of 
 valuable thing from nature stock and flows are important (such as in the case of alley cropping), the

 measures provide very (much) different results from ordinary TFP approaches. The 
 advantage of this approach is that interspatial and intertemporal total factor working well 
 measures are figured out/calculated using only price and amount data, this way eliminating the need for 
 econometric guess. 
 
 1. INTRODUCTION 
 
 Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is the only area of the world where percapita food production has steadily (lowered in number/got worse/gotten worse) over the past twenty years 
 (IBRD, 1989). Although bad/unhelpful farm policy (e.g. inappropriate money-related 
 and pricing policies, not enough extension and marketing services) may be 
 responsible in part for the low farming-based output, the ability of the 
 valuable thing from nature base (especially soils) to sustain continued production 
 under current farming practices is being questioned (Lal, 1987). The 
 most important farming systems in SSA are based on shifting (producing crops/helping something grow) 
 practices. Farmers fell and burn the unplanted green plants, help grow the cleared 
 land (usually 1 to 3 years) and then (leave behind and alone) the site (from 4 to 20 years) 
 to forest or bush cover (Sanchez, 1976). This traditional farming-based production system, which is known to be stable and (related to living things) (producing a lot with very little waste), 
 operates effectively only when there is (good) enough land to allow a long unplanted 
 period to restore soil working well (Kang et al, 1989). 
 Today, however, due to fast (related to information about people) and money-based changes, 
 helped grow area has said more aboutto not important soil types and unplanted periods 
 are being reduced, resulting in planned worsening of major areas of 
 land in SSA and (lowering in number/getting worse) yields (Matlon and Spencer, 1984; Kang et al, 
 1989; Ehui and Hertel, 1992). This is increased by the fact that most 
 soils of humid (related to areas near the Equator/hot and humid) Africa are sandy, highly weathered, low in organic 
 matter content and (able to be harmed by) soil wearing away and compaction (Lal, 1987; 
 El-Ashry and Ram, 1987). So, the challenge faced by decision makers in 
 many nations in SSA is how to feed an increasing population without 
 permanently damaging the valuable thing from nature base on which farming-based 
 production depends (Ehui and Hertel, 1989; Ehui et al, 1990). 
 Clearly, new technologies must be developed which not only improve 
 food production but also maintain (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) (firm and steady nature/lasting nature/strength) and preserve the 
 valuable thing from nature base, (in other words) technologies, which are both (money-based)/cheaply doable/possible 
 and (able to last/helping the planet) (BIFAD, 1988). For that reason, the Technical (communication about what could or should be done) 
 Committee (TAC) of the Advice-giving Group on International Farming-based 
 Research (CGIAR) has recommended that research at international centers which is designed to create farming-based inventions of new things should be 
 planned and managed and did/done with a (the ability to keep something around, or keep something going) (way of seeing things / sensible view of what is and is not important) (CGIAR, 1989a,b). 
 However, practical and countable methods for measuring the sustainabil- 
 
 SUSTAINABILITY AND ECONOMIC VIABILITY OF TROPICAL FARMING SYSTEMS 
 
 281 
 
 ity and money-based ability to be done of farming-based systems need to be developed 
 (CGIAR, 1991). 
 Dumanski (1987) critically examines the idea  of (the ability to keep something around, or keep something going) as 
 applied to farming-based systems. He ends/decides that although measurements 
 can focus on soil qualities and on (money-related) ability to be done, current ideas are 
 too broad to be practical, and (the ability to keep something around, or keep something going) is hard to measure using 
 them. Based on the idea  of safe minimum standard of Ciriacy-Wantrup 
 (1968), Pearce et al. (1990) and Barbier et al. (1990) argue that to make the 
 idea  of farming-based (the ability to keep something around, or keep something going) operational at the project evaluation 
 level, is to assume that it is dependent on the faithfulness or non-negative 
 rate of change of the natural capital stock. They recommend that within an 
 farming-based development program, projects should be accepted not on the 
 basis of their net present value (money-based (wasting very little while working or producing something)) but on whether their 
 streams of (surrounding conditions) benefits make up for any (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) damage (forced (on people)/caused an inconvenient situation) by other projects. However, their proposed way(s) of doing things 
 needs/demands defining the other choice (making up for something/paying for something) projects as well as measuring the connected (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) effects. Lynam and Herdt (1989) suggested a (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) by which the (the ability to keep something around, or keep something going) idea  could be scientifically included into the research process. They developed some 
 suggestions (or plans), one of which states that "the appropriate measure of output 
 by which to decide/figure out (the ability to keep something around, or keep something going) at the crop, cropping or farming 
 system level is total factor working well, defined as the total value of all 
 output produced by the system over one cycle divided by the total value of 
 all inputs used by the system over one cycle of the system; a (able to last/helping the planet) 
 system has a non-negative (popular thing/general way things are going) in total factor working well over the period 
 of concern." 
 Building upon the above suggestion/possible plan, this paper uses recent advances in 
 working well measurement and money-based index numbers to develop a model 
 for measuring money-based ability to be done and farming-based (the ability to keep something around, or keep something going). The method 
 used is based on Denny and Fuss' (1983) interspatial and intertemporal 
 total factor working well measures, changed to change something (to help someone)/take care of someone changes in 
 useful thing/valuable supply stocks and flows. Farming is a part/area which uses natural 
 useful things/valuable supplies (e.g. soil (vitamins, minerals, protein, etc.)) and changes in the stock and flows of these 
 useful things/valuable supplies need to be accounted for in (the ability to keep something around, or keep something going) measures. 
 The paper is organized into six sections. Section 2 provides an summary 
 of the definition of (the ability to keep something around, or keep something going) and money-based ability to be done. Two suggestions (or plans) 
 related to the measurement of these two ideas are stated. Section 3 
 presents the idea-based (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built). It introduces a generalized model for 
 measurement of total factor working well (TFP). Section 4 develops ideas of intertemporal and interspatial TFP which are used as measures of 
 money-based ability to be done and farming-based (the ability to keep something around, or keep something going), (match up each pair of items in order). In Section 5 
 
 282

 an scientific example is carefully thought about/believed. Section 6 provides a summary and 
 some ending/deciding qualifications and comments. 
 2. DEFINITIONS OF SUSTAINABILITY AND ECONOMIC VIABILITY 
 
 Different definitions have been proposed for (the ability to keep something around, or keep something going). TAC for 
 example, defines a (able to last/helping the planet) farming-based system as one in which there is 
 "the successful management of useful things/valuable supplies for farming to make happy the 
 changing human needs while maintaining or improving the quality of the 
 (surrounding conditions) and conserving valuable things from nature" (CGIAR, 1989b). Along 
 the same lines, a Group of the American (community of people/all good people in the world) of Farming provides the following definition: "A (able to last/helping the planet) farming is one that, over 
 the long term, improves (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) quality and the useful thing/valuable supply base on 
 which farming depends; provides for basic human food and fiber needs; 
 is (money-based)/cheaply doable/possible and improves the quality of life for farmers and 
 all people" (Unnamed, 1989). 
 A third definition which is given by Conway (1985) says: "(the ability to keep something around, or keep something going) is the ability of a system to maintain working well in spite of a major 
 disturbance, such as caused by intensive stress or a large (disturbing or causing a small change in something)." 
 Building upon Conway's definition, Lynam and Herdt (1989) define (the ability to keep something around, or keep something going) as "the ability (to hold or do something) of a system to maintain output at a level 
 about equal to or greater than its historical average, with the 
 guess figured out by/decided by its historical level of (quality of changing over time or at different places)", (in other words) a 
 (able to last/helping the planet) system is "one with a non-negative (popular thing/general way things are going) in measured output 
 and technology adds/gives to (the ability to keep something around, or keep something going) if it increases the slope of the 
 trend line." Finally, Young (1989, p. 10) defines a (able to last/helping the planet) land use 
 system as that "which (accomplishes or gains) production combined with (using less of something) of 
 the useful things/valuable supplies on which that production depends, by that/in that way permitting the 
 maintenance of working well." 
 It is with these last two definitions in mind that a measure of (the ability to keep something around, or keep something going) is proposed. The approach is based on the intertemporal total factor 
 working well (TFP) measure using the growth accounting (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) as 
 developed by Denny and Fuss (1983). Intertemporal TFP is defined in 
 terms of the productive ability (to hold or do something) of the system over time. However, this 
 productive ability (to hold or do something) for a (able to last/helping the planet) system includes the unpriced (things that are given/work that's done) from valuable things from nature and their unpriced production flows. Given 
 that (the ability to keep something around, or keep something going) is something commonly seen in a system's productive performance 
 over time, it appears that intertemporal TFP is the right/the proper measure of 
 (the ability to keep something around, or keep something going) as it faces/deals with the question of intertemporal change in 
 working well of a system between two or more periods. Therefore, a system 
 will be said to be (able to last/helping the planet) if the connected intertemporal TFP index, which 
 
 SUSTAINABILITY AND ECONOMIC VIABILITY OF TROPICAL FARMING SYSTEMS 
 
 283 
 
 incorporates and values changes in the useful thing/valuable supply stock and flow, does not 
 decrease (Suggestion/possible plan 1). 
 Unlike (the ability to keep something around, or keep something going), money-based ability to be done is a static idea  which refers 
 to the (wasting very little while working or producing something) with which useful things/valuable supplies are employed in the production 
 process at a given period. A new production system can be said to be more 
 (money-based)/cheaply doable/possible (or (producing a lot with very little waste)) than an existing one if its total factor 
 working well is greater at a given point in time. By higher TFP, we mean the 
 ability (to hold or do something) of the new system to produce more output than the existing one 
 after accounting for differences in amounts of inputs and unpriced 
 valuable things from nature used in each system during one crop season. On the dual 
 side it is understood/explained as the ability (to hold or do something) of the new production system to 
 produce outputs with lower total costs than the existing one, after accounting for differences in output levels, input prices and unpriced natural 
 useful things/valuable supplies and any other state of nature or (coming from the outside of something) (numbers that change/things that change). 
 So, to compare the money-based ability to be done of production systems, we 
 fight (for something) the idea  of interspatial TFP which is defined in terms of the 
 productive ability (to hold or do something) of one system over another, at a given period (e.g. a 
 cropping season) including the unpriced (thing that's given/work that's done) from valuable things from nature to production. A system will be said to be (money-based)/cheaply more doable/possible 
 than another one if the interspatial TFP index connected with the former 
 which incorporates and values (related to space or existing in space) differences in the useful thing/valuable supply stock and 
 flow, is higher than the interspatial TFP index connected with the last thing just mentioned 
 (Suggestion/possible plan 2). 
 We restrict this analysis to the cropping of farming system level because 
 technologies that are created in farming systems research in SSA are 
 applied at this level and are mainly for small scale farmers who produce 
 most of Africa's food and whose farming systems have low and declining 
 working well (UTA, 1989). Also as noted by Lynam and Herdt (1989), above 
 the farming system level, so many external factors affect the (the ability to keep something around, or keep something going) 
 of farming systems that it is practically impossible to decide/figure out the source 
 of such hits/effects. 
 3. A GENERALIZED MODEL FOR MEASUREMENT OF TFP 
 
 The ordinary approach to growth-accounting uses TFP indexes to 
 measure the leftover/extra growth in outputs not here by the growth in 
 factor inputs. The rate of growth of TFP is ordinarily defined as the 
 rate of growth of group output minus the rate of growth of group 
 inputs (Capalbo and Antle, 1989). However, the farming-based part/area uses 
 common pool valuable things from nature (e.g. air, water, soil (vitamins, minerals, protein, etc.), etc.). The 
 stock of these useful things/valuable supplies affects the production (surrounding conditions), but is, in many 
 
 284 
 
 S.K. EHUI AND D.S.C. SPENCER 
 
 cases, beyond the control of the farmer. For example, soil (vitamins, minerals, protein, etc.) are 
 removed by crops, wearing away or leaking beyond the crop root zone, or 
 through other processes such as volatilization of nitrogen. Farming-based 
 production can also add/give to the stock of some of the (vitamins, minerals, protein, etc.), 
 especially of nitrogen, by (containing peas, beans, lentils, etc.) plants. When the stock of useful things/valuable supplies 
 is reduced, the farmer faces an understood cost in terms of forgone working well. (in the opposite way), when the stock of useful things/valuable supplies is increased during the production process (e.g. via nitrogen constant thought), the farmer gets an understood 
 benefit from the system. 
 If these understood costs and benefits are not here when TFP is 
 measured, results will be (created unfair thinking in)/(unfair-thinking). Squires (1991) shows that when common 
 pool useful thing/valuable supply stocks are used, it is inappropriate for working well measurement to treat the useful thing/valuable supply stock as a ordinary input. Rather, the 
 useful thing/valuable supply stock is more appropriately specified as a (related to computers and science) restriction. 
 This is because for a given input bundle, increases (decreases) in useful thing/valuable supply 
 (oversupply/large quantity) shift the production function, increasing (decreasing) useful thing/valuable supply 
 flows and output. Our generalized model for TFP measurement differs 
 from that of Squires (1991) in that the (thing that's given/work that's done) of crop outputs and 
 useful thing/valuable supply flows (both addition and (everything is gone)) are separately accounted for. 
 Assuming that current prices are known, the (biggest increase/best possible extent) problem 
 when changes in useful thing/valuable supply stock levels are positive is stated as: 
 
 (1) 
 where 71"1 is a measure of group (money made/good thing received) in period t, including all benefits 
 and costs of useful thing/valuable supply abuse, and B 1 is a technology shift (number or thing that changes) 
 representing the level of useful thing/valuable supply (oversupply/large quantity) in period t. Equation (1) 
 represents the case of 'open access' in which B 1 is not a choice (number or thing that changes). 
 The useful thing/valuable supply stock is beyond the control of farmers who this way ignore its 
 opportunity cost. Z 1 is an externality representing the net useful thing/valuable supply flow (i.e. 
 Bt+l- B 1 ) in period t. When changes in useful thing/valuable supply (oversupply/large quantity) levels are 
 positive, we have a positive externality and the resulting net useful thing/valuable supply flow, 
 Z 1 is treated as an output, this way adding/giving positively to the group 
 profit; Yr is an index of crop outputs; Pyt and Pzt are the product and 
 useful thing/valuable supply flow prices; G( Â·) is the changeable cost function for the best 
 combination of changeable inputs, where aG( Â·);as &amp;lt; 0 and aG( Â·);az &amp;gt; 0; 
 and w; is a vector of changeable input prices; t is the time (popular thing/general way things are going) representing 
 the state of technical knowledge. 
 When the production process is using up/reducing the useful thing/valuable supply at a rate faster 
 than that needed/demanded for (the ability to keep something around, or keep something going), net changes in useful thing/valuable supply (oversupply/large quantity) 
 levels are negative (i.e. Bt+l -B1 = -Z1 ). So, we have a negative externality and Z 1 is treated as a cost, adding/giving negatively to the group 
 
 SUSTAINABILITY AND ECONOMIC VIABILITY OF TROPICAL FARMING SYSTEMS 
 
 285 
 
 (money made/good thing received). This needs/demands change of the unemotional function (1) by replacing 
 the ( +) sign before Pz 1 Z 1 with a (-)sign, and in this case, aG( Â·);az &amp;lt; 0. 
 Using the first order conditions of (1), development of the continuous 
 time Divisia index by method of the growth accounting approach (see the 
 Add on) gives: 
 
 -a Ln c;at= [PyY/C]Y+ [PzZ)!C]i- L:[(UJXj);c]xj-B 
 
 (2) 
 
 j 
 
 where C = Lj U]Xj = PYY + PzZ is the total money/money income, assuming constant 
 returns to scale. Dots on (numbers that change/things that change) suggest the logarithm derivation of the 
 connected (number or thing that changes) with time. When changes in the useful thing/valuable supply stock are 
 negative, the working well index becomes: 
 
 -a Ln c;at= [Py/C]Y- [_((PzZ)/C]i- L:[(UJXjC)]xj-B 
 
 (3) 
 
 j 
 
 where C = L:j U]Xj + PzZ = PYY, assuming constant returns to scale. 
 Equations (2) and (3) point to/show that TFP is measured as the leftover/extra after 
 the growth rate of output has been set apart and given out among changes in inputs and 
 useful thing/valuable supply (oversupply/large quantity) and flows. The basic difference between (2) and (3) is 
 that in the former case the change in useful thing/valuable supply stock is assumed positive 
 and the resulting flow is treated as a benefit. In the last thing just mentioned case, the change 
 in useful thing/valuable supply stock is assumed to be negative and the resulting flow is treated 
 as a cost. 
 It is clear from (2) and (3) that working well measures are (created unfair thinking in)/(unfair-thinking) unless 
 differences/different versions in the useful thing/valuable supply stock (oversupply/large quantity) levels and useful thing/valuable supply flows are 
 accounted for. Note that although it is not a choice (number or thing that changes), B 1 is part of 
 the solution because it appears in the changeable cost function, G. 
 4. INTERTEMPORAL AND INTERSPATIAL TFP MEASURES 
 
 Having specified a generalized model of TFP, we now go ahead to 
 develop intertemporal and interspatial TFP measures. Assume that the 
 farming-based production process of cropping system i in period t can be 
 represented by the dual changeable cost function: 
 
 (4) 
 where Git is the cost of production, w; 1 is a vector of input prices; Â¥; 1 is 
 crop output; Zit is the change in useful thing/valuable supply stock levels; Bit is the useful thing/valuable supply 
 stock (oversupply/large quantity) level; and &#126; and Di represent the intertemporal and 
 interspatial (wasting very little while working or producing something) difference indicators. Derivation of the intertemporal 
 and interspatial TFP indices depends critically on the proper (detailed description of exactly what is required) 
 
 286 
 
 S.K. EHUI AND D.S.C. SPENCER 
 
 of the total cost function cil' which in turn depends on the nature of zil' 
 (in other words) whether the change in useful thing/valuable supply stock is positive or negative. We 
 therefore think about/believe two cases: 
 Case 1: Net positive change in useful thing/valuable supply stock. Assuming constant returns to 
 scale and competitive factor markets, application of Diewert's (1976) 
 quadratic lemma to a logarithmic guess of (4) gives: 
 
 Ll Ln C = 
 
 HRyis + Ryot][Ln Yis- Ln Yot] + H Rzis + Rzot] 
 X 
 
 t L [skis+ skot] [Ln wkis- Ln wkot] 
 
 [Ln zis- Ln zot] + 
 
 k 
 
 - [Ln Bis- Ln Bot] + E)io + f.Lst 
 (5) 
 where i and o represent two clear/separate farming (or land use) systems, and s 
 and t represent two clear/separate time periods. skis and skot are the kth input 
 factor cost shares; R yis and R yot are the money/money income shares for product Y; and 
 Rzis and Rzot are (understood) money/money income shares for useful thing/valuable supply flow Z. E&amp;gt;io and f.Lst 
 represent the interspatial and intertemporal effect and are defined as: 
 1 [_( a Ln G I 
 aD D&#126;Di + 
 
 E&amp;gt;io = 
 
 2 
 
 f.Lst =

 T&#126;T, [&#126;- Tt] 
 
 (7)

 Equation (5) states that the cost difference across cropping systems and 
 time periods can be broken into six terms including: (1) an output effect, 
 (2) a useful thing/valuable supply flow effect, (3) an input price effect, (4) a useful thing/valuable supply stock 
 effect, (5) an interspatial effect, and (6) an intertemporal effect. 
 Following Denny and Fuss (1983), to measure the intertemporal TFP 
 (this way (the ability to keep something around, or keep something going)) of a particular technology, we set Di = D0 = 0. Solving 
 for f.Lts in (5) yields the dual measure of intertemporal working well for two 
 periods s and t: 
 
 HRys + Ryt][Ln &#126;- Ln &#126;] - H Rzs + Rzt] 
 X [Ln zs- Ln Zt]- t L [Sks + skt] [Ln wks- Ln wks] 
 
 f.Lts = [Ln Gs- Ln Gt] - 
 
 k 
 
 (8) 
 (in almost the same way), the dual measure of interspatial working well between system 
 and reference System o at a particular point in time (Ts = Tt = 0) is: 
 f)io = [Ln Gi- Ln G 0 ]_)

 Now turn to the emotional  space. Totally (making different) the log of the cost 
 equations G = L; W;X;, with respect to time yields: 
 (10) 
 
 The Tornqvist guess to (10) for periods sand t and systems i and o 
 gives:

 (11) 
 Equating (5) and (11) and solving for (- 1-Lst) and (- E&amp;gt;io) gives measures of 
 intertemporal and interspatial working well in the emotional  space.

 Note that under our ideas (you think are true) equations (12) and (13) are equal to the 
 negative of the intertemporal and interspatial working well measures that 
 are received/got in the dual space (Ohta, 1974). 
 
 Case 2: Net negative change in useful thing/valuable supply stock. Following the same procedure as in case 1, intertemporal and interspatial working well measures in 
 the emotional  space are, (match up each pair of items in order), given by: 
 
 &amp;lt;t = [Ln &#126;- Ln Â¥;]- Hszs + sztl [Ln zs- Ln Zt]

 (15) 
 
 k 
 
 where szs and szt in equation (14) and szi and szo in equation (15) represent 
 the (understood) cost shares for used up/reduced useful thing/valuable supply Z. The basic difference 
 
 288 
 
 S.K. EHUI AND D.S.C. SPENCER 
 
 between Tst and 'Yio on one hand, and T;P y(0 , on the other hand, is that in 
 the former case the net increase in useful thing/valuable supply stock is treated as an output 
 (benefit) while in the last thing just mentioned case the decrease in the useful thing/valuable supply stock index is 
 treated as a cost. Note that equations (12)-(15), which specify the DennyFuss first order accounting equation, are easily figured out/calculated using only price 
 and amount data, this way eliminating the need for guessing an hidden (under) 
 cost or production structure. 
 5. AN EMPIRICAL EXAMPLE 
 
 This section (shows or proves) how the intertemporal and interspatial total 
 factor working well measures developed in equations (12)-(15) can be used 
 to measure the (the ability to keep something around, or keep something going) and money-based ability to be done of (related to areas near the Equator/hot and humid) farming 
 systems. The data set was created during a four-year study by the United 
 Nations University (UNU) and IITA on the effect of (chopping down trees) and 
 land use on soil, (water science), microclimate and working well in the humid 
 coastal belt of Nigeria (Lal and Ghuman, 1989). Four cropping systems 
 represented A, B, C, D are tested over a two-year period (1986-1988) for 
 which there is a complete and balanced data set. In system A, land was 
 cleared manually and cropped by a local farmer. Yam, melon and plantains 
 were grown in 1986. In 1988, plantain, melon and cassava were grown. In 
 all other systems, the land was cleared by a tractor prepared with a shear 
 blade and cropped by the (people who work to find information). In system B, cassava, maize and 
 cowpea were planted in 1986; only cassava was planted in 1988. In system 
 C, maize and cassava were planted in 1986 and rice in 1988. All crops in 
 system C were grown in alleys formed by hedgerows of nitrogen fixing trees 
 or shrubs. In this system, known as alley cropping, the hedgerows were 
 occasionally trimmed during the cropping season to prevent shading and 
 reduce competition with food crops (Kang et al., 1989). In system D, 
 plantain was grown during the 1986-1988 period. No (material that makes plants grow better) was used in 
 any of the cropping systems. 
 Since the cropping systems have multiple crop outputs, an understood 
 output index is calculated by dividing the total value of all output by a price 
 index received/got by weighing the individual output prices by the money/money income 
 share of each crop. A similar understood input amount index is 
 figured out/calculated as the ratio of total expenses on inputs to the weighted 
 material input price. The last thing just mentioned is measured by an index of all material 
 input prices, weighted by the cost share of each input. A amount index for 
 tools used is figured out/calculated as the ratio of total once-a-year expense on 
 capital input and the understood capital service price. To create an group 
 capital service price we share-weight the price of each category of put into use in the same manner as the group material price index. Capital

 a In system A land was cleared manually and farmed usually/(in the past). Crop grown include yam, 
 melon and plantain in 1986, and cassava in 1988. In systems B, C, and D land was cleared 
 mechanically. Crops grown include cassava, maize and cowpea in 1986 and cassava only in 
 1988. System C is an agroforestry system where crops are grown in alleys formed by trees 
 and shrubs. Maize and cassava were grown in 1986 while only rice was grown in 1988. In 
 system D, plantain was the only crop grown. 
 b In column I there is no correction in soil useful thing/valuable supply stock and flows in Column II only 
 useful thing/valuable supply stock use is corrected for. Column III allows for both the useful thing/valuable supply stock and flows. 
 
 input expenses are defined as the sum of the once-a-year user costs of the 
 tools. These are calculated using the capital recovery factor formula, 
 A= PV[r j1-{ (1 + r )- 1}], where A is the once-a-yearized cost of capital item; 
 PV is the present value of the capital item defined as the purchase price 
 less the present worth of its future save value; t is the guessed lifespan 
 of the capital item; and r is the discount rate. 
 To construct the Divisia index for the soil nutrient stock, we share-weight 
 the total amounts of main soil (vitamins, minerals, protein, etc.); nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), 
 and potassium (K) (in metric tons per hectare) available in the top soil 
 (0-10 em). In deciding/figuring out the cost share for the useful thing/valuable supply stock, we 
 came close to the opportunity cost of each soil nutrient with its replacement cost, (in other words) market price from chemical (material that makes plants grow better). useful thing/valuable supply flows are 
 received/made from as the difference between nutrient (oversupply/large quantity) levels for a given 
 cropping system between 1986 and 1988 (intertemporal working well) or 
 between two competing cropping systems in a given year (interspatial 
 working well). Amounts of available soil N, P, and K per hectare were 
 figured out/calculated using a standard bulk density level of 1.21 gjcm 3 (Lal and 
 Ghuman, 1989). 
 Intertemporal and interspatial working well indices for the four cropping 
 systems were calculated and are reported in Tables 1 and 2. In column I, 
 there is no (change to make better/related to changing something) for changes in useful thing/valuable supply stock (oversupply/large quantity) levels and

 flows. Column II provides working well measures allowing for differences/different versions in 
 the useful thing/valuable supply stock only. In column III, full correction is made by accounting for both changes in the useful thing/valuable supply stock level and the flows. 
 From column III in Table 1, total factor working well increased for 
 systems B and C and (lowered in number/got worse/gotten worse) for systems A and D. Systems B and C 
 produced 6.25 and 11.58 times as much output in 1988 as in 1986 using the 
 1986 input bundle. Therefore, systems B and C can therefore be said to be 
 (able to last/helping the planet) over the two year period of time (or space) since after properly accounting for 
 time-related differences in input quality and amount and useful thing/valuable supply flows and 
 stocks, they produced more than in the reference year (1986). Systems A 
 and D produced only 0.22 and 0.88 as much output in 1988 as in 1986 using 
 the 1986 input bundle. So, A and D can be said to be non-(able to last/helping the planet). 
 Note from Table 1 that completely accounting for changes in useful thing/valuable supply 
 (oversupply/large quantity) levels and flows (in a big way) changes the working well measures. 
 This is especially true for system C, where the hedgerows trees fix 
 air-related nitrogen and recycle (vitamins, minerals, protein, etc.), and system D, where the 
 plantains heavily used up/reduced the soil of its (vitamins, minerals, protein, etc.). Note that in system C, if 
 we do not account for the nitrogen (thing that's given/work that's done) of the trees, the intertemporal working well index is lower than togetherness (column 1), leading to the 
 wrong end/end result that the system is not (able to last/helping the planet). Soil (vitamins, minerals, protein, etc.) 
 increased by 31%, representing nearly 30% of the net money/money income in 1988. 
 This is important to the value of output which explains the high intertemporal working well index number in system C. 
 (in almost the same way), if we do not account for the used up/reduced useful things/valuable supplies in system D, 
 the wrong end/end result would be reached that the system is (able to last/helping the planet). 
 Almost the same  wrong ends/end results are reached when only changes in useful thing/valuable supply 
 (oversupply/large quantity) levels are accounted for and flows are ignored (column II). The 
 
 SUSTAINABILITY AND ECONOMIC VIABILITY OF TROPICAL FARMING SYSTEMS 
 
 291 
 
 stock of soil (vitamins, minerals, protein, etc.) in this system decreased by 23%, representing about 
 8% of the total cost of production. Systems A and B stay steady 
 because although soil (vitamins, minerals, protein, etc.) increased, they represent only 0.7 and 0.1% 
 of the total money/money income in each system. Results in Table 1 confirm that unless 
 differences/different versions in the useful thing/valuable supply flows and stock are fully accounted for, TFP 
 results will be (created unfair thinking in)/(unfair-thinking). The bias depends on the importance of useful thing/valuable supply flow 
 and stock. While an increased (reduced) useful thing/valuable supply stock level serves to 
 reduce (increase) the working well growth rate (column II), the connected 
 change in the useful thing/valuable supply flow has the opposite effect (column III). A positive 
 change in the useful thing/valuable supply stock level is a benefit to the farmer and so 
 adds/gives to improving the (the ability to keep something around, or keep something going) of the system. When the change 
 in the useful thing/valuable supply stock is negative, the farmer faces a cost (though it is 
 hidden) which negatively affects the system's (the ability to keep something around, or keep something going). 
 In Table 2, we compare the money-based ability to be done of cropping systems B, C, 
 and D relative to A. In 1986 after accounting for changes in useful thing/valuable supply 
 (oversupply/large quantity) and flows, systems B and C are shown to be (compared to other things) less 
 productive than the reference base system. The interspatial TFP indices 
 are guessed to be 0.73 and 0.76 for systems B and C, (match up each pair of items in order), 
 pointing to/showing that these systems use (compared to other things) more useful things/valuable supplies and produce a 
 (compared to something else) lower output than system A. Only system D (in which only 
 plantain was grown) is more productive. In 1988, working well indices for all 
 the systems show a different pattern. With interspatial TFP indices of 9.26 
 and 1.12, systems B and C are now found to be more (money-based)/cheaply doable/possible 
 than system A. (in almost the same way), with a TFP index of 0.14, system This  found to be 
 less (money-based)/cheaply doable/possible than the reference base system. The changes in 
 working well measures in 1988 compared to 1986 are (named after/discovered by/caused by) the 
 changes in soil nutrient status over the two-year period. For example, in 
 system C (where crops are grown in association with (containing peas, beans, lentils, etc.) trees), soil 
 (vitamins, minerals, protein, etc.) increased by 2.3% in 1988 compared to system A, with a money/money income 
 share of about 6 percent. In system D, where only plantain is grown, 
 chemical life-creating ability was used up/reduced over time. This is reflected in the lower 1988 
 working well measure. In system D, soil (vitamins, minerals, protein, etc.) decreased by 21% in this 
 system compared to system A representing about 7% of the full cost faced 
 by the farmer in 1988. Soil (vitamins, minerals, protein, etc.) decreased by 16% for system Bin 1988 
 representing about 10 percent of the total cost. As shown in Table 1, when 
 differences/different versions in useful thing/valuable supply stock levels and the flows are not here, 
 working well measures are (created unfair thinking in)/(unfair-thinking). The biases depend on the importance of 
 changes in useful thing/valuable supply stock levels. 
 6. CONCLUDING COMMENTS 
 
 New technologies must be developed in SSA which are (able to last/helping the planet) and 
 (money-based)/cheaply doable/possible. However, there is little guidance in the books as to 
 
 292 
 
 S.K. EHUI AND D.S.C. SPENCER 
 
 what methods are to be used for measuring the (the ability to keep something around, or keep something going) and money-based 
 ability to be done of a production system. In this paper, a model for measuring 
 money-based ability to be done and farming-based (the ability to keep something around, or keep something going) is developed. The approach is based on the idea  of total factor working well and the growth 
 accounting procedure which accounts for the unpriced (thing that's given/work that's done) on 
 valuable thing from nature stock and flows. To measure 'economic ability to be done' and 
 'sustainability', we fight (for something) the interspatial and intertemporal TFP measures of Denny and Fuss (1983). 
 Interspatial TFP measures the money-based ability to be done of one system relative 
 to another at a given period (e.g. crop season), and it is technically defined 
 as the logarithm difference in the indices of the value of outputs of the two 
 production systems minus the logarithm difference in the indices of the 
 value of their inputs, including both ordinary inputs and outputs and 
 the unpriced (thing that's given/work that's done) of valuable thing from nature stock and flows. So, system 
 X is said to be (money-based)/cheaply more doable/possible than system Y if, after fully 
 accounting for (related to space or existing in space) differences in inputs as well as valuable thing from nature stocks 
 and flow, X produces more output than Y. 
 (in almost the same way), intertemporal TFP, which measures the (the ability to keep something around, or keep something going) of a 
 given farming system, is defined as the rate of change of an index of 
 outputs divided by an index of inputs, including both ordinary inputs 
 and outputs and the unpriced (thing that's given/work that's done) of valuable thing from nature stock and 
 flows. A production system will be said to be (able to last/helping the planet) over time, if after 
 fully accounting for time-related differences in factor inputs and valuable thing from nature 
 stocks and flows, it produces, at least the same amount of output as 
 (before that/before now). Intertemporal and interspatial TFP measures can be figured out/calculated 
 using the growth accounting method and money-based index numbers, this way 
 eliminating the need for econometric guesses. 
 In order to account for the unpriced (thing that's given/work that's done) of useful thing/valuable supply stock and 
 flows, a generalized model for measurement of TFP was developed. The 
 useful thing/valuable supply stock was specified as a (related to computers and science) restriction rather than as a 
 ordinary input as in the neoclassical sense. Also, the (thing that's given/work that's done) of crop outputs and useful thing/valuable supply flows (both addition and (everything is gone)) were 
 separately accounted for. We show that TFP is measured as the leftover/extra 
 growth after the rate of growth of output has been set apart and given out among 
 changes in inputs, useful thing/valuable supply (oversupply/large quantity) and flows. We show in particular 
 that when useful thing/valuable supply stock and flows are used (as is always the case in 
 farming) working well measures using ordinary approaches are (created unfair thinking in)/(unfair-thinking) unless changes in useful thing/valuable supply (oversupply/large quantity) levels and flows are accounted 
 for. 
 Using a data set available at the International Institute of (related to areas near the Equator/hot and humid) 
 Farming, the intertemporal and interspatial total factor working well 
 indices for four cropping systems in south-western Nigeria were figured out/calculated. 
 
 SUSTAINABILITY AND ECONOMIC VIABILITY OF TROPICAL FARMING SYSTEMS

 Results showed that the (the ability to keep something around, or keep something going) and money-based ability to be done measures are 
 sensitive to changes in the stock and flows of soil (vitamins, minerals, protein, etc.) as well as to 
 changes in material input uses and outputs. Where the (thing that's given/work that's done) of 
 valuable thing from nature stock and flows are important, such as in the case of 
 alley-cropping system, the measures provide very (much) different results 
 from ordinary TFP approaches. 
 The example used in this study illustrates the effect of changes in soil 
 nutrient status. However, the (connected/related) time frame for (the ability to keep something around, or keep something going) measurement must be longer than the two years used in this study. The 
 appropriate time frame must be figured out by/decided by (trying new things out/testing ideas scientifically) and depends on the attributes of the system being tested. It is a strength of the 
 generalized TFP measures proposed here that they can handle (for only a short time) 
 as well as long-term changes on valuable thing from nature stocks. 
 What's more, only changes in soil nutrient status have been carefully thought about/believed. 
 However, other (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) factors e.g. soil compaction, pest (situation where something is filled with lots of something harmful or disgusting), 
 water quality, wearing away etc. can also be tested. To incorporate these 
 factors in the (the ability to keep something around, or keep something going) measures needs/demands that the relationship between their stocks and flows and the yield of crops or animals be 
 serious and stubborn. With these relationships, prices can be inputed to the inputs 
 and outputs and the necessary intertemporal and interspatial TFP figured out/calculated. The challenge facing (people who work to find information) is to establish the coefficients for 
 the (related to the body function of living things), physical and chemical processes that affect the long-term 
 performance of farming-based systems and to decide/figure out the necessary minimum data set for watching these changes.
