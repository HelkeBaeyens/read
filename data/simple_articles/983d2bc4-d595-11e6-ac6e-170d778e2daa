 ABSTRACT 
 Strauss, J., Barbosa, M., Teixeira, S., Thomas, D. and Junior, R.G., 1991. Role of education 
 and extension in the adoption of technology: a study of upland rice and soybean farmers 
 in Central-West Brazil. Agric. Econ., 5: 341-359. 
 This paper explores reduced form (things that decide other things) of the adoption of certain technologies by 
 upland rice and soybean farmers in the Center-West area of Brazil. We merge community 
 level data on the availability and quality of publicly given infrastructure, mostly 
 extension, to the farm level data containing information on farmer workers as well as 
 land amount and quality. By using community level measures of availability and quality of 
 extension, we avoid problems of endogeneity of farm level measures of extension use. We 
 find good effects of farmer education on the diffusion process, obeying other 
 studies. We also separate effects of the quality in (related to a large area) extension investment as measured by 
 the average experience of technical extension staff. These results point to/show that investments in 
 workers of extension workers does have a payoff in terms of farmer adoption of 
 improved (producing crops/helping something grow) practices. 
 
 1. INTRODUCTION 
 
 Since 1974 the Brazilian government has invested large amounts of useful things/valuable supplies 
 in farming-based research. The knowledge which has been saved, and 
 the technologies which are available, have been adopted by farmers only 
 with a (large/relatively large) lag. What's more, this lag is not the same for all 
 products, for all farmers, for all communities or for all areas. 
 A few factors, including (related to what holds something together and makes it strong) changes in the Brazilian econ0169-5150/91/$03.50

 omy and different farming-based policies, probably add/give to this gap in 
 technology adoption. We focus in this paper on two factors which are 
 important from a public policy point of view: the education of the farmer, 
 and the availability and quality of extension services. Education has been 
 widely discussed as an important (thing that decides something) of production (wasting very little while working or producing something) and 
 technology diffusion (e.g., Welch, 1970; Jamison and Lau, 1982; Feder et al., 
 1985). There are fewer studies of the hit/effect of extension [see Birkhauser et 
 al. (1991) for a survey and Patrick and Kehrberg (1973) for a study of 
 Brazilian agriculture]; many of these studies did not account for the 
 fact that measures of farm level extension contacts should be treated as 
 endogenous and even fewer clearly account for the quality of extension 
 services. We face/deal with both issues. 
 Mixed-up nature in the (related to a large area) composition of farming within Brazil has 
 been explained, in part, by the availability of technology for different crops 
 (Homem de Melo, 1983). We will examine the adoption of a series of 
 technologies by rice and soybean farmers in Goias, Matto Grosso and Matto 
 Grosso do Sul, the three states in the Brazilian Center-West. Since the late 
 1970s, this area has been a large add/giver to farming-based production in 
 Brazil and, now, the Center-West accounts for about a third of the 
 total national area planted with rice, over a quarter of the area planted with 
 soybeans and nearly a fifth of the land planted with rice, soybeans, beans, 
 com and wheat taken together. (related to a large area) produces /gives up are higher than the Brazilian 
 averages for soybeans, com, cassava, cotton and sugar cane; they are lower 
 for wheat and rice, but this is because the all-Brazil average includes 
 watered land of which there is little in the Center-West. 
 There have been big changes in the portion of land to different 
 crops over the last twenty years in Brazil. Maybe one of the most dramatic, 
 and important, events in this process of change is the six times increase of the 
 area planted with soybeans in the Center-West over the last ten years. Upland 
 rice, which is a traditional crop in this area, 1 tends to be helped grow by 
 farmers who (not very long ago) moved to the Center-West. The area planted with 
 rice rose (in a big way) from 1970/71 through to the end of that ten years and 
 has continued to rise since 1985/6 when it pulled out of a spoiled period 
 during the early 1980s (Teixeira, 1987). 
 Using data collected by the Centro Nacional de Pesquisa de Arroz e 
 Feijao (CNPAF) in 1985/86, we will study the (things that decide other things) of the adoption 
 of a series of technologies and cultural practices by upland rice and soybean 
 farmers. Both soybeans and upland rice technologies began to be introduced

 (area of grassy land).

 in the area after 1980. Since no look at how things were in the past information was collected in 
 the survey, we are unable to model the patterns of the diffusion process. 
 We therefore study how the adoption and extent of adoption, of a set of 
 practices at one point in time are affected by farm and farmer (features/ qualities/ traits), together with the availability and quality of publicly given infrastructure. 
 We find, as in other studies, that farmer's education positively affects the 
 adoption of new technology. We separate effects of the quality of (related to a large area) 
 extension investment as measured by the average experience of technical 
 extension staff. These results, which are new to the farm-related diffusion 
 books, point to/show that investments in workers of extension workers 
 does have a payoff in terms of the adoption of better (producing crops/helping something grow) practices by 
 farmers. 
 2. METHODOLOGY 
 
 We view the adoption of technology as an money-based decision based on 
 discounted expected not important benefits and costs. The scientific (detailed description of exactly what is required) 
 used in this paper is agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with a variety of models of farmer or farm 
 household optimization: making the most of expected (money made/good things received), expected utility of 
 (money made/good things received) or expected utility of consumption and fun subject to production 
 function and time restrictions (see Roe and Graham-Tomasi, 1986). For 
 convenience in explaining/big show, let us take the first other choice. Discounted 
 expected (money made/good things received), V( Â· ), will be composed of two parts: the difference in 
 discounted expected value of production of all crops and animals with and 
 without adoption of the particular technology, minus the difference in costs. 
 We can think of this as the difference of two (money made/good thing received) functions, each of which 
 is a function of the base year restrictions and information of farmers. The 
 restriction and information sets include four parts/pieces; two at the farm 
 level and two at the community levels. At the farm level we view as 
 restrictions, firstly, workers factors connected with the farm decision 
 making process and, secondly, wealth factors including the amount and 
 quality of land owned. We view land helped grow (which includes land owned) 
 and other almost-fixed factors, such as machinery, as (able to be changed or moved the way you want) over the time 
 (line in the distance where the Earth and sky meet)  of the farmer, and therefore do not include them as (coming from the outside of something) or 
 pre-decide/figure outd covariates. At the community level, the information set 
 includes the level of farm services, especially extension and input marketing 
 services; and agro-climate factors related to produce levels and (quality that shows weakness because important things aren't steady or strong). 
 Two types of workers, education and experience, are reasonably 
 related to technology adoption. All else equal, both should be positively 
 related to information available to the farmer. Experience may provide 
 general farming knowledge as well as detailed knowledge about his or her 
 
 344 
 
 J_ STRAUSS ET AL 
 
 particular farm, while education may enable the farmer to better process the 
 information given by different sources, and may increase both the 
 allocative and technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) of the farmer (Jamison and Lau, 1982). 
 We assume all farming decisions are made by the household head and use 
 his (or her) years of education as our measure of education, his age as a 
 measure of general farming experience, and the number of years he has lived 
 in the area as a measure of more area-clearly stated/particular experience. We would 
 prefer to use the amount of time the farmer has been farming in the area; 
 unfortunately this information is not available. It would also be useful to 
 distinguish different types of education (such as technical and non-technical 
 schools) but this information was not collected. 
 Since much land is rented, the amount of land helped grow is an input over 
 which farmers have choice, even in the short run, and so it does not belong 
 in a reduced form model. We include, therefore, the amount of land owned 
 by the farmer, which is an indicator of wealth. One may argue that, in the 
 long run, land sales are possible; we take a more medium run (way of seeing things / sensible view of what is and is not important) 
 here, while recognizing that larger farms may result from better managerial 
 ability. The survey provides us with two types of (numbers that change/things that change) relating to farm 
 level land quality; the mountains, land, rivers, etc. of the land (before any leveling or 
 terracing is begun/tried) and the degree of soil wearing away. Both are somewhat 
 (very simple/rough and rude) measures; it might have been useful to have more exact data [see for 
 instance Sidhu and Baanante (1981) or Bhalla (1988) for examples of input 
 demand and produce analyses which point to/show the usefulness of good land 
 quality data]. 
 Previous studies of farm technology adoption have used almost the same  (detailed descriptions of exactly what is required); farmer education is almost always included, although experience 
 measures other than age are almost never available; sometimes land quality data 
 are also included. It is unusual, however, to find studies that use community 
 level (numbers that change/things that change) other than prices. We would argue, however, that the availability and quality of extension input put into use and marketing services 
 probably influence the adoption process, as do agro-(related to the Earth's weather) (numbers that change/things that change) such 
 as rainfall distribution [see Birkhauser et al. (1991) for a survey of the 
 extension impact literature]. We take two approaches to modeling community influences. 
 We first include rnicroregion-level dummy (numbers that change/things that change) to take by force/take control of these 
 effects in an randomly general way; these are fixed effect guesses. Secondly, we include (numbers that change/things that change) designed to measure the community factors 
 directly. 2 
 2 We cannot hope to take by force/take control of all factors which influence farmer decisions; what we hope to 
 do is identify among these factors, those which have a large influence on technology 
 adoption. 
 
 UPLAND RICE AND SOYBEAN FARMERS IN CENTRAL-WEST BRAZIL 
 
 345 
 
 Among the community factors, we include 'municipio' -level mean and 
 standard mistakes of rice and soybean yields. These are taken from 7 
 years of data on municipio-level rice and soybean area and production. The 
 source is independent of the sample, so there are no (not made by nature/fake) relationships 
 arising from data construction. Yields reflect, in part, past adoption of 
 technology. They also reflect hidden (under) agro-(related to the Earth's weather) (possible greatness or power), which will 
 itself affect technology adoption. We use group, municipio-level yield 
 measures to (record by a camera or computer) municipio effects which may be related to farmlevel adoption. By doing so we reduce problems of endogeneity that would 
 be greater if we used farm-level yields. 
 A second set of (numbers that change/things that change) tries to measure the level of services 
 available to formers. We do not use information at the farm level, such as 
 whether he or she has regular visits from an extension agent, because this 
 would be endogenous in our model. In particular extension visits may arise 
 because both the agent and the farmer want them. Agents may go to better 
 farm managers on better land (or land closer to their offices) to 
 (make as big as possible) their hit/effect. Gave/given there is useful information to extend there 
 is likely to be more demand for it by better farmers on better gave/given land. 
 This way including in something of a farm level (number or thing that changes) on extension contact is likely to give 
 an upward (created unfair thinking in)/(unfair-thinking) coefficient on extension, as well as (unfairly influencing an opinion) downwards the 
 education, experience and land quality coefficients. This may explain the 
 positive extension and negative education effects reported in the study of 
 Brazilian farming by Patrick and Kehrberg (1973). 
 The availability and quality of extension and other services at the community level may be more reasonably taken as (coming from the outside of something) to farmers. We have 
 gathered, independently from the farm survey, municipio level data on the 
 number of EMATER (Empresa Helpencia Technica (away from cities)e - a state-level 
 extension (service business/government unit/power/functioning)) technicians, their average experience in EMATER and the 
 proportion who have at least a BS degree. In addition we have collected 
 information on whether the municipio is served by a cooperative or a radio 
 diffusion program, whether storage facilities are available (from CIBRAZEM - a public storage (service business/government unit/power/functioning)), and the number of banks which serve the 
 municipio. 
 Based on the sample, we construct the percentage of farmers who have 
 contact with EMBRAPA (Empresa Brasiliera de Pesquisa Agropecuaria the national farming-based research (service business/government unit/power/functioning)). Since there are too few sample 
 (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) in each municipio to use that as a meaningful level of grouping, we define this (number or thing that changes) at the larger microregion level. 3 
 Explanation suggests prices should also enter the reduced form. Unfortunately 
 we only have data on prices at the state level; since the survey covers three 
 3

 346

 states, there are not enough degrees of freedom to guess price effects. To 
 the extent that prices are related to watched/followed farm and community 
 (features/ qualities/ traits), these guesses will be (created unfair thinking in)/(unfair-thinking) by the (something left out) of prices 
 although the fixed effects guesses (which include micro-area controls) 
 will not be contaminated. 
 Having defined our (numbers that change/things that change) we can outline the (related to studying numbers) model. Let 
 
 (1) 
 be the discounted expected (money made/good things received) function using the adopted technology 
 for the ith farm, where x; is a vector of (features/ qualities/ traits) defined above and e; 
 is a random error. Let 
 
 (2) 
 be discounted expected (money made/good things received) without the new practice. Let v; = v;A- v;N, 
 then if v; &amp;gt; 0 the technology or cultural practice is adopted, and not if 
 v; &amp;lt; 0. Note that we think about/believe each practice separately. We do not watched/followed 
 v; and e; but we do watch/notice both X; and whether the practice is adopted or 
 not. Let D; = 1 if the practice is adopted, that is if v; &amp;gt; 0, then we have a 
 standard model of (not numbers-based) choice. If e; is assumed to be a Gaussian 
 random variate with mean zero and unit variance, then the (related to studying numbers) model 
 is a probit and can be guessed by maximum chance. Two dependent 
 (numbers that change/things that change) are continuous 4 and are fitted by the method of least squares. 
 3. DESCRIPTION OF DATA 
 
 The data are drawn from a survey of rice and soybean farmers in the 
 Center-West managed and did/done at CNPAF (Teixeira, 1987; Barbosa and Teixeira, 
 1987). Its main purpose was to explain, at the farm level, the reasons for the 
 (act of something getting bigger, wider, etc.) of soybeans, sometimes at the expense of food crops such as rice, 
 and to show the forms of production. The sample areas were 
 selected based on total land and production data for the two crops from 
 1973 to 1984. The municipios were selected based on the increase over time 
 of soybeans area and the decrease during the 1980's of rice areas. Two 
 hundred farmers were surveyed, of which complete data (including community data on (set of machines)) are available for 161 farmers. Of these, 50% are in 
 Goias, and 25% each in Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul. Added/more 
 data, collected at the municipio level, describe the level of (set of machines) 
 in the farming-based part/area; these include information on storage and banking 
 4 
 
 They are an index of technology adoption and (material that makes plants grow better) use per hectare. Since almost all 
 farmers use some (material that makes plants grow better), data censoring at zero is not a problem.

 facilities, extension and education services, as well as a time series on area 
 planted and production of rice and soybeans. 
 Table 1 shows that farms in the Center-West are large: the average farmer 
 owns about 590 ha of land which is a little under 80% of the land he farms. 
 The proportion of land rented falls with the size of the farm owned (but 
 remains very steady and solid across the distribution of farms operated). Farms 
 tend to be (a) little larger in Mato Grosso do Sul. Most of the land on 
 the sample farms is planted with soybeans; among farmers who own less 
 than 100 hectares of land, soybean (producing crops/helping something grow) accounts for about 60% of 
 their farms but around one-half of farms operated by the larger landowners. 
 Rice accounts for about 8% of the farmed land and that proportion also 
 declines with the amount of land owned by the farmer. The proportion of 
 farmland given to (areas of grassy land) and fields rises with farmer wealth and accounts 
 for one fifth of the farm area of larger landholders. Forest and unproductive 
 land is much less common on land of small farmers; these farmers rent land 
 almost only for planting once-a-year crops. Soybean yields, which are 
 higher than rice yields, show little pattern across the distribution of 
 landowners; rice yields on farms of small landowners are about a quarter 
 larger than those of large landowners. 
 Most of the farmers in the sample are traveling workers from other areas in 
 Brazil, especially the South, and 60% of them have moved to the CenterWest in the last 10 years. Farmers who own more land tend to be older, have 
 more experience in these edge of something/unexplored area areas and have more education. The 
 relationships between land owned and age, experience and education are 
 non-linear: farmers who own less than 100 ha (one-third of the sample) have 
 much less experience in the Center-West and also less education. The 
 pattern of experience hints that farmers are buying more land the longer 
 they stay in the area. 
 For both soybeans and upland rice, the (features/ qualities/ traits) of fields used and 
 the frequency of adoption of different cultural practices and technologies, are 
 reported in Table 2 for all farmers and layered by three farmer education 
 levels. Overall field (features/ qualities/ traits) are almost the same  for the two crops. Upland rice 
 is more likely to be grown on flatter lands; less educated farmers tend to 
 plant upland rice on flatter land and better educated farmers tend to plant 
 soybeans on flatter land. 
 Soil analysis is more common on soybeans fields. Use of some (material that makes plants grow better) is 
 nearly universal, however use of cover (material that makes plants grow better) is not. Almost one half of 
 soy plantings make use of seeds innoculated for nitrogen constant thought abilities and about three-quarters of rice seeds are treated for disease. Almost 
 half the rice plots are planted with seeds which are certified by the Ministry 
 of Farming and distributed by cooperatives and private firms. Soybean 
 seeds are planted in holes (the preferred method) on about a third of the 
 
 350 
 
 J. STRAUSS ET AL. 
 
 plots. Fifteen percent of the area planted to rice had blast problems and 
 some 10% of farmers treat their fields for blast. 
 For many cultural practices, better educated farmers put into use practices 
 which are preferred by farming-based (people who work to find information) and extensionists. For both 
 rice and soybeans, better educated farmers are more likely to carefully study the soil, use cover (material that makes plants grow better), use more of all (material that makes plants grow better) types per hectare and are 
 more likely to use treated seeds. The better educated farmers are more likely 
 to use certified rice seed. 
 Farm experts at CNPAF and CPAC (Centro de Pesquisa Agropecuaria do 
 Cerrado) have assigned a score to each soybean farmer based on the 
 appropriateness of the package of technologies chosen. As expected, 
 better educated farmers tend to score better on this index (out of 100) 
 although there is a large standard moving away around the mean. 
 Table 3 provides means and standard mistakes of farmer access to 
 community (set of machines). Each municipio has, on average, just under four 
 EMATER technicians, each of whom has, on average, eight years of experience in the Center-West area and two of whom are likely to have a 
 Bachelor degree. Average (related to a large area) experience of extension agents within a 
 municipio ranges from one year to fifteen. There are about five banks in 
 each municipio, some municipios having none; the majority are served by a 
 co-operative and have access to CIBRAZEM storage facilities although only 
 a third receive diffusion information by radio. Over the previous six years,

 rice yields in the area. 
 4. TECHNOLOGY AND CULTURAL PRACTICES: REGRESSION RESULTS 
 
 Not all of the technology information collected in the survey is used in 
 the moving backward analysis. Some practices are put into use by almost everyone and 
 others by very few farmers; for these, there is no difference/different version to explain. Some 
 practices, such as use of herbicides for soybean farmers, are very hard to 
 explain with the covariates we use; others are (good or well enough) close to those we 
 do report that they provide no added/more information. We focus on nine 
 practices, five for upland rice and four for soybeans. They are whether the 
 farmer does soil analysis (for both rice and soybean fields); whether the 
 farmer uses certified rice seed or innoculated soybean seed; whether he uses 
 cover (material that makes plants grow better) (for rice) and total (material that makes plants grow better) usage per hectare (for rice and 
 soybeans); whether action is taken against rice blast (brusone); whether 
 soybean fields are planted in (preferred) holes (or whether rows are used). 
 Each (thing that changes (like a test score) because of something else that you control (like study time)) is guessed alone; these (moving backwards) cannot, 
 therefore, take account of complementarities in (related to computers and science) practices. We 
 include the CNPAF farm experts' index of soybean cultural practices as the 
 tenth (thing that changes (like a test score) because of something else that you control (like study time)), treating it as a continuous (thing that changes (like a test score) because of something else that you control (like study time)). 
 Depending on this index alone is unlikely to be a good scientific plan; we 
 therefore think about/believe it along with the (moving backwards) explaining the 
 adoption of individual practices. 
 The moving backward results, presented in Tables 4.1 and 4.2 for soybean and 
 rice (producing crops/helping something grow) (match up each pair of items in order), are discussed by group of covariates. The 
 microregion-fixed effects guesses are in the first column of each pair; the 
 community-level (features/ qualities/ traits) are included in the second column. We 
 discuss, firstly, the effect of farmer workers on the (things that change (like test scores) because of other things that you control (like study times)), secondly, the effect of farm-level land amount and quality (numbers that change/things that change), 
 thirdly the extension availability and quality (numbers that change/things that change), and finally the 
 community-level agro-(related to the Earth's weather) and (set of machines) (numbers that change/things that change). 
 Farmer education and experience effects 
 
 Education of the farm operator has a positive effect, significant at the 
 10% level, in six of the ten (moving backwards) with microregion fixed effects and in 
 four when municipio level covariates replace the microregion dummies. The 
 overall index of soy (producing crops/helping something grow) practices rises six-tenths of a point for each 
 year of education. Part of this reflects that better educated soybean farmers 
 use more (material that makes plants grow better) (per ha). Better educated rice growers are more likely 
 to do soil analysis and use cover (material that makes plants grow better). All of these effects are strong to

 including either area dummy (numbers that change/things that change) or area-clearly stated/particular (features/ qualities/ traits). Education has a significant positive effect only in the micro-area fixed 
 effects (moving backwards) in two cases: the chance of doing soil analysis for 
 soybean farmers and the amount of (material that makes plants grow better) used by rice farmers. This 
 difference in results between the two (detailed descriptions of exactly what is required) hints that there may 
 be interaction effects between education and community (set of machines); no 
 interactions, however, are (meaningful numbers) in the (moving backwards) using 
 area (features/ qualities/ traits). 
 The age of the farmer, which is assumed to be a substitute for general 
 experience, does not explain any of the adoption patterns. Time spent in the 
 current area of residence is, however, strongly positively related for rice 
 farmers to the use of methods to control blast and for soybean bean farmers 
 to the chance of using preferred planting ways of doing things. This hints that 
 learning about the particular conditions of the Center-West area, and how 
 to deal with them, does happen for these farmers, who, recall, are mostly 
 people (who enter a country) from the South. 
 Land amount and quality 
 The total area of land owned by the farmer is unrelated to the adoption of 
 new technology except that richer farmers are more likely to use certified 
 rice seed. Mountains, land, rivers, etc. does seem to be related to the use of preferred 
 practices for soybean farmers. Farmers owning less level land are more 
 likely to plant with preferred methods and use more (material that makes plants grow better) per ha. For 
 upland rice farmers mountains, land, rivers, etc. has less hit/effect, except for a positive effect 
 on the use of cover (material that makes plants grow better) on farms with steeper slopes. The presence of 
 soil wearing away is related to lower chances of using preferred planting 
 methods for soybeans, but is not significantly related to other cultural 
 practices. All of the land amount and quality effects are strong to the 
 including in something of either microregion controls or community (set of machines) (features/ qualities/ traits). 
 (related to a large area) service availability 
 Farmer (features/ qualities/ traits), in particular education and possibly local experience, can explain part of the (related to computers and science) adoption choice. They do not, 
 however, explain all the difference/different version in the data and, in fact, the microregion 
 dummies are both/together significant in all the (moving backwards). There is, (based on what's seen or what seems obvious), a 
 good deal of difference/different version which can be explained by community (set of machines) 
 (features/ qualities/ traits); we turn next to their hit/effect on the adoption of technology.

 Extension and research availability and quality. We experimented with the 
 including in something of three EMATER extension (features/ qualities/ traits): the number of technicians (or technicians per farm), the proportion with a bachelor degree and 
 their average years of experience. These turn out to be too collinear for any 
 strong results to come out, although they are both/together significant in some 
 cases. Some regularities do appear when only EMATER experience is 
 included in the (moving backwards). Farmers in municipios where EMATER technicians have more experience have higher scores of the soybean technology 
 index and tend to use soybean seeds which are innoculated. These farmers 
 also tend to take soil analyses on their rice plots and use certified rice seed. 
 The effects of an added year of experience by EMATER technicians is 
 just like, and sometimes larger than, the effect of a year of farmer 
 education. Interactions between EMATER experience and farmer education 
 proved not to be significant (not reported). Larger samples may be necessary 
 to test for substitutability or (when two things work together equally well) between these factors. 
 (material that makes plants grow better) use is not connected with extension agent experience, nor is 
 using methods to control blast. Also planting soybeans using preferred 
 methods is negatively related to extension agent experience. Still the results 
 do suggest a role for the quality of extension agents, in a rude way/in a very simple way measured, in 
 improving the effectiveness of extension agents (Feder and Slade, 1984). 
 The proportion of farmers (in the microregion) who have contact with 
 EMBRAPA personnel has no effect on soybean practices but does affect 
 upland rice farming practices. In particular the use of soil analyses, cover 
 (material that makes plants grow better) and the amount per hectare of (material that makes plants grow better) use are all positively 
 related to the extent of EMBRAPA contacts within a area. 
 The net good effects of EMBRAPA and EMATER service availability is quite interesting and possibly important. In unreported probits 
 explaining the chance of a farmer having EMBRAPA or EMATER 
 contacts it was found that being better educated and younger made it more 
 likely to have contacts from EMBRAPA. EMBRAPA also seems to work 
 more in municipios with levelland, no radio diffusion programs and with 
 CIBRAZEM storage facilities. EMATER contacts are more likely in areas 
 with low soybean produces and those served by EMATER technicians with 
 more experience. 
 Other community (set of machines). The other community covariates appear to 
 have little hit/effect on the adoption of these (producing crops/helping something grow) practices, although 
 there are a few important/famous exceptions. The existence of a cooperative office in a 
 municipio is positively related to using preferred planting methods for 
 soybeans. The number of banks in a municipio seems to increase the 
 chance of taking soil analyses and increasing (material that makes plants grow better) use on soybean 
 plots. The use of innoculated seeds seems to be negatively connected with

 the number of banks. The existence of a radio diffusion program has a 
 positive effect only on the chance of using innoculated seeds but has no 
 hit/effect on any of the other technology practices: radio diffusion seems to be 
 a poor substitute for extension services. The existence of CIBRAZEM 
 storage facilities in a municipio is positively connected with the use of 
 preferred planting practices for soybeans, but tends to be negatively related 
 to (material that makes plants grow better) use, soil analysis and using certified seed for rice. Why is not 
 clear. The existence of CIBRAZEM facilities tends to be in larger centers so 
 there (based on what's seen or what seems obvious) is some unmeasured effect that these areas have on certain 
 farming practices. 
 (related to a large area) agro-(related to the Earth's weather) conditions 
 
 Agro-(related to the Earth's weather) conditions are proxied at the mumc1p10 level by mean 
 soybean and rice yields, and the standard moving away of those yields over a 
 7-year period (1979/80-1985/86). 
 Only a few results come out  for upland rice; more (material that makes plants grow better) (per hectare) 
 and certified seed is more likely to be used in more productive municipios 
 (those with higher mean yields) although the (quality of changing over time or at different places) of yields has no 
 effect on cultural practices. Soybeans are more likely to be planted with 
 preferred methods in higher produce and higher variance municipios; treated 
 seeds are more likely to be used in better gave/given areas. 
 5. SUMMARY 
 
 These results suggest that it is possible to identify some of the (things that decide other things) of the adoption of new technologies and cultural practices, at least 
 within the simple static model organized and listed in Section 2. Of the factors thought about/believed farmer education stands out as being important for both upland rice 
 and soybean technology adoption, as does the quality of extension agents. 
 The former result is agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with many studies in the books. 
 Rather few studies, however, have examined the hit/effect of extension services 
 in a reduced form model. Of these we are not aware of other studies which 
 clearly examine the role of the workers of extension agents. 
 In sum, better educated farmers are more likely to do soil analyses and 
 use (material that makes plants grow better) on both rice and soy plots, farmers in areas with more 
 experienced EMATER agents are more likely to use treated or certified 
 seeds and use preferred planting methods again on both rice and soybean 
 plots. Relative to soybean farmers rice farmers are more (able to reply or react/quick to respond) to 
 contact with EMBRAPA personnel and also to higher yields. Farmers with 
 more experience tend to put into use preferred planting methods (on soybean 
 plots) or controls for blast (on rice plots).

 It would be better than explain both the extent and process of (related to computers and science) adoption by farmers; this would be possible only with (related to studying things over a long time) 
 data in which each farmer is watched and followed/made footprints of over a few seasons. The results 
 reported above suggest that it may be smart for both (related to studying things over a long time) and 
 cross section surveys to put into use a wider plan to data collection on 
 technology adoption than is commonly found. Especially, in addition to 
 (related to computers and science) use data, it would be good to collect information on 
 the workers and (how money affects people's lives) (features/ qualities/ traits) of farmers, on indicators of land quality and on community level factors. Community-level 
 (numbers that change/things that change) should include both those related to hidden (under) agro-(related to the Earth's weather) 
 potentials and those related to the availability of (connected/related) farm services. We 
 think that widening the extent of/the range of these surveys will have high not important 
 returns in terms of helping program evaluators and policy makers understand the processes hidden (under) (related to computers and science) adoption.
