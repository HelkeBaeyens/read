 Abstract 
 The double hurdle model is used to analyse the off-farm labour decisions of small-scale farming-based household members 
 in the Shamva District of Zimbabwe. The approach permits the combined modelling of the decision to participate in the labour 
 market and the decision (related to/looking at/thinking about) the amount of time gave out to work. Results point to/show that some (numbers that change/things that change) (famously, 
 (male/female status), education and valuable things) in fact have effects which are (not numbers-based) and (numbers-based) different in terms of participation 
 and hours worked. Overall, the scientific analysis confirms the importance of individual (features/ qualities/ traits) (such as (male/female status) and 
 education) and household/farm (features/ qualities/ traits) (e.g. land area (easy to get to, use, or understand) to the household, productive valuable things, payments and 
 the farming-based terms of trade) in influencing the labour market decisions of (away from cities) household members.

 1. Introduction 
 There is increasing (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) that (away from cities) non-farm 
 income is an important useful thing/valuable supply for (away from cities) families 
 and that policy-makers are showing increasing interest in non-farm activities as a means of creating 
 good/willing conditions to reduce poorness in areas away from cities 
 (FAO, 1998). Although there is some debate about the 
 hit/effect of non-farm employment on the distribution of 
 income (see, for example, Reardon et al., 2001), it is 
 generally agreed that non-farm income is a significant 
 input to (away from cities) household (processes of people making, selling, and buying things) and adds/gives

 to food security by allowing better access to food. It 
 also has positive spin-offs in farming-based performance 
 by providing cash for working well-improving inputs, 
 this way (reducing/ slowing/ slowly moving) credit restrictions, and in turn, a more 
 energetic farming-based part/area improves the extent and/the range and 
 scale of the non-farm part/area. If policy helping actions 
 are to be directed at increasing money-based activity and 
 employment in areas away from cities, a better understanding of 
 the labour portion decisions of (away from cities) families 
 is needed/demanded. This paper aims to add/give this way by analysing the off-farm labour decisions of 
 families in the Shamva District of Zimbabwe. 
 The focus of the scientific work reported here is the 
 labour portion decisions (related to/looking at/thinking about) off-farm work 
 of adult members of (away from cities) families. The analysis, 
 based on survey data on 1183 adults, (asks lots of questions about/tries to find the truth about) the

 influence on those decisions of personal (features/ qualities/ traits), household (features/ qualities/ traits) (such as household 
 composition) and (coming from the outside of something) factors (such as location). 
 The double hurdle model is chosen as the research 
 method as it allows the combined modelling of: (i) the decision whether or not to participate in the labour market; 
 and (ii) the amount of time the person (who was part of a study, etc.) sets apart to 
 off-farm work. 
 The layout of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, 
 a brief description of the possible big picture, based 
 on the farming-based household model, is presented. 
 Section 3 outlines the double hurdle model, the approach chosen for the scientific analysis. Section 4 
 introduces the dataset used, and the scientific findings are carefully thought about/believed in Section 5. The paper ends/decides 
 with a discussion of policy effects/results/suggestions.

 2. The possible model 
 
 a' 
 
 The popular (away from cities) household money-based model (see, 
 for example, Singh et al., 1986; Sadoulet and de 
 Janvry, 1995) provides a possible basis for exploring labour supply decisions. Here, we change  a version 
 suggested by Benjamin and Guyomard (1994). Assume for simpleness a two-person household which 
 tries to (make as big as possible) a utility function in fun time 
 f 
 m 
 f 
 and household income, U(Lm 
 e , Le , Y ; E , E , H), 
 f represent the fun time of the male 
 and 
 L 
 where Lm 
 e 
 e 
 and female household member, Em and Ef the vectors of their individual (features/ qualities/ traits), such as human 
 capital, Y the household income, and H a vectors of 
 household (features/ qualities/ traits). A household making up 
 only one male and one female is chosen simply to 
 illustrate a multi-person household and should not 
 be taken as a strong sign of a typical household in the 
 study area. In fact, within the sample, there are farmers (mostly female) with (person who did not attend class or an event) (husband or wife)s, farmers 
 with children but no (husband or wife)s, families headed by 
 children or young adults, and other household types. 
 The household faces the following restrictions: 
 j 
 
 j 
 
 j 
 
 T j = Li + Lo + Le 
 j 
 
 Li a¥ 0, 
 Y 
 
 j 
 
 Lo a¥ 0, 
 
 where Li represents labour time spent on the farm, Lo 
 the labour time off-farm, and each member has a fixed 
 availability of time, T j . Household income, Y, is related to: (i) the restricted (may or may not happen, depending on something) profit function 
 (Ï), which in turn depends on the price of farming-based 
 output (p), changeable input prices (v), on-farm labour 
 j 
 of household members (Li ,) and their individual atj 
 messages of thanks (E ), household (features/ qualities/ traits) (H), and other 
 fixed farm inputs (A), such as land; (ii) off-farm inj 
 come, making up off-farm work time (Lo ), valued at 
 j 
 the (pertaining to each person or thing) wage rate (wo ); and (iii) payments (R). 
 Assuming the usual (happening over and over again in a predictable way) properties for the 
 (money made/good thing received) and utility functions, an best portion of 
 household time can be received/made from. Given our focus on 
 off-farm work, it is convenient to further assume an 
 j 
 interior solution for all choices except Lo . Then, the 
 necessary conditions for a maximum are: 
 
 (j = m, f), 
 j 
 
 Le a¥ 0 
 
 (1) 
 (j = m, f), 
 
 f 
 m 
 f 
 m m 
 = Ï(p, v, Lm 
 i , Li , A, E , E , H) + wo Lo 
 + wfo Lfo + R,

 and

 j

 aU/aY 
 
 (j = m, f), 
 
 (5) 
 
 where Î»j represents the Lagrange multipliers connected 
 with positivity restrictions on off-farm work. 
 Eq. (4) points to/shows that the tax rate of substitution of on-farm family labour for money income 
 should be equaled the shadow price of that labour. If 
 the household member works off-farm, Eq. (5) states 
 that the tax rate of substitution of off-farm work 
 for income should equal the market wage rate. If the 
 tax rate of substitution of off-farm work for income goes beyond the off-farm wage rate, the household 
 member does not work off farm. 
 For an individual household member, the decision 
 whether or not to participate in off-farm employment 
 will depend on a comparison of the market wage rate 
 j 
 and the person's reservation wage, wr , such that: 
 j 
 
 Lo = 0, 
 
 if 
 
 wir a¥ wo 
 
 j 
 
 (j = m, f),

 j 
 
 (j = m, f).

 and 
 j 
 
 Lo = 0, 
 (3) 
 
 (j = m, f), 
 
 The reservation wage is an endogenous (number or thing that changes), 
 which will depend on the other (coming from the outside of something) (numbers that change/things that change) in 
 
 I. Matshe, T. Young / Farming-based Money flow 30 (2004) 175-186 
 
 the model (output and input prices, fixed farm factors, 
 individual and household (features/ qualities/ traits)). (numbers that change/things that change) 
 that raise the reservation wage reduce the chance 
 of participation, while (numbers that change/things that change) that raise the market 
 wage rate, increase the chance of looking (for) off-farm 
 employment. 
 
 3. The (related to studying numbers) model 
 The study is based on micro-level data collected 
 over a (compared to other things) short survey period. As is typical 
 of such data, some families and some people 
 within families have no watched/followed labour time gave out to some household activities. This presents/causes a problem for the (person who works to find information), as standard moving backward analysis 
 can be being dishonest to in these facts or conditions (that surround someone). Zero (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) on off-farm labour time may arise for some reasons. An individual may not be a person (who was part of a study, etc.) 
 in the labour market, because of personal preferences, 
 not enough qualifications or other disability. Or, some people may be people (who were part of a study, etc.) (potential 
 workers) who chose not to work at the current level 
 of money-based (rewards or reasons for doing something).1 
 One approach would be to use the well-known Tobit model.2 However, a disadvantage of that model 
 is that all zero (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) on hours worked are understood/explained as corner solutions, (in other words) the person is assumed to be a person (who was part of a study, etc.) in the labour market who 
 chooses not to work at the current level of (coming from the outside of something) 
 (numbers that change/things that change), such as wages. A further restriction of the 
 Tobit is that both the decision to participate and the 
 amount of hours gave out to an activity given participation are figured out by/decided by the same (numbers that change/things that change), and that 
 a (number or thing that changes) that increases the chance of participation also increases the number of hours worked. So, 
 for example, the possibility that an person's edu1 A third possibility is that, due to other household promises, 
 off-farm work may be done/tried only on an rare basis and 
 the survey is managed and did/done at a time when no off-farm work was 
 searched for/tried to get. However, given the survey design and the timing of our 
 survey, this is unlikely to arise in our study and is not (examined closely) 
 here. 
 2 Some recent studies have modelled the participation decision 
 alone and guessed a Probit model (e.g. Lanjouw, 2001; 
 Ferreira and Lanjouw, 2001) or a Logit model (e.g. Ruben and Van 
 den Berg, 2001). These studies ignore the possibly important 
 'hours of work' decision. 
 
 177 
 
 cation has a strong good effect on the decision to 
 work off farm but a very small or even negative effect 
 on the number of hours worked would be prevented. 
 An other choice is to model as two separate decisions: (i) whether or not to participate in the labour 
 market; and (ii) the amount of time the person (who was part of a study, etc.) 
 sets apart to off-farm work. The reasons for separating 
 these decisions are double. First, due to social or 
 mental drives, the individual may prefer not 
 to work at off-farm work whatever the values of 
 (coming from the outside of something) (numbers that change/things that change). Second, an individual may be a 
 possible person (who was part of a study, etc.) in the off-farm labour market but 
 for certain levels of (connected/related) (numbers that change/things that change), decide not to 
 work off-farm. The former represents (not voting), the 
 latter a corner solution. 
 One widely used approach in this big picture  is 
 Heckman's sample selection model (Heckman, 1979), 
 which is designed to account for the fact that the watched/followed sample may be non-random. A Probit model 
 for the participation or 'selection' equation is guessed and a moving backward model, which is corrected 
 for selectivity bias,3 is specified to account for the 
 level of activity. Although better than the Tobit, 
 this approach is still (serving to severely limit or control).4 None of the zero 
 (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) are due to a corner solution in the hours 
 of work equation. If a (number or thing that changes) affects the hours of 
 work, it cannot (one after the other) lead to reduced and then 
 zero hours worked, although if it appears in the participation equation, it may have that effect (Ghadim 
 et al., 1999). 
 The double hurdle model, developed at first by 
 Cragg (1971), offers a more general approach to modelling participation and hours worked as two separate 
 decisions. The approach has been widely put into use in 
 the personal demand books (Atkinson et al., 1984; 
 Garcia and Labeaga, 1996; Jones, 1989; Blaylock and 
 Blissard, 1992; Burton et al., 2000) and the farming-based 
 technology adoption books (Coady, 1995; Ghadim 
 et al., 1999). Although it has also been used to study 
 labour supply decisions (e.g. Blundell et al., 1987), it 
 has not been applied, to our knowledge, in any study 
 3 Specifically, the guessed inverse Mills ratio, came/coming from 
 the Probit results, is used as an added move backwardor in the OLS 
 equation. 
 4 Johnston and DiNardo (1997, Section 13.12.2) also caution 
 that the Heckman approach is sensitive to violations of hidden (under) 
 ideas (you think are true).

 of labour decisions of (away from cities) farming-based smallholders 
 in developing countries. 
 In the double hurdle model, if we watch/notice hours of 
 work a two-stage process must have been completed. 
 First, the individual has decided to participate in the 
 labour market, and second, has set apart and given out some amount 
 of time to off-farm work. The result/resulting/statement is that no work 
 time may be watched/followed either because of the participation decision or the hours of work decision. It may be 
 assumed that for each decision the individual weighs 
 up the utility difference of each course of action but 
 as these calculations cannot be watched/followed directly, the 
 model operates by assuming the existence of two hidden/covered up (numbers that change/things that change): y1a--a-- , connected with the person's decision to participate in the off-farm labour market, and 
 y2a--a-- , connected with the decision of how many hours 
 to work off farm. These are linear functions of the first 
 and second hurdle move backwardors, x1 and x2 , (match up each pair of items in order): 
 y1a--a-- = x1 Î²1 + u1 , 
 
 (8) 
 
 y2a--a-- = x2 Î²2 + u2 . 
 
 (9) 
 
 So, x1 represents those (numbers that change/things that change) used to explain the 
 participation decision and x2 represents those (numbers that change/things that change) 
 used to explain the hours of work decision. If we represent an (unobservable) index (number or thing that changes) as y1a-- = 1, if 
 the individual decides to participate, and y1a-- = 0, otherwise, then: 
 y1a-- = 1, 
 
 y1a--a-- &amp;gt; 0, 
 
 if 
 
 and 
 y1a-- = 0, 
 
 otherwise. 
 
 If it is assumed that the error term u1 is (usually/ in a common and regular way) distributed, the first hurdle goes along with a Probit model. 
 Turning to the hours of work equation, (may or may not happen, depending on something) 
 upon clearing the first hurdle, off-farm labour, y2a-- , is 
 created as: 
 y2a-- = y2a--a-- , 
 
 if 
 
 y2a--a-- &amp;gt; 0, 
 
 and 
 y2a-- = 0, 
 
 otherwise, 
 
 (in other words) the second hurdle takes the form of a Tobit model, 
 and is able to generate zero levels of off-farm 
 labour, independent of the first hurdle. 
 
 The watched/followed hours of work, y, is figured out by/decided by 
 the interaction of both hurdles: 
 y = y1a-- y2a-- . 
 
 (10) 
 
 So, if we watch/notice an individual working off-farm, 
 he/she must be both a person (who was part of a study, etc.) in the market, and 
 have decided on a positive level of work time. Zero 
 hours of off-farm work can be created by a 'failure' 
 at either or both of the hurdles. 
 It is further assumed that the hidden/covered up (numbers that change/things that change) have 
 a bivariate (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) distribution: 
 1 ÏÏ 
 (u1 , u2 ) a¼ BVN(0, Î£), Î£ = 
 . 
 (11) 
 ÏÏ Ï 2 
 As Blaylock and Blissard (1992) point out, this general model nests some other creations. For 
 example, when Ï is restricted to being equal to zero 
 the model collapses to the independent Cragg model.5 
 The Tobit model is nested within the independent double hurdle model (Ï = 0) when it is further assumed 
 that the chance of participation is 1. 
 4. Data 
 The survey that created the dataset used in 
 this study was managed and did/done over 34 weeks during 
 the 1996-1997 crop year as part of a project on 
 meso-scale (away from cities) market changes in the Shamva District of Zimbabwe. The district is divided into 24 
 wards, of which 13 are in shared areas 
 and 6 in (the act of moving people to live in a new place) areas. The sample, representing 
 10% of the total number of families in the area, 
 was drawn from across the district in an attempt to 
 capture a wide range of (related to how much money and power people have) and (related to where mountains, rivers, cities, etc., are located) conditions. The data are based on a very 
 short recall period and most of the responses were, 
 wherever possible, (checked for truth/proved true). The survey was designed 
 to gather data on a wide range of issues including a 
 complete study of the household (process of people making, selling, and buying things). 
 The focus here is on individual adult members of the 
 household and on how each decides, firstly, whether 
 to participate in the off-farm labour market and, secondly, on the hours gave out to work away from the 
 family farm. The dataset contains information on all 
 5 The independent Cragg model assumes a (reactions or responses to something/helpful returned information) effect from 
 the level of possible portions to the participation decision (see 
 Atkinson et al., 1984; Haines et al., 1988). 
 
 I. Matshe, T. Young / Farming-based Money flow 30 (2004) 175-186 
 
 people whether they began/tried off-farm work or 
 not. The questions on off-farm labour portion were 
 two-fold: (i) do you work off-farm? and (ii) if so, how 
 much time did you set apart this week for this activity? 
 All members who had non-zero portion of off-farm 
 labour time were then watched/followed working off farm to 
 (check for truth/prove true) their responses. 
 An immediate problem in putting into use the possible model with the sample data is the (not being there; not being present) of reliable information on people' wage rates. As other 
 studies (e.g. Adams, 1991) have shown, there are full of life labour markets in one form or another in (away from cities) 
 areas throughout most of (away from cities) Zimbabwe. However, 
 the local (process of people making, selling, and buying things) in the Shamva District, while offering (many different kinds of people or things) income-creating opportunities, is seen as a relative lack of formal employment 
 and non-money-based payments for labour are common. 
 There is also the difficulty of calculating a shadow 
 wage rate for those people who did not work during the survey period. What's more, there are likely to 
 be measurement errors in recorded wage data due to 
 the unreliability of survey responses this way. In 
 line with other studies (e.g. Benjamin and Guyomard, 
 1994), we choose to include a set of (coming from the outside of something) (numbers that change/things that change), such as individual and household (features/ qualities/ traits), which might affect an person's shadow price 
 of time and the reservation wage rate. 
 An added problem rises because the possible model organized and listed in Section 2 hints that the 
 person's labour decision depends on both his/her 
 attributes and those of the other household member. 
 This possible (detailed description of exactly what is required) is quite easy to represent in scientific analysis of families making up 
 a farmer and a (husband or wife) (see, for example, Benjamin 
 and Guyomard, 1994) but in our dataset there is a 
 variety of household types (farmers with an (person who did not attend class or an event) 
 (husband or wife) or no (husband or wife), families headed by children 
 or young adults, families with a few adults and 
 so forth). It is not clear in this case how the (features/ qualities/ traits) of other household members can be represented 
 in modelling the labour decision of the individual 
 decision-maker. Although we experimented with different approaches,6 it was decided that the empir6 Specifically, including group (numbers that change/things that change) which would show 
 the (features/ qualities/ traits) of other household members (total years of 
 schooling, (male/female status) ratio, etc.) did not improve the overall fit and, in 
 any case, the effects of these (numbers that change/things that change) were hard to understand/explain. 
 
 179 
 
 ical model should leave out/keep out other household members' 
 individual (features/ qualities/ traits), so that the final (detailed description of exactly what is required) incorporated the decision-maker's own attributes 
 (age, (male/female status), education), general household's (features/ qualities/ traits) ((related to a group of people with the same race, culture, religion, etc.) group, numbers in different age 
 groups, etc.) and farm (features/ qualities/ traits) (area planted, 
 importance of cash crops, etc.). 
 All the (numbers that change/things that change) used in this study together with 
 their definitions, means and standard mistakes are 
 presented in Table 1. The (things that change (like test scores) because of other things that you control (like study times)) in the 
 two hurdles of the model are participation (participate) and hours worked off-farm (offhours). The individual (features/ qualities/ traits) included in the analysis are age, 
 (male/female status) and education (level of education). The last thing just mentioned 
 is included to represent workers, which many 
 studies (e.g. Huffman, 1992; de Janvry and Sadoulet, 
 1997) suggest plays an important role in the labour 
 time portion of farming-based families. The household is seen as the (group of people related by culture, race, religion, etc.) of the head 
 of household, the household's (combination of different substances, objects, people, etc.), its productive valuable things and availability of credit, and the level 
 of payments. The farm (features/ qualities/ traits) are the proportion of cash crops grown, the area planted and the 
 farming-based terms of trade. These household and farm 
 (features/ qualities/ traits) feature in some studies of labour 
 supply in developing countries. The dataset is completed with two locational (numbers that change/things that change), which are expected to influence the participation decision:7 the distance from commercial centres and the quality of the 
 (set of machines). 
 A few of the sample means in Table 1 are higher 
 than the similar national averages for areas away from cities in Zimbabwe. This can be explained partly by 
 the much higher farming-based (possible power or ability within/possibility of)  the 
 Shamva District compared to other locations and by 
 the fact that this district has a highly (branched out/done different things) (process of people making, selling, and buying things) thanks to its farming-based (possible greatness or power) and significant 
 mineral wealth. However, since small-scale producers are in pockets of poor and/or (unable to be used or understood) land throughout the whole country (without any concern about/having nothing to do with) 
 agro-(related to the Earth's weather) area, the information about people reflect 
 levels that are just like areas away from cities in general. Mean 
 land area (easy to get to, use, or understand) to the household is close to the 
 national average. The effective area is about 1.9 areas of land

 of transport (set of machines), mainly roads, in stimulating the growth 
 of non-farm employment in Latin America.

 The closeness of the areas of plantable land (easy to get to, use, or understand) 
 to the household in the district to the national average 
 is due to the uniform (treating certain groups of people unfairly) policy (clearly shown/included in the Land Portion Act of 1930) that was 
 behind the (creation and construction/ group of objects) of areas away from cities (native reserves) 
 across the country. In the sample period, a total of 302 
 families gave out some time off farm. This figure 
 includes all those families that began/tried any activity that is mostly for purposes of the production 
 of products (that are bought and sold)  and services for sale and formal and informal 
 employment. 
 All the other (number or thing that changes) means are close to the similar national averages. The wide differences/different versions in 
 education levels, payment income and valuable things reflect 
 the typical unequal distribution of these (numbers that change/things that change) in 
 areas away from cities. The time worked is much higher than one

 would expect. However, it is worth remembering that 
 these data were collected over the 34 busiest weeks of 
 the year. Time worked also falls within the range of 
 results for farming-based labour time portion from a 
 study of small-holders by Massell and Johnson (1968). 
 When one thinks about/believes that during this time of the year 
 it is quite possible that the labour week can be as long 
 as 6 days, these data do not appear silly. 
 
 5. Results 
 The double hurdle model was guessed for all individual adult household members in the sample (1183 
 cases). The choice of explanatory (numbers that change/things that change) to include 
 in each of the two hurdles is filled with problems (Atkinson 
 et al., 1984). As Ghadim et al. (1999) note, "It is 
 usually thought necessary to force some (when something is kept out or not included) 
 restrictions across the two vectors of explanatory vari- 
 
 I. Matshe, T. Young / Farming-based Money flow 30 (2004) 175-186 
 
 ables in order to do enough to identify the limit/guideline 
 guesses. However, explanation almost never allows one to be 
 exact as to which (numbers that change/things that change) should appear in which 
 vector." (p. 9). So the selection is unavoidably somewhat 
 random. The approach taken here is to include in the 
 participation equation all those (related to how much money and power people have) (features/ qualities/ traits) which might decide/figure out preferences towards 
 work and which might proxy the reservation wage. 
 Table 2 presents the results of the joint maximum 
 chance guess8 of the two equations of the independent double hurdle model explaining the chance of participation and hours of off-farm work. A 
 Tobit model version containing the same second stage 
 (numbers that change/things that change) is also presented. On the basis of a chance 
 ratio (LR) test, the restrictions suggested by the Tobit 
 model were rejected (LR = 315.95, with a critical 
 2 value of 30.14). The hint/result/effect of this result is 
 Ï19 
 that participation and hours of work decisions are not 
 based on the same decision-making process. The independent double hurdle is favoured because a LR test 
 of the importance of the covariance term (a³indicates 
 that the independent double hurdle model is appropriate (Ï=0, cannot be rejected on the basis of a LR test 
 statistic of 0.689, against the critical Ï12 value of 3.84). 
 This hints that participation and hours of off-farm 
 work are clear/separate, unrelated decisions. 
 These results clear the choice of a two-stage 
 modelling approach to labour portion, since it is 
 seen/obvious that the effects of the explanatory (numbers that change/things that change) 
 are more complicated than the Tobit moving backward would 
 suggest. This is well illustrated by (thinking about/when one thinks about) the (number or thing that changes) representing the (male/female status) of the individual. The double hurdle results suggest that a female member of the 
 household is less likely to work off farm but if she 
 does decide to begin/try such work, she will work 
 longer hours than her male partner, ceteris paribus. 
 Hence, as the hit/effect of (male/female status) on participation is opposite in direction to that on hours of work, drawing guesses about the effect of (male/female status) on off-farm 
 labour portion from the Tobit or other single equation moving backward would lead to wrong ends/end results. 
 The changeable coefficients presented in Table 2 can 
 be used to establish the high levels of the effects of 
 a change in an explanatory (number or thing that changes) for the particular hurdle. In the participation equation, for example, 
 the (understanding/ explanation) of the changeable coefficients is that

 each one-unit increase in a given (number or thing that changes) leads to an 
 increase in the Probit index9 by standard mistakes 
 equal to the importance of the coefficient. For example, a 1 area of land  increase in the actual area planted leads 
 to a decrease in the Probit index by 0.35917 standard 
 mistakes.10 
 (numbers that change/things that change) for age and educational background are 
 included to take by force/take control of the effect of age, experience and 
 formal training, (features/ qualities/ traits) which may be linked 
 to the shadow wage rate. The quadratic life-cycle effect on off-farm labour time is as expected: at young 
 ages, the hours of work increase with age, but at older 
 ages the hours worked decrease as age increases. In 
 terms of participation, however, the coefficient on age 
 is negative, but unimportant. The quadratic term in 
 age is positive and significant, suggesting for older 
 workers the chance of participation in the off-farm 
 labour market increases with age. This is a somewhat 
 surprising result in terms of much of the books 
 (see, for example, Benjamin and Guyomard, 1994; 
 Abdulai and Delgado, 1999), although Ruben and Van 
 den Berg, 2001), get a almost the same  result for off-farm 
 self-employment in Honduras. As has been found in 
 other studies (e.g. Ferreira and Lanjouw, 2001), the 
 chance of working at off-farm activities is positively and significantly related to the level of education. Specifically, an individual educated beyond 14 
 years is found to be more likely to work off farm. So, 
 the guess that years of formal education make 
 members more employable (for example, because they 
 would be more full of knowledge of employment opportunities and more able to change in the range of tasks that 
 they can (do/complete) as a hired worker or self-employed) 
 is proven true by these results. However, education does 
 not significantly affect the hours worked in off-farm 
 employment. 
 Female adults are less likely to participate in 
 off-farm work. This may not only reflect the greater 
 time promises of women within the household, 
 but also the significant discrimination based on sexes in labour time 
 portion in this area, a result which would be in

 xi are the explanatory (numbers that change/things that change) and Î¦ the standard total 
 (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) with mean zero and variance 1, then xi b is the Probit index. 
 10 In other words, the (understanding/ explanation) of these coefficients needs/demands 
 one to think in the (what people commonly call a/not really a) Z-metric, which is a way of understanding/explaining 
 the changes in standard mistakes.

 Amin and Chipika, 1993; Abdulai and Delgado, 1999). Disaggregation along (male/female status) lines between and within families can

 are an important (thing that decides something) of female participation 
 is given by the negative, significant coefficient on 
 the interaction of (male/female status) and the number of infants 
 in the household: females in families with young 
 children are less likely to work at the off-farm 
 labour market. As noted earlier, when women do participate in the labour market, they work more hours 
 off-farm than their male partners, but again this 
 response is reduced when there are infants in the 
 household. 
 
 I. Matshe, T. Young / Farming-based Money flow 30 (2004) 175-186 
 
 Turning to household (features/ qualities/ traits), the number of 
 adults in the household increases the household's ability (to hold or do something) for (branching out/doing different things) its income-creating activities 
 and so it is unsurprising that the larger the number 
 of adults the greater the chance of an individual 
 adult participating in off-farm work and the longer 
 the hours worked. On the other hand, the presence 
 of children (by itself/in and of itself)  has no significant effect on labour 
 time portion to off-farm work. This finding agrees 
 with results from other studies in areas away from cities in developing countries that raising children and off-farm work 
 are not necessarily competing activities (Sahn and 
 Politician, 1993; Skoufias, 1994). In these (away from cities) communities, members of the extended family take care 
 of children without the parents. However, as 
 we have already seen, the presence of infants does affect the off-farm labour decisions of female adults in 
 the household. 
 The (family and cultural characteristics) of the household head is another 
 household (feature/ quality/ trait) which affects the participation decision. This (number or thing that changes) may 
 influence preferences for off-farm work or may reflect biases in this labour market. Here we find that 
 individual members from families of Zezuru extraction are less likely to participate in off-farm work, 
 opposite to expectations. 
 Unearned income in the form of payments has a 
 negative effect on both the chance of participation 
 and on the hours worked. By (reducing/ slowing/ slowly moving) the restriction 
 on household income, payment income reduces the 
 need to begin/try off-farm work. Productive valuable things, 
 which are mostly farming-based, together with land area, 
 can be seen as proxies for (related to how much money and power people have) group or 
 wealth. Members of families which are (compared to other things) 
 well-off are more likely to participate in off-farm work 
 but when they do, they spend (compared to other things) less time in 
 this activity. The other indicator of (money-related) status in 
 the model, credit availability, is not found to affect the 
 participation decision. 
 The farming system adopted by the household is 
 represented in the model by the proportion of cash 
 crops in the crop mix. As expected this (number or thing that changes) 
 negatively affects participation in off-farm work. This 
 result hints that families who grow cash crops 
 tend to create cash income for market (instances of buying things for money) 
 from this source rather than off-farm work. This result might also reflect the fact that most cash crops 
 grown in this area tend to be labour intensive. This fact, 
 
 183 
 
 joined with the other demands for household labour 
 within the family, increases the reservation wage of 
 this labour. Another farm (feature/ quality/ trait) which has a 
 significant hit/effect on labour decisions is the size of 
 plantable land available to the household: the larger the 
 area the less likely is participation in off-farm work 
 and the less time gave/reserved to it by those who choose 
 to participate. This is agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with farmers difficult project off-farm work because of restrictions in getting 
 access to plantable land, which in turn may lower their 
 reservation wage for such work. 
 Farmers in Shamva are sensitive to relative prices 
 of farm and non-farm products, but only the hours of 
 work decision is significantly affected, (in other words) an increase 
 in the level of farming-based product prices relative to 
 non-farming-based ones leads to less time being gave out 
 off-farm. 
 Although both of the locational (numbers that change/things that change) (representing 
 the quality of the (set of machines) and the distance from 
 commercial markets) have the expected guessed hit/effect on participation, neither is (meaningful numbers). 
 It's true, the measure of (set of machines) quality, a 
 simple dummy (number or thing that changes), is rather (very simple/rough and rude). That distance 
 does not have a more significant effect may reflect 
 the fact that off-farm work has been defined in this 
 study to include all forms of paid employment and 
 that local labour markets offer (good) enough opportunities 
 of employment in one form or another. More than that, as 
 the terms of trade are closely related to distance to 
 the nearest centre, multicollinearity may be influencing the quality of guess of their (pertaining to each person or thing) coefficients. 
 Finally, we may note that the overall fit is 
 acceptable 12 both in terms of R2 (0.37) and the guessed model's (describe the future)ive ability (Table 3). Of the 
 1183 adults in the sample, 559 worked off-farm. 
 The model correctly (describes the future) 466 (83%) of these (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements), while the remaining 93 people were 
 (described the future) not to clear the first hurdle. Of the 624 people in the sample who did not work off-farm, 
 550 people (88%) were correctly (described the future) not to

 6. Discussion 
 The use of the double hurdle approach to modelling 
 labour decisions in this big picture  has been gave a reason for. Not 
 only was the Tobit model formally rejected by the data, 
 but some (numbers that change/things that change), such as productive valuable things, had a 
 different (not numbers-based) as well as (numbers-based) hit/effect at 
 each decision stage. A single equation approach such 
 as the Tobit would have combined these effects and 
 given sneaky and false results. 
 Anyway, the analysis has some faults/problems which should be carried in mind when (thinking about/when one thinks about) the policy effects/results/suggestions discussed below. First, 
 the lack of reliable data on wages prevents using possibly one of the most powerful money-based (numbers that change/things that change) 
 in the model and one of the main (numbers that change/things that change) that is 
 usually/(in the past) a target for policy in this sub-area. It 
 would have been (teaches things) to explore whether their 
 role is important for (away from cities) small-holders in Shamva 
 and whether policy measures to address low wages in 
 these areas are appropriate. 
 Second, this approach completely/in a hinting way assumes uncontrolled 'expenditure of time'. If an individual with the 
 necessary (features/ qualities/ traits) is willing to work, it is thought he or she will work, (in other words) paid work will be found 
 or time will be set apart and given out to an activity that produces 
 products (that are bought and sold)  and services mostly for sale. This is clearly 
 not the case. There are limits as to the availability of 
 
 work and it would have been interesting if these limits could have been included within the model. However, although (numbers that change/things that change) such as the unemployment 
 rate in each place or the density of people/of the group 
 in a particular village or ward could have been built 
 into the model, in a thin slice study these (numbers that change/things that change) 
 would show (compared to other things) little difference/different version and they would 
 only pick up the effect of location. 
 Finally, this analysis ignores some possibly important factors. The riskiness and occasionality 
 of farming-based production (Matshe, 1997), inter-year 
 differences/different versions and seasonal restrictions on grain and cash 
 holdings can have effects/results/suggestions for the amount of time 
 gave out to different activities and for pluriactivity. 
 However, it is hard  or impossible to incorporate 
 these factors in a single season thin slice study. 
 Health (things to carefully think about) also may have influenced the 
 results. At the time of the survey, the mark of shame  attached 
 to HIV/AIDS made it impossible to get meaningful 
 explanations for some (based on what's seen or what seems obvious) (not agreeing/not happening in the same way) (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) (such as no off-farm participation even though 
 the (features/ qualities/ traits) of the household and those of the 
 individual would have suggested otherwise). Another 
 (serious thought/something to think about/respect) to be carried in mind when testing 
 these results is that the survey was managed and did/done during a changing phase of money-based reform, from a 
 heavily (controlled by one central place) money-based system to a more liberal 
 and market-oriented one. Specifically, the government 
 had just stopped the (controlled by one central place) marketing of most 
 grains, had relaxed laws controlling/ruling the mining of small 
 mineral deposits, had shifted most of the management 
 of local people in charge to the local community through 
 elected District Groups of people, had stopped the licensing 
 of farming-based produce marketing and generally was 
 putting into use measures agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with the (related to what holds something together and makes it strong) 
 (change to make better/related to changing something) Programme. 
 6.1. Effects/results/suggestions for (away from cities) development policy 
 Increasing off-farm work in areas away from cities is important because of the potential it has to reduce the 
 effects of low farming-based working well and low farming-based incomes which are related to poorness 
 in areas away from cities. Government policy should be directed 
 not just at farming-based development but to (helping increase/showing in a good way) 
 the (away from cities) (process of people making, selling, and buying things) as a whole. This involves policies 
 directed towards providing (rewards or reasons for doing something) that encourage 
 families to participate in (away from cities) non-farm activities, 
 
 I. Matshe, T. Young / Farming-based Money flow 30 (2004) 175-186 
 
 as well as increasing the ability (to hold or do something) of families to 
 respond to such (rewards or reasons for doing something) (Reardon et al., 2001). In 
 this regard, there is particular scope to (help increase/show in a good way) manufacturing, (the buying and selling of goods) and services which link to the 
 needs of modern farming. 
 Our results suggest that in the Shamva District, the 
 main factors influencing labour portion off farm are 
 land (how easy something is to get to, use, or understand), valuable thing holding, education and (male/female status). The government's current policy of (related to reducing big differences between people) 
 land reform would relieve the land restriction on the 
 portion of labour to farm work and would, according to our results, reduce the (reward or reason for doing something) to participate in 
 the off-farm labour market. This may see household 
 labour being drawn back on to the farm and may discourage (away from cities)-city-based  drift, but without other 
 measures to encourage farming-based development (including technology promotion, improved (workers in general/hiring, training, and firing department), etc.), the hit/effect on (away from cities) household incomes 
 will be quiet/silent/(not having bright colors). 
 (away from cities) families with productive valuable things have the 
 ability to (branch out into different things) into off-farm employment and the 
 higher the level of valuable things the more likely they are to work at these off-farm activities. The government policy of subsidising draught animals through restocking big plans/layouts/dishonest plans (and in some areas actually restocking 
 used up/reduced groups) and the give money tod provision of farming-based tools for rent is this way expected to release 
 some household members for work off farm. On the 
 other hand, our results suggest that increasing household valuable things reduces the amount of time spent off farm. 
 This throws into sharp focus the difficulty of drawing 
 ready ends/end results about the effect on (away from cities) incomes of 
 the (coming from the outside of something) provision of valuable things to (away from cities) families. 
 As the level of education is strongly and positively 
 linked to participation in the off-farm labour market, 
 skill-building and training of (workers in general/hiring, training, and firing department) is an 
 very important aspect of (helping increase/showing in a good way) both farming-based development and (away from cities) off-farm employment. More than that, 
 policies and programmes to help (away from cities) women's 
 access to the off-farm labour market are called for, 
 if the current discrimination based on sex in labour markets is to be 
 reversed.

 a two-stage (double hurdle) process, which tells apart the participation decision and the hours of 
 work decision. This provides a more realistic model of 
 the labour market. Especially, it avoids the ideas (you think are true) that all non-people (who were part of a study, etc.) do not want to work and 
 that the same factors influence the participation and 
 work-time decisions in the same directions. The approach is cleared by the data, with the single equation, Tobit model being clearly rejected, and some 
 (numbers that change/things that change) (e.g. valuable things and (male/female status)) having (not numbers-based) 
 and (numbers-based) different effects on the two labour 
 portion decisions. 
 Our results confirm that education and (male/female status) 
 are important individual (features/ qualities/ traits) deciding/figuring out 
 labour portion off farm. Farm/household (features/ qualities/ traits) (the number of adults in the household, the 
 level of payments, the area (easy to get to, use, or understand) to the household and its level of valuable thing-holding) are also significant 
 factors in off-farm work time portion. In the study 
 area, off-farm work is stimulated at least in part by the 
 inability of household to increase farming-based output 
 and therefore farming-based income. 
 Given the importance of non-farm income in reducing the problems of low farming-based working well, 
 poorness and food (state of not being safe/source of mental worry), policies should be directed towards providing (rewards or reasons for doing something) to families 
 to participate in (away from cities) non-farm activities, as well as 
 increasing their ability to take advantage of such 
 opportunities. This would involve an approach in which 
 the (away from cities) (process of people making, selling, and buying things) is viewed as a whole, so that, in 
 addition to policies aimed at farming-based development, manufactures, (the buying and selling of goods) and services very important 
 for modern farming are also (helped increase/showed in a good way).
