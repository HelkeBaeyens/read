 ABSTRACT 
 Lerman, Z. and Parliament, C., 1991. Size and industry effects m the performance of 
 farming-based cooperatives. Agric. Econ., 6: 15-29. 
 The goal of this study is to decide/figure out if there are important size and industry effects 
 on (money-related) performance of farming-based cooperatives. The performance of 43 dairy, food, 
 grain, and farm supply cooperatives in the U.S. was carefully studied over the period 1970-1987 
 using (money-related) ratios came/coming from accounting data. The analysis showed/told about significant size 
 and industry effects. Large (related to a large area) cooperatives are (producing more with less waste) in using their valuable things 
 to create sales, while small (related to a large area) cooperatives have higher a money-making state. The findings 
 suggest that the focus on growth may not always produce helpful results among 
 farming-based cooperatives. Among the four businesses studied, the dairy (related to a large area) cooperatives 
 appear to be the strongest performers, while the food marketing cooperatives are seen as the lowest performance measures. Since both dairy and food cooperatives work at 
 value-added processing, this difference in performance makes it hard to reach clear 
 ends/end results about possible advantages of disadvantages or up-and-down (combination of different things together that work as one unit) relative to 
 traditional cooperative activities. Trend analysis points to/shows that the money-making ability of the 
 farming-based cooperatives in all industry and size categories (lowered in number/got worse/gotten worse) in response to the 
 downturn in U.S. farming after 1980. While the decline in a money-making state was at almost the same 
 rates for both large and small cooperatives, the difference/different version of (wasting very little while working or producing something) and power was in 
 opposite directions. Large cooperatives may be expected to continue improving their valuable thing 
 use without relative improvement in a money-making state, and increasing the level of their 
 (money owed)  in relation to equity.

 INTRODUCTION 
 
 Performance test of cooperatives has always been a topic of 
 a lot of interest in farming-based money flow/money-based studies, mostly because of the 
 importance of the cooperative form of organization in farming in both 
 developed and developing countries. Usually/(in the past), farming-based cooperatives have been encouraged as a vehicle for money-based development, because the cooperative form of organization, in addition to being fair, 
 enables small producers to take by force/take control of (processes of people making, selling, and buying things) of size and increases their 
 marketing power. Governments jn both developed and developing countries actively (help increase/show in a good way) and help farming-based cooperatives. Reason of 
 continued public support of the cooperative form of organization needs/demands 
 test and watching of cooperative performance. 
 The goal of this study is to decide/figure out if there are significant size 
 and industry effects on performance among cooperatives. Size effects, if 
 detected, may help to decide/figure out whether cooperatives should focus on 
 growth, as has been obvious in the constant state of mergers among U.S. 
 cooperatives. Industry effects, if found, may point to/show whether the cooperative form of organization is more successful in the usual businesses of 
 input supply and raw produce marketing than in the (up and down) integrated 
 businesses that include valued-added processing. The industry results may 
 provide some (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) to resolve the conflict between cooperative planners focusing on traditional service activities and those (trying to get people to believe in and agree with something) a shift 
 toward value-added processing. 
 The next section describes the data and the way(s) of doing things. The two 
 sections that follow present the results on size and industry effects. Ends/end results and policy effects/results/suggestions are given in the last section. 
 DATA AND METHODOLOGY 
 
 (money-related) money-flow experts generally agree that (person or business who gives money to help start a business)-owned firms may be 
 viewed as value-(make as big as possible)rs and their performance can be measured by 
 a money-making state (changed to make better/changed to fit new conditions) for risk. The unemotional function of cooperatives is 
 much less clearly defined, however, especially because the cooperative 
 exists in order to provide a service to its members and the benefits of the 
 cooperative form of organization are not restricted to earning a return on 
 investment. As a result, there is a lack of accepted measures of cooperative 
 performance. 
 The present research partially overcomes this difficulty by putting into use a 
 multidimensional approach. Four measures of business performance of 
 cooperatives are examined: power, (wasting very little while working or producing something), liquidity, and a money-making state. 
 Performance is carefully studied by (money-related) ratios based on reported accounting

 The before-tax rate of return on equity is used because some cooperatives do not report 
 taxes in their income statement due to the possible hit/effect of (the money, and other help, given to a person or organization) refund policies on 
 tax (responsibility/duty). Eight cooperatives in the sample do not report (money made/good thing received) or net margins in 
 their (money-related) statements. For these cooperatives (all in the food industry), the (money made/good thing received) was 
 guessed using the way of doing things developed in Lerman and Parliament (1990a). 
 
 data, a standard way of doing things borrowed from (person or business who gives money to help start a business)-owned firms for (money-related) performance test of cooperatives (Babb and Lang, 1985; Chen et 
 al., 1985; Schrader et al., 1985; Parliament et al., 1990). These performance 
 measures focus on the cooperative as a business firm and do not capture 
 possible added/more benefits to members. Yet (money-related) ratios reflect the 
 effect of (related to a plan to reach a goal) decisions and should show if differences exist among 
 cooperatives in different size and industry categories. 
 Table 1 presents the definitions of the four (money-related) ratios used in this 
 research. These particular (money-related) ratios were chosen because of their 
 direct link to (related to big business) plan and goals. The relevance of these 
 (money-related) ratios for measuring the performance of cooperatives is discussed 
 by Parliament et al. (1990), who also review some different measures of 
 cooperative performance that focus on benefits to members. 
 The information file for this research consists of the audited once-a-year reports of a 
 sample of 43 U.S. (related to a large area) cooperatives for the period 1970-1987. The 
 data were collected by writing to over 200 non-(related to arriving at an agreement) cooperatives 
 listed in the Directory of Farmer Cooperatives of the USDA Farming-based 
 Cooperative Service (ACS) (Jermolowicz and Kennedy, 1989). The sample 
 includes all the people who responded that gave their once-a-year reports by the end 
 of 1989. These are mainly (related to a large area) cooperatives, almost the same  in sales volume 
 (features/ qualities/ traits) to the top 100 U.S. cooperatives regularly surveyed by ACS.

 The 43 (related to a large area) cooperatives were classified into four businesses: 12 dairy 
 cooperatives, 12 supply cooperatives, 14 food marketing and processing 
 cooperatives, and five grain and cotton marketing cooperatives. 1 The 
 cooperatives were also classified into two size categories, 'small' and 
 'large', by their total valuable things. The range of mean total valuable things of the cooperatives in the sample was from $3 million to $911 million (averaged over the 
 sample period). The distribution of mean valuable thing size for the cooperatives is 
 shown in Fig. 1. For purposes of size analysis, 29 cooperatives with mean 
 total valuable things up to $125 million were classified as 'small' and 14 cooperatives 
 with mean total valuable things of over $125 million were classified as 'large'. The 
 size classification dividing line was identified by an (related to things clustering together) group-related 
 analysis of the cooperatives by mean valuable thing size. Figure 2 presents the 
 distribution of the 43 cooperatives by industry and by size within each 
 industry. 
 
 1 There was initial doubt as to the proper classification of grain and cotton cooperatives in the sample. Because grain marketing cooperatives also sell farm inputs to their 
 members, it could be argued that they should be classified as supply cooperatives. Because 
 cotton cooperatives operate on a combining basis, it could be argued that they should be 
 classified with the combining food cooperatives. The doubt was settled by applying 
 multivariate discriminant analysis, which pointed to/showed that grain marketing cooperatives were 
 clear/separate from the supply cooperatives and furthermore could be combined with the cotton 
 cooperatives into one category. Discriminant analysis also established tha:t cotton cooperatives could not be classified with food cooperatives. It was this way decided to classify the grain 
 and cotton marketing cooperatives as a separate, although (in a true way) small, category.

 The (money-related) ratios of all the cooperatives were calculated from their 
 audited once-a-year reports for each year during the period 1970-1987. The 
 time-series data were used to trace the behavior of cooperatives in different categories over time. For each (instance of watching, noticing, or making a statement) year, the middle-point of each of 
 the four (money-related) ratios was calculated separately in each industry and size 
 category. In this way, a time series of 18 middle-point (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) was gotten 
 for each (money-related) ratio by industry and size categories. The middle-point was 
 chosen as the descriptive statistic because it is more strong to (things that aren't part of the main group) than 
 the mean, and examination of the data showed/told about occasional (things that aren't part of the main group). 
 The 1970-1987 time series of the middle-point (money-related) ratios were carefully studied 
 using the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test ("one-way analysis of variance 
 by ranks") in order to detect a big differences among industry and 
 size categories (Daniel, 1978). In application to the two size categories, the 
 Kruskal-Wallis test happens with the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The test 
 ranks the combined middle-point (money-related) ratios in different categories and forms 
 the sums of the ranks for the combined sample. If the rank sums, or the 
 
 20 
 
 Z. LERMAN AND C. PARLIAMENT 
 
 average scores, are (good or well enough) different among the categories, the test 
 rejects the null guess that the middle-point (money-related) ratios are the same 
 across categories and establishes that, with a certain chance, the 
 industry or size categories have different middle-point (money-related) ratios. The 
 average rank scores in each category can be used to rank performance. The 
 performance ranking of the different categories over the 1970-1987 period 
 received/got in this way was (checked for truth/proved true) by Page's nonparametric test for ordered 
 other choices (Daniel, 1978). Since the Page test results confirm and reinforce the Kruskal-Wallis test results, only the last thing just mentioned are reported in full. 
 In addition to tests of the performance ranking of categories, linear 
 moving backward analysis of the middle-point time series was used to identify differences in (money-related) ratio (popular things/general ways things are going) by size and industry and to (describe the future) possible 
 future changes in the performance rankings watched/followed for the period 19701987. Trends were figured out by/decided by running ordinary least-squares (moving backwards) for each middle-point ratio on time with dummy (numbers that change/things that change) for size and 
 industry. The large cooperatives were the base for guess of moving backward 
 coefficients with size dummy (numbers that change/things that change), and the dairy category was the base 
 for moving backward coefficient guess with industry dummy (numbers that change/things that change). Two 
 groups of tests were (did/done/completed) on the guessed moving backward coefficients: (a) 
 evenness-of-slopes tests for a big difference of the guessed 
 limits/guidelines between the base category and other categories, and (b) multivariate tests for a big difference from zero of the guessed limits/guidelines going along with/matching up to different size and industry categories. 
 SIZE EFFECTS 
 
 Said size effects were watched/followed between large and small cooperatives over the period 1970-1987. The Kruskal-Wallis test results presented 
 in Table 2 show that three of the four ratios (a money-making state, liquidity, and

 (wasting very little while working or producing something)) were very different between the large and small cooperatives at the 5% level of importance. The middle-point (wasting very little while working or producing something) of valuable thing 
 use was much higher for the large cooperatives, while the 
 middle-point liquidity and a money-making state measures were much higher for the 
 small cooperatives. Only the middle-point power was not found to be very different between the two size categories. 
 To illustrate the breaking up/spreading out of the ratio values in each year, the top and 
 bottom (25% and 75%) quartiles of the (money-related) ratios were calculated for 
 each year for the large and the small cooperatives. The interquartile range 
 traces a band around the middle-point that contains 50% of the watched/followed ratio 
 values in the sample of cooperatives for each particular year (this band is 
 not necessarily matching about the middle-point). The interquartile range is a 
 nonparametric measure of breaking up/spreading out the same as standard moving away. 
 Examination of the interquartile range of the two size categories over time 
 provides a visual confirmation of the Kruskal-Wallis test results presented 
 in Table 2. 
 Figure 3 (panels a to d) places (on top of) the interquartile range of small 
 and large cooperatives for each ratio. Panel a shows that the interquartile 
 range of the leverage ratio for the large cooperatives lies almost completely 
 within the interquartile range for the small cooperatives over the period 
 1970-1987. The overlapping interquartile ranges point to/show that the middle-point 
 power is not very different for the small and the large cooperatives. 
 In panel b, the interquartile range of the (wasting very little while working or producing something) ratio for the large 
 cooperatives lies within the interquartile range for the small cooperatives 
 until about 1979, after which the top quartile value of the large cooperatives is regularly higher than the top quartile value of the small cooperatives. The graphical presentation shows/tells about that the difference between large 
 and small cooperatives became more obvious over the later period 
 1979-1987. Large cooperatives this way appear to be (producing more with less waste) than the 
 small cooperatives in using their valuable things to create sales. 
 In panel c, the top quartile of the liquidity ratio for the small cooperatives regularly lies above the top quartile for the large cooperatives, 
 while the bottom quartiles roughly overlap. This points to/shows that the small 
 cooperatives maintain a higher liquidity than the large cooperatives. 
 Panel d presents the interquartile range of the money-making ability ratio. The 
 top 25% of the rate of return on equity (RoE) for the small cooperatives lies above the upper ROE quartile for the large cooperatives in 17 out 
 of 18 years, and the bottom quartile of the small cooperatives lies above the 
 bottom quartile of the large cooperatives in 14 out of the 18 years. The ROE 
 for the small cooperatives is this way watched/followed to be higher over most of the 
 sample period than for the large cooperatives.

 (popular thing/general way things are going) analysis results for the middle-point (money-related) ratios of the large and the 
 small cooperatives are presented in Table 3. The middle-point leverage ratio 
 shows very different (popular things/general ways things are going) for the two size categories, increasing 
 over time for the large cooperatives and (lowering in number/getting worse) for the small cooperatives. If this difference continues, large cooperatives may develop in the 
 future much higher levels of (money owed)  relative to equity than the small 
 cooperatives, opposite to the pattern watched/followed between 1970 and 1987 (Fig. 
 3a). The middle-point (wasting very little while working or producing something) of the large cooperatives increases over time, 
 while that of the small cooperatives declines, which should only strengthen 
 in the future the advantage that large cooperatives had between 1970 and 
 1987 in using their valuable things to create sales (Fig. 3b). Both a money-making state 
 and liquidity show/tell about a (lowering in number/getting worse) (popular thing/general way things are going), but the rate of decline is not 
 very different for the large and the small cooperatives, which 
 hints that the advantage in a money-making state and liquidity watched/followed for the 
 small cooperatives between 1970 and 1987 may be maintained in the 
 future. 
 So, while the large cooperatives are watched/followed to be (producing more with less waste) in 
 using their valuable things to create sales, the small cooperatives have higher 
 a money-making state and liquidity. The results suggest that large cooperatives may 
 enjoy scale (processes of people making, selling, and buying things) in terms of (wasting very little while working or producing something), but the benefits of size do not 
 necessarily translate into higher a money-making state. The higher rate of return on 
 equity for the small cooperatives is agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with the "small-firm effect" 
 watched/followed for (person or business who gives money to help start a business) owned corporations, which shows that (people or businesss who give money to help start businesses) in 
 small firms usually earn higher rates of return on investment [see Levy and 
 Lerman (1985) and references (in there/within that)]. With respect to liquidity, it could 
 be guessed that small firms, with a (compared to other things) small valuable thing base, prefer 
 to maintain a higher liquidity buffer than large, valuable thing-rich firms. With 
 respect to take advantage of, it could (in almost the same way) be argued that small cooperatives 
 would have a lower power than the large, more secure cooperatives.

 PERFORMANCE OF AGRICULTURAL COOPERATIVES 
 
 differences in capital structure between small and large cooperatives, the 
 trend analysis results support an expectation of higher power for the 
 large cooperatives. 
 INDUSTRY EFFECTS 
 
 Clear industry effects were found for all middle-point (money-related) ratios. The 
 Kruskal-Wallis test results (Table 4) show that for leverage, (wasting very little while working or producing something), and 
 liquidity the industry effects were significant at 1%. The (related to studying numbers) test 
 results are visually proven true by the time series graphs in Fig. 4 (panels a 
 to d). The graphs in Fig. 4 plot only the middle-point ratios by industry over the 
 period 1970-1987, as it was not doable to place (on top of) the interquartile ranges for the four businesses. 
 The leverage ratio (panel a) was found to be the highest for the food 
 marketing cooperatives and the lowest for the supply cooperatives, with the 
 dairy and grain cooperatives lying in the middle. 
 The four businesses are also clearly (made different) by (wasting very little while working or producing something) (panel b). 
 Dairies regularly have thee highest (wasting very little while working or producing something), followed by grain and 
 supply cooperatives in this order, with the food marketing cooperatives 
 regularly at the bottom of the ranking. 
 Liquidity is the highest for dairy and supply cooperatives, which both 
 have (compared to other things) high quick ratios near the level of 1.0 (panel c), while food 
 and grain cooperatives have (compared to other things) low quick ratios around 0.5. The 
 Kruskal-Wallis test points to/shows that only the differences between the food 
 and grain cooperatives are not significant. 
 The differences in a money-making state between dairy, food, and grain cooperatives are not (meaningful numbers). Yet the middle-point ROE of the cooperatives in these three businesses combined is much higher than that of

 the supply cooperatives (at 5% level of importance by the Kruskal-Wallis 
 test). 
 The (popular things/general ways things are going) of the middle-point (money-related) ratios by industry are presented in 
 Table 5. The middle-point (money owed)  to equity ratios of the cooperatives in the four 
 businesses show a coming together (popular thing/general way things are going), mainly as a result of the declining 
 power of the dairy and food cooperatives and the increasing power of 
 the supply cooperatives (compare Fig. 4a). It might be guessed that the 
 highly (including a lot of debt) food and dairy cooperatives got good things from wearing away of 
 their fixed-rate (money owed)  in the inflationary period 1973-1980: their equity 
 part may have increased through unrealized (when things become more valuable), driving 
 the leverage ratio down over time. The middle-point sales to valuable things ratio of the 
 dairy, food, and supply cooperatives does not show a significant (popular thing/general way things are going) over 
 time, and the relative (wasting very little while working or producing something) ranking of these businesses will probably be 
 maintained in the future (Fig. 4b). The grain cooperatives show a big improvement of their sales to valuable things ratio, and as a result may 
 challenge in the future the top ranking dairy cooperatives. The rate of 
 return on equity (RoE) shows/tells about a significant (lowering in number/getting worse) (popular thing/general way things are going) for cooperatives 
 in three of the four businesses; only the guessed coefficient of the food 
 cooperatives, while negative, is not very different from zero. The 
 guessed decline in middle-point ROE may be due to the general downturn in 
 the U.S. farming-based part/area during the 1980s, as separate analysis using only 
 the 1970-1979 data did not show/tell about significant downward (popular things/general ways things are going) in a money-making state during the pre-1980 ten years for three out of the four businesses 
 (except the grain cooperatives). 
 In summary, on a innocent multiobjective scale that assigns equal weights to 
 the four ratios (Table 6), the dairy cooperatives appear to be the strongest 
 performers among the four businesses, ranking first in (wasting very little while working or producing something) and 
 liquidity and second in leverqge and a money-making state. The food marketing 
 cooperatives are the weakest performers, ranking lowest in leverage, effi-

 ciency, and liquidity. The supply and grain cooperatives are in the middle 
 of the ranking. 
 CONCLUSION 
 
 One of the (constant/not going away) (popular things/general ways things are going) among cooperatives is growth through 
 mergers and purchases. The findings of this study point to/show that although 
 larger cooperatives improve (wasting very little while working or producing something) through (making a lot of an item so each item costs less), the 
 higher (wasting very little while working or producing something) of valuable thing use does not translate into higher a money-making state. This hints that the benefits of mergers may be put way too much focus on, 
 which is agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with recent findings pointing to/showing that the money-making ability of 
 cooperatives does not very much improve after a merger (Parliament and 
 Taitt, 1989). 
 The industry effects showed in this study do not provide definite 
 (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) to support either side of the (related to a plan to reach a goal) conflict between the 
 fighters (for something) of traditional service activities and the fighters (for something) of (getting involved with different types of things; not sticking with only one thing) through value-added processing. The dairy cooperatives, which engage 
 in value-added processing, are the highest ranking performers among the 
 four businesses by leverage, (wasting very little while working or producing something), liquidity, and a money-making state ratios. The 
 food cooperatives, on the other hand, are at the bottom of the ranking, 
 although they also work at long/big value-added processing. 
 The grain and supply cooperatives, which have generally limited their 
 activities to the usual areas of raw produce marketing and input 
 buying, show a higher performance ranking than the food cooperatives 
 working at value-added processing. It could be argued that the (compared to other things) 
 strong performance of the dairy cooperatives in the U.S. is related to 
 government (promised that something will definitely happen or that something will definitely work as described) prices for the take from used in dairy products. If this is 
 
 28 
 
 Z. LERMAN AND C. PARLIAMENT 
 
 in fact so, the inferior performance of the food processing cooperatives 
 may be understood/explained as agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with the view that, without 
 clearly stated/particular support programs for value-added processing, cooperatives should 
 think about/believe restricting their scope to traditional activities. 
 In a recent comparison of cooperatives and (person or business who gives money to help start a business)-owned firms (Lerman and Parliament, 1990b), the food cooperatives were found to have a 
 weaker performance than the (person or business who gives money to help start a business)-owned firms in the same industry by 
 three of the six performance measures thought about/believed while the dairy cooperatives (did/done/completed) not worse than the (person or business who gives money to help start a business)-owned dairies by all measures. 
 These findings point to/show that the (compared to other things) weak performance of the food 
 cooperatives watched/followed in the present study cannot be completely attributed to 
 industry-clearly stated/particular factors. There are indications that, of the two value-added 
 processing businesses, the dairy cooperatives have a higher proportion of 
 pass-through sales than the food-processing cooperatives: the proportion of 
 fluid milk sales in dairies is higher than the proportion of raw produce 
 sales in food-processing cooperatives. These factors also could be understood/explained as supporting the view that (act of something getting bigger, wider, etc.) into value-added processing 
 has not been a total success for cooperatives. 
 An international comparison is given by a recent study of two 
 (related to a large area) farming-based cooperatives in Israel (Yacobi, 1989), where the cooperative working at value-added food processing had much higher 
 power, lower a money-making state, and lower (wasting very little while working or producing something) than the cooperative that 
 limited its activities to raw produce marketing. The Israeli comparison, however limited, appears to support those who believe that manufacturing of 
 value-added person products may not be a especially good 
 activity for cooperatives, (even though there is the existence of) the attraction of forward (combination of different things together that work as one unit). Cooperatives may find it hard to get the necessary useful things/valuable supplies for successful 
 penetration of the personal food markets. 
 Support programs, product mix, and market (features/ qualities/ traits) are (in the end) responsible for success or failure of value-added processing. Further 
 research is needed in order to identify and separate the government 
 support part in the performance of U.S. dairy cooperatives and to 
 carefully study the cooperatives in the two valued-added processing businesses on 
 the basis of the clearly stated/particular mix of pass-through sales and value-added products. More described/explained comparisons between cooperatives and (person or business who gives money to help start a business)-owned 
 firms in corresponding businesses are needed in order to separate between 
 industry-specific and cooperative-clearly stated/particular factors. This added/more research 
 may produce more definite results (related to/looking at/thinking about) the debate between supporters of traditional cooperatives and fights (for something) of up-and-down (combination of different things together that work as one unit). At 
 this stage, the striking difference in performance between the two valueadded processing businesses in our sample makes it hard to generalize 
 about the relative good qualities of value-added processing for cooperatives.
