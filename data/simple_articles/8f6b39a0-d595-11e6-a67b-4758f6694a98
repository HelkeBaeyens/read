 Abstract 
 The 1998 flood in Bangladesh caused a shortfall of 2.2 million tonnes (mill.t) in the rice production and threatened the 
 food security of tens of millions of families. (even though there is the existence of) the best efforts of (people who give money or other things) and the government, the public distribution 
 ofrice and wheat was only 188,000t more than (at first/before other things happened) planned for July 1998 to April1999. 
 However, a major food problem was turned-away as private imports, made possible by trade liberalisation in the early 1990s, 
 stabilised market prices and supplies. The government's direct distribution programs, though small compared to private 
 imports, anyway increased access to food by poor families. Household survey data point to/show that immediate relief 
 efforts were well targeted to flood-affected families, as were moves (from one place to another) from NGOs. (able to be hurt) Group Feeding (VGF), a 
 medium-term program, was not targeted well to families directly exposed to the flood, though the program was (compared to other things) 
 well targeted to poor families. 
 More broadly, the Bangladesh experience with the 1998 flood shows that in a liberalised trade government, where private imports 
 respond to price signals, food aid's (thing that's given/work that's done) to the total availability of food may be (almost nothing/very little). However, foreign help 
 in kind or in cash, can provide useful things/valuable supplies for give money tod, targeted distribution to food-insecure families - help not 
 possible otherwise under tight government budget restrictions. Â© 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

 1. Introduction 
 The 1998 flood, dubbed 'the flood of the century' 
 in Bangladesh, covered 51% of the country at its peak, 
 caused a shortfall of 2.2 million tonnes (mill.t) in rice 
 production and threatened the food security of tens 
 of millions of families. Government appeals for 
 help in August 1998 created promises of 
 1.083 mill.t of food aid for flood relief and healing/fixing from (people who give money or other things), providing the food grain for an

 (act of something getting bigger, wider, etc.) of targeted public distribution. (even though there is the existence of) the 
 best efforts of (people who give money or other things) and government, the public distribution of rice and wheat was only 188,000t more 
 than (at first/before other things happened) planned for July 1998 to April 1999. 
 Anyway, a major food problem was turned-away. This paper explores how. 
 Unfortunately, food (not enough of something) and hungers are not 
 new to Bangladesh. The great Bengal hunger of 1943 
 killed about three million people in what is now 
 Bangladesh and eastern India (Dreze and Sen, 1989). 
 Drought-related crop failures and a shortage offoreign 
 exchange for impmis resulted in high rice prices and 
 food shortages that added/gave to a sharp increase 
 in death in 1974 (Ravallion, 1990). Major floods

 in 1987 and 1988, though not leading to a hunger, 
 added/gave to crop shortages and sharp increases in 
 rice prices, lessened by a large increase in public food 
 grain distribution. 
 However, supply (or availability) of food is not the 
 only (thing that decides something) of food security. Food (government money) 
 of families (their legal means and useful things/valuable supplies to get food: own production, other income, public and 
 private moves (from one place to another), and borrowing) decide/figure out their access to food (Sen, 1982). 1 As is described below, the 
 availability of food grains in Bangladesh following the 
 floods of 1998 was maintained mainly through private 
 part/area imports, made possible by trade liberalisation 
 in the early 1990s. Government and NGO programs 
 added/gave mainly by increasing access to food by the 
 poor. 
 Section 2 begins with a review of the food grain 
 (process of people making, selling, and buying things) of Bangladesh and major changes in government food policy in the 1990s. The effects of the 
 1998 flood on the domestic production and the role of 
 public and (people and businesses that are not part of the government) imports in increasing the 
 supply and stabilising the prices are then discussed. 
 Section 3 focuses on the household access to food, 
 presenting data from a survey of (away from cities) families in 
 flood-affected areas. The analysis focuses on the (wasting very little while working or producing something) of targeting of government programs and the 
 relative (thing that's given/work that's done) of the public, NGO and private 
 moves (from one place to another) in increasing the household access to food. 
 Section 4 ends/decides the discussion. 
 
 2. Food availability after the flood 
 
 Group food availability in Bangladesh is low, 
 even in years of good harvests. In 1996-1997, 
 the latest year of good harvests, total calorie consumption was only 2085 cal per person per 
 day, 72.8% from rice and 9.2% from wheat (FAO 
 Food Balance Sheet, 1997). Three crops of rice 
 are (helped to grow) in Bangladesh: aman, usually transplanted during the bad rainstorms in June-July and collected in November-December; boro, transplanted in 
 December-January and collected in May-June; and 
 1 In fact, the great Bengal hunger was not caused by a crop 
 failure, but was mostly due to an increase in city-based  demand for 
 food during a war-time money-based boom that raised food prices for 
 the (away from cities) poor (Dreze and Sen, 1989). 
 
 aus, often directly spread around in March-April and collected 
 in July-August. Before the 1998 flood, aman and 
 boro rice production in the July 1998 to June 1999 
 money-related year were expected to be 9.5 and 7.8 mill.t, 49 
 and 41%, (match up each pair of items in order), of expected total production 
 of 19.2 mill.t. Due to the adoption of green revolution 
 technology, (including improved seeds, crop-watering/rinsing with water of 
 boro rice in the dry season and fertiliser), rice production has increased quickly, especially since the late 
 1980s, and the country is nearly independent in rice. 
 In the 1990s, rice imports averaged only 686,000 t 
 per year, 4.0% of net rice availability and 3.5% of net 
 food grain availability. Wheat imports (about 64.3% 
 in the form of food aid) averaged 52.9 and 7.7% of 
 net wheat and food grain availability, (match up each pair of items in order) 
 (see Ahmed et al., 2000). 
 Before the April 1994, the liberalisation of (people and businesses that are not part of the government) rice imports (and the 1992liberalisation of 
 (people and businesses that are not part of the government) wheat imports), shortfalls in food grain 
 production were met through food aid, government 
 commercial imports and draw down of public stocks. 
 However, since 1994 the (people and businesses that are not part of the government) imports of rice, 
 mainly from India (which liberalised its (people and businesses that are not part of the government) rice exports in late 1994), have added to the domestic supplies in years of below-average harvests in 
 Bangladesh. So, the import equality price of rice from 
 Indian markets has given a ceiling on rice prices 
 in Bangladesh (Fig. 1). 2 
 The market prices of rice had been high in the first 
 half of 1998, even before the flood, because of a poor 
 1997-1998 aman rice harvest in November/December 
 1997. As domestic prices rose, beginning in December 1997, it became money-making for the (people and businesses that are not part of the government) 
 to import rice from India (mainly by truck and rail 
 across the land borders). Government policy encouraged (people and businesses that are not part of the government) imports of rice by removing the taxes/import taxes on imports, limiting the open market sales, giving 
 instructions to hurry the clearance of rice imports 
 through customs and stopping from the re-(something forced on people/an inconvenient situation) 
 of anti-collecting laws. An excellent boro rice harvest 
 in the mid-1998, brought a (lasting for a short time) (a) break from 
 high prices of rice in Bangladesh, but the prices soon 
 rose again to import equality levels as the flood waters slowly spread across the country from mid-July 
 1998 to early-September 1998. Initial flood damage to

 the standing aus crop was small (only 280,000 t), but 
 the flood also destroyed seedlings for the following 
 November's aman rice crop, (in the end) leading to a 
 1.76 mill.t aman crop loss (Table 1). However, private 
 part/area imports went beyond 200,000 t of rice per month 
 from August 1998 to April1999, totalling 2.377 mill.t 
 over this period, more than offsetting the guessed 
 total rice production shortfall of 2.2 mill.t. 3 
 In comparison to the (people and businesses that are not part of the government) rice and wheat 
 imports, public distribution of food grain was (compared to other things) small, due to (compared to other things) low wheat stock levels at the time of the flood, uncertainties (related to/looking at/thinking about) 
 food aid (things reaching their destinations), problems with government purchase of rice in (stores around the world) and a perceived 
 need to maintain (good) enough stocks to help stabilise markets in the event of possible extreme (for only a short time) shortages. 4 Although rice distribution was greater than 
 3 Comparisons of guessed rice demand with total rice availability and comparisons of Bangladesh and Indian data on the volume 
 of rice trade between the two countries suggest that the volume 
 of private imports for the April 1998-March 1999 period may 
 have been overstated by as much as 1.0 mill.t (out of an official 
 Government of Bangladesh total of 3.2 mill.t). See Dorosh (2001) 
 and Del Ninno et al. (2001). 
 4 Dorosh (2001) and Del Ninno et a!. (2001) give further details 
 of government food policy following the flood. 
 
 (at first/before other things happened) planned in the months immediately following the flood (July-September), rice distribution was 
 cut back once the food aid wheat became available, 
 partly because international purchase through open 
 tenders did not get the desired amounts. (in the end), only 399,000 t of rice was distributed from 
 July 1998 to April1999, 333,000t less than (at first/before other things happened) 
 programmed in the pre-flood distribution plan. Private 
 part/area rice imports, equal to 2.42 mill.t in this period 
 (using official Government of Bangladesh (GOB) figures), were this way 6.1 times larger than government rice 
 distribution. 5 
 Increased inflows of food aid did enable a large 
 increase in the public distribution of wheat from 
 905,000t to an (happening sometime in the future)  1.603 mill.t for the whole 
 July 1998 to June 1999 money-related year, but in November 1998 wheat distribution was limited by the slow 
 (the act of reaching a destination) of food aid and low government stocks. The 
 big part of public distribution of food grain during 
 and after the flood was not one of increasing total 
 supplies but rather one of targeting relief to those 
 in need. 
 5 Using a lower guess of 1.42 rnill.t (1.0 rnill.t less than GOB 
 official figures), (people and businesses that are not part of the government) rice imports were still 3.5 times 
 larger than government rice distribution.

 3. Household access to food: public distribution 
 and other moves (from one place to another) 
 Two major channels ruled government food 
 relief efforts following the flood: unnecessary relief 
 (GR), designed to provide emergency relief to disaster victims; and (able to be hurt) group feeding (VGF), 
 aimed at helping the families over a longer period 
 ((in the end), from September 1998 to April 1999). 6 
 Immediate (for only a short time) relief through GR was targeted 
 by location. In contrast, the VGF program included all 
 the areas of the country (both flooded and non-flood 
 affected areas), and was (related to managers) targeted 
 to poor families through selection by local (groups that decide or promote things) (Del Ninno and Roy, 1999a). However, the 
 sizes of these programs were limited, both by the 
 available wheat stocks (up to early November when 
 the government commercial imports and food aid (things reaching their destinations) added to government stocks) and the (money-related) 
 cost of the programs (covered mostly by 
 food aid). 
 Major flood relief efforts began with the provision 
 of 20,400 t of rice through GR in the flood-affected 
 thanas in August 1998 and an added 30,800 t 
 of rice in September. Also, the VGF program 
 began on a large scale in August with an initial 
 distribution of 1.3 million cards, each entitling the 
 holder to 8 kg of rice per month. During August 
 and September, a total of 27,500 t of rice were distributed through this program. At 8 kg per card, an 
 guessed 1.35 and 2.13 million families received 
 the VGF (gives out portions) in August and September, (match up each pair of items in order). Almost no wheat was distributed through relief channels in the first months of the flood. At 
 the asking of the World Food Programme (WFP), 
 the GOB expanded the VGF program to 4 million 
 cards with an portion of 16 kg of grain per card, 
 half rice and half wheat in October, and all wheat 
 after that. 
 Data from a survey of 757 families conducted 
 in November-December 1998 (about 2.5 months after 
 the floodwaters had moved back) in seven flood-affected 
 thanas were used to provide (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) of the extent to

 in December 1998, following the aman rice harvest, when soils 
 were dry enough to permit manual earthwork in the building of 
 roads and water channels.

 which the GRand VGF programs were well targeted. 7 
 As shown in Table 2, average per person monthly expenses during the period of 15 July to 14 November 1998 were only 755.2 Taka (US$_$ 15.64 at the 
 November 1998 exchange rate of 48.3 Taka per US$_$). 
 Sixty-eight percent of all the families, and 85.5% 
 of the families in the lowest per person expense 
 quintile, owned less than 0.5 areas of land (0.20 ha) of land. 
 A total of 67.1% of the families in the first 
 quintile received some type of government move (from one place to another), 38.8% of these families received VGF grain 
 (mainly wheat) and 31.6% received GR grain (mainly 
 rice). VGF was fairly well-targeted by expense. 
 Anyway, 17.2 and 11.2% of the families in 
 the top two quintiles were people (who were part of a study, etc.). However, the 
 size of these moves (from one place to another) was (compared to other things) small. The average value of VGF grain received by the participating 
 families in October and November 1998 was 202.0 
 Taka per household per month, equal to only 5.0% of 
 total household expenses. For VGF people (who were part of a study, etc.) in 
 the lowest quintile, these moves (from one place to another) were more significant, equal to 10.5% of total household expenses. 
 Table 3 presents data on household expenses and 
 moves (from one place to another) according to an index of household exposure 
 to the flood. This index measures the direct exposure 
 to the flood at the household level, taking into account 
 four factors: (1) the depth of water in the home; 
 (2) the depth of water in the house; (3) the length of time 
 (number of days) of water in the house; and (4) the 
 number of days away from home due to the flood. 
 For each of these four parts/pieces, we created an 
 index ranging from 0 to 5. The total flood exposure 
 index, equal to the sum of the part-related (numbers that change/things that change), 
 ranges in value from 0 to 18. Finally, a categorical 
 (number or thing that changes) was defined according to the value of the flood 
 exposure index: 0 =not exposed to the flood, 1-5 = 
 7 The seven flood-affected thanas, representing five out of six 
 divisions of the country, were selected according to two major 
 judging requirements: the extreme harshness of flood as figured out by/decided by the Water Board 
 and the percentage of poor people in the district in which the 
 thana is located. Given these two major judging requirements, some thanas that 
 were in the samples of earlier studies were purposively selected. 
 Families were randomly selected using a multiple stage chance sampling way of doing things (with the exception of families in one 
 thana that were in the sample of an earlier study). In all, about six families were selected per village, 36 per union, 
 and 108 per thana, for a final sample size of 757 families in 
 126 villages (see Del Ninno and Roy, 1999b, for a more described/explained 
 description of the sampling frame).

 moderately exposed to the flood, 6-10 = very much/very badly 
 exposed to the flood and &#126; 11 = very badly exposed 
 to the flood (for further details see Del Ninno and Roy, 
 1999b). 8 
 All together 57.6% of the families in the sample were very much/very badly exposed to the flood, while 28.9% 
 were not exposed to the flood. The flood affected both 
 rich and poor and there is mostly no relationship 
 between the extreme harshness of flood-exposure and the expenses as pointed to/showed by flood exposure by per person 
 expense cjuintile (Table 2) or per person expense by the degree of flood exposure (Table 3). 
 The VGF program was not effectively targeted according to flood exposure, even in the flood-affected 
 thanas studied. A total of 18.7% of the families 
 not directly exposed to the flood received cards, only 
 8 The findings of the analysis received/got using this flood exposure 
 index appear to be quite strong. Almost the same  results were gotten using 
 a different flood exposure index that uses only three (numbers that change/things that change) and 
 a different cut-off point (Del Ninno et a!. (2001)). 
 
 (a) little below the percentage of families very 
 very much/very badly exposed to the flood (24.5%). In contrast, 
 only 9.6% of the families not directly exposed to 
 the flood received help through the short term 
 GR relief program, compared with 36.7% of the very 
 very much/very badly exposed families. 
 In terms of leakages, GR was better targeted towards flood-exposed families than was VGF. Only 
 11.4% ofthe GR receivers, as compared with 24.7% 
 of the VGF receivers, were not directly exposed to 
 the flood. Neither program (accomplished or gained) broad coverage. 
 However, 69.3% of the flood-exposed families did 
 not receive GR, while 76.6% did not receive VGF. 
 Though VGF was better targeted to the poor than GR, 
 50.9% of the VGF receivers were (compared to other things) non-poor 
 families that belonged to the top 60% of the per 
 capita expense distribution or that owned 0.5 areas of land 
 or more of land. 
 In contrast to VGF, the moves (from one place to another) from NGOs were 
 especially well-targeted to the families exposed 
 to the flood. A total of 24.5% of the very badly

 Average move (from one place to another) received over the 4 month period, 15 July 1998 to 15 November 1998. 
 
 flood-exposed families received moves (from one place to another) from 
 NGOs, compared with only 2.7% of the non-flood 
 exposed families. The value of moves (from one place to another) per household was also nearly 10 times larger for the very 
 very much/very badly flood-exposed families, 20.5 Taka per 
 month compared with 2.1 Taka per month. The excellent targeting of NGO moves (from one place to another) to flood-exposed 
 families may be mostly explained by the types of 
 programs begun/tried by the NGOs at this time; relief 
 programs to the flood victims, mainly in the areas 
 that had been worsely affected by the flood. In 
 the thanas surveyed in late 1998, there were no major 
 non-flood relief NGO programs involving moves (from one place to another) 
 in kind or in cash in operation Private moves (from one place to another) were 
 not highly related to flood exposure and it is 
 important/famous that the poorest 20% of families received 
 only about 115 as much moves (from one place to another) per household (23.8 
 Taka per month) as did the average household in the 
 sample 121.5 Taka per month (see Table 2). 
 The analysis of the (things that decide other things) of participation in 
 GR and VGF programs, conducted using probit (moving backwards), provide further (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) of the degree to 
 which these programs were targeted towards the poor 
 
 and flood-exposed families (Table 4). The (moving backwards) clearly show that the judging requirements used for targeting 
 the families with respect to the level of flood exposure varied between the programs. Dummy (numbers that change/things that change) 
 for flood exposure, and especially dummy (numbers that change/things that change) 
 for extreme and very bad flood exposure, are highly 
 significant explanatory (numbers that change/things that change) for the participation 
 in GR. In contrast, flood-exposure (numbers that change/things that change) are not 
 (meaningful numbers) explanatory (numbers that change/things that change) for the 
 participation in VGF, even in this sample of families from flood-affected thanas. 
 The coefficients of the (numbers that change/things that change) that point to/show the 
 level of household wealth confirm that the VGF program was better targeted towards the poorer families. Landlessness and housing (features/ qualities/ traits) (tin 
 roof and the number of buildings in the household 
 compound) are (meaningful numbers) explanatory 
 (numbers that change/things that change) for participation in VGF. However, in the 
 GR moving backward among the household wealth (numbers that change/things that change), 
 only living in a house with a tin roof reduces the 
 chance of participation. 
 Other household (features/ qualities/ traits) and household size 
 (numbers that change/things that change) are not strong (things that decide other things) of the probabil-

 ity of receiving either GR or VGF moves (from one place to another). In the 
 case of GR, this is to be expected, since the flood is 
 likely to have affected all the families in a village, 
 ignoring household size. Anyway, there 
 appears to be a bias in the GR distribution towards 
 smaller families that have fewer younger children, 
 maybe because these families were more mobile 
 and had easiery reaching the distribution centres. In the case of VGF moves (from one place to another), targeting towards 
 larger families with more children might be expected. 
 However, few household (combination of different substances, objects, people, etc.) (numbers that change/things that change) are 
 significant, apart from those for the number of young 
 males, this way pointing to/showing that the overall level of wealth 
 (as reflected in the housing (numbers that change/things that change) discussed above) 
 was the main (thing that decides something) of participation in the 
 VGF program. Somewhat surprisingly, there is only 
 weak (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) of targeting towards female-headed 
 families. The coefficient on the dummy (number or thing that changes) 
 for female household head is positive, but it is very different from 0 only at a 17% confidence 
 level. 
 
 4. Ending/deciding (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) 
 Food security at the household level depends both 
 on availability of food in markets and on access to 
 food. 9 Liberalisation of (people and businesses that are not part of the government) imports of rice 
 and wheat in the early 1990s and resulting government policies supporting the trade in 1998, enabled 
 private imports to stabilise market prices and supplies 
 during the 1998 flood in Bangladesh. Government 
 direct distribution programs, though small compared 
 to private imports, anyway increased the access 
 to food by poor families. Given the tight useful thing/valuable supply restrictions that limit the size of distribution 
 programs, effective targeting is important. Immediate 
 relief efforts were well-targeted to flood-exposed 
 families, as were moves (from one place to another) from NGOs. VGF, a 
 medium-term program covered non-flood affected areas and, even in flood-affected thanas, was not targeted well to families directly exposed to the flood. 
 Anyway, according to survey data from the seven 
 flood-affected thanas, the program was (compared to other things) 
 well-targeted to poor families, with families in 
 9 Use, another aspect of food security, is not covered in 
 this paper.

 the three lowest expense quintiles rece1vmg an 
 guessed 75% of the food grain distributed through 
 this program. 
 More broadly, the Bangladesh experience with the 
 1998 flood illustrates the dual role of food aid in 
 increasing the availability and providing useful things/valuable supplies 
 that improve the access of food insecure families. In a liberalised trade government, where private 
 imports respond to price signals, food aid's (thing that's given/work that's done) to total availability of food may be (almost nothing/very little). 
 Anyway, foreign help in kind or in cash 
 can provide useful things/valuable supplies for give money tod, targeted distribution to food-insecure families - help not 
 otherwise possible under tight government budget 
 restrictions.
