 Abstract 
 This paper examines the labor supply of farm families in Nepal using a (not very long ago) developed way(s) of doing things that accounts 
 for the (happening at the same time) between production and consumption decisions of the families. Guesses of not important products of male 
 and female labor or shadow wages are received/got from an farming-based production function. An instrumental changeable approach 
 is then used to recover the household's (related to what holds something together and makes it strong) labor supply from differences/different versions in the shadow wages and income, as well as 
 other household (features/ qualities/ traits). The findings show/tell about that both male and female total labor supply are sensitive to changes in 
 shadow wages and income. Workers included in education is found to (use/put into action) a significant positive effect on output, but 
 has no (meaningful numbers) hit/effect on total labor supply of people. The results also rejects the existence of (producing a lot with very little waste) 
 labor markets in (away from cities) Nepal. Â© 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

 1. Introduction 
 An understanding of the response of the labor supply of farm families to changes in money-based opportunities is important for the (action of accomplishing or completing something challenging) of the dual 
 goals of income growth and equity in developing countries. Scientific studies providing information on the 
 (things that decide other things) of intrafamily portion of time in productive activities (did/done/completed) by (away from cities) families are 
 especially important in helping policy makers understand the effects of policies on individual welfare

 (Huffman, 1980). Also, knowledge from such 
 studies may show understanding of the helper (in an argument) role of 
 the family between public policies and the welfare of 
 family members (Rosenzweig, 1986). More (not very long ago), 
 Heckman (1993) argued that evidence on 
 people' labor supply decisions makes up/is equal to an important part of the understanding of group labor 
 supply. A lot of work has therefore been gave/reserved 
 to the analysis of time portion behavior of (away from cities) 
 families in developing countries. 
 Most of the scientific books dealing with time 
 portion of farm families in developing countries 
 are based on the idea (you think is true) of independence between 
 farm household production and consumption decisions 
 (e.g., Barnum and Squire, 1979; Rosenzweig, 1980;

 Ahn et al., 1981). Under this idea (you think is true), the farm 
 household acts as if it tries to (make as big as possible) (money made/good things received) from 
 its production activities, subject to production restrictions. The resulting farm (money made/good things received) then form part of its 
 full income restriction, subject to which the household 
 is assumed to (make as big as possible) its utility from consumption. 
 This approach is reasonable math-relatedally under certain ideas (you think are true). The well-known/obvious ideas (you think are true) made 
 are that (away from cities) labor markets are (producing a lot with very little waste) and free of 
 transaction costs, and that family and hired labor are 
 perfect substitutes. 
 While this separability idea (you think is true) provides (related to careful studying or deep thinking) advantages for scientific analysis, its faults/problems have been clearly recorded/supported in the money-based 
 books. Benjamin (1992) points out that market mistakes that results in hiring-in or off-farm employment restrictions, or even different (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) of 
 family and hired labor are all major sources of (dependent on each other) of production and consumption decisions. 
 Lopez (1984) also argues that farmers may have preferences towards working on or off the farm. The separability idea (you think is true) generally breaks down under any 
 of these conditions. For example, if there are no labor 
 markets, the household must equate its labor demand 
 and supply according to a virtual or shadow wage figured out by/decided by all the (numbers that change/things that change) that influence household 
 decision making (Singh et al., 1986). 
 Given that (away from cities) institutions that relate to the linkage of factor markets and (living somewhere) rights in developing 
 countries stop the working of competitive markets 
 for inputs and output, labor portion is likely to be 
 figured out by/decided by shadow wages rather than actual market 
 wages. Recent evidence also call into question the truth/trueness of the perfect substitutability offamily 
 and hired labor idea (you think is true) for developing countries 
 (e.g., Deolalikar and Vijverberg, 1987). 
 The purpose of this paper is to examine the labor 
 supply responses of males and females of farm families in Nepal to changes in money-based opportunities by applying a way(s) of doing things developed by Jacoby 
 (1993). For policy purposes it is more useful to examine the factors influencing the labor supply responses 
 of males and females separately rather than to note 
 the simple presence of each (male/female status) in the household. 
 By following Jacoby's approach, which permits the 
 analysis of poor (person) family labor supply behavior under 
 the different idea (you think is true) of nonseparability, the (serving to severely limit or control) ideas (you think are true) of separability can be eliminated. 
 
 Nonseparability between production and consumption 
 decisions hints that a change in any of the (coming from the outside of something) (numbers that change/things that change) affecting the production choices of the 
 household - such as changes in the prices of inputs 
 and outputs - will influence the labor supply choices 
 of the household, both directly and indirectly (Singh 
 et al., 1986). While the direct effects happen through 
 changes in the household's shadow (money made/good things received), the indirect 
 effects tend to happen through the resulting changes in 
 the shadow wages of family labor. 
 The paper is laid out as follows. After presenting 
 the possible (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) in Section 2, Section 3 describes the data used in the study. Scientific results are 
 contained in Section 4 and the paper ends with 
 a summary section outlining the main findings of this 
 paper. 
 
 2. Money-based model 
 The possible basis for the model presented below draws on the farming-based household model developed in Jacoby (1993) and Skoufias (1994). The 
 model thinks about/believes a two person household in which both 
 males and females both/together choose the consumption of 
 home produced products (that are bought and sold) (Q), market products (that are bought and sold) (G), their (pertaining to each person or thing) portion of time (T) between market work 
 (Mi), own-farm work (Fi), home production (Si), and 
 fun (L; ), as well as the inputs of male and female 
 hired labor (H;) into own-farm production, where i indexes males (1) and females (2). Time spent on market 
 work yields wage income that allows the household 
 to buy the market products (that are bought and sold) (G). The time gave out 
 to home production involves activities such as child 
 care and meal preparation. The effective real wage 
 earned from off-farm work (W;) is assumed constant. 
 It is further assumed that the number of children in 
 the household as well as (related to information about people) (combination of different substances, objects, people, etc.) of 
 the adult members of the families are (coming from the outside of something). 
 Given these (detailed descriptions of exactly what is required) the household is assumed 
 to (make as big as possible) 
 (1) 
 
 where U is household utility function, which is assumed to be strictly curved, and to possess second 
 partial derivatives. The vector Z limit/guidelineizes the utility function and summarizes household (features/ qualities/ traits), such as the number of people in each age and sex

 category. As in Jacoby (1993), C is total household 
 consumption, which is the sum of home produced (Q) 
 and market (bought something for money) products (that are bought and sold) (G). 
 The (biggest increase/best possible extent) of U is bound by the budget restriction: 
 
 G= Y 
 
 + W1M1 + WzMz- WfHI- WfHz + V(2) 
 
 where wi and wr are the wages of family and 
 hired labor, (match up each pair of items in order), and V is household nonfarm nonlabor income net of any fixed costs connected with farm-household production; the strictly 
 curved farming-based production function, Y = 
 Y (FI, Fz, H1, Hz; E), where Eisa vector of fixed inputs (e.g., land) and Y is farm output. The price of the 
 (made up of different things) consumption good is (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy)ized to togetherness 
 and set equal to the price of farm output; the strictly 
 curved home production function, Q=Q(S 1, Sz; A), 
 where A is a vector of fixed inputs. The farming-based 
 valuable thing that is either produced by the household 
 or (bought something for money) from the market is assumed to be perfectly substitutable with the home produced valuable thing. The following non-negativity restrictions are also 
 assumed to be binding: Si 2:0, Mi 2:0, Fi 2:0, Hi 2:0. 
 Also, all people are assumed to work in at 
 least one part/area (Li &amp;lt; Ti). 
 The first-order conditions for this problem state that 
 each household member equates their tax rate 
 of substitution between consumption and fun, or 
 shadow wage, either to their market wage or to their 
 not important product in either farm work or housework. 
 The decision of some family members not to participate in the labor market results in a budget restriction 
 that is non-linear in hours worked. However, Jacoby 
 (1993) shows that the (incline/smooth change of something between two points) of the budget restriction 
 is the shadow wage vector CWi) at the best, where 
 Wi = YL;, at which point the restriction is linear. This 
 needs/demands redefining the full income of the household 
 as: 
 A 
 
 *A 
 
 h 
 
 A 
 
 h 
 
 *A 
 
 A 
 
 V = Il (WJ, Wz, W1 , Wz; A)+ \II (WI, Wz; E) 
 +W1T + WzT 
 
 where W1 and Wz represent the shadow values of 
 male and female time, (match up each pair of items in order). Eq. (3) hints that 
 household 'shadow full income' CV) is composed of 
 'shadow farm profit', (Il*) with the opportunity cost 
 of family labor properly deducted and the 'profit' from 
 housework (\11*). The household full income restriction 
 tested at the best is then given as: 
 
 G + Q+ WILI 
 
 + WzLz = V +WIT+ WzT 
 
 (4) 
 
 where the expression on the left-hand side is the 
 value of total household expenses on products (that are bought and sold)  and 
 fun and the expression on the right-hand side is 
 the 'shadow full income'. Q represents the amount of 
 the home produced valuable thing at the best 
 (biggest increase/best possible extent) of Eq. (1) subject to Eq. (4) yields the 
 same first-order conditions as discussed earlier. Solving this changed utility (biggest increase/best possible extent) problem produces /gives up a 
 set of (related to what holds something together and makes it strong) household fun demand functions: 
 
 si. 
 
 (5) 
 Given that the shadow wages are the prices of pure 
 fun in Eq. (5), labor supply can be defined as total 
 hours in productive activities, instead of market 
 hours alone as found in traditional labor supply models using watched/followed wages (e.g. Huffman, 1980; Rosenzweig, 1980). Representing Pt as the total hours of work 
 of farnil y males and females in market work, farm production, and hours used in producing the home good, 
 the (related to what holds something together and makes it strong) labor supply functions can be written as: 
 
 (6) 
 
 s; 
 
 where Pt = T- L7 = 
 + Ft + M(, if Mt &amp;gt; 0, and 
 Pt = T-L7 = S7+Ft, if Mt = 0. Male and female 
 labor supply will generally depend on both shadow 
 wages, since men and women are not necessarily perfect substitutes in production, and separability on the 
 preference side is not (forced (on people)/caused an inconvenient situation).

 period between May 1996 and April 1997. Eight 
 villages were selected to represent the three broad 
 agroclimatic zones of the country. A layered random 
 sample of a total of 35 families was selected in 
 each of the eight villages to secure/make sure of representation of 
 all categories of families. The three zones include 
 the Terai, the Hilly, and the Huge zones. The 
 Terai zone which represents the low flat lands of the 
 southern part of the country is very good for cereal 
 and vegetable production. The Hilly zone is located 
 in the central part with a climate that ranges between 
 subtropical to hardenate. The area is carefully thought about/believed very 
 good for fruit production, with cereals and animals 
 production mostly practiced. The Area of mountains, 
 in the northern part of the country, has a climate that 
 is mostly good for animals production and mild/not extreme fruits, although cereals and potatoes are also 
 helped grow in the area. Mechanization is often hard 
 on the steep mountain slopes, and families tend 
 to (branch out into different things) their production activities by helping grow 
 different crops. 
 The survey collected described/explained information on farm 
 and non-farm activities, as well as (related to information about people) and 
 
 location (features/ qualities/ traits). Described/explained time portion information for each household member was collected 
 on two weeksly basis. So, males and females family 
 labor gave out to farm and non-farm activities were 
 fully recorded. Hired labor, (made different) by sex was 
 also included. 
 Table 1 summarizes the key (features/ qualities/ traits) of the 
 families. The input of land is measured as amount 
 of land actually used by the household in the year 
 of the survey. Since most families in the sample help grow more than one crop and also raise animals, and data on input use is not available, the approach by Huffman (1976) is followed by collecting different outputs using prices. The total value of 
 output is figured out/calculated as the sum of the value of all 
 crops collected, the sales of animal products and some 
 fraction of the value of the household's group. 1 The 
 value of each crop is guessed using village level middle-point prices of the prices that farmers point to/show their 
 crops would now fetch available to buy. This avoids

 chosen to represent the value of household's stock of animals.

 the problem of using the same set of prices for all 
 farms. 2 
 For the (number or thing that changes) physical inputs such as (material that makes plants grow better), 
 insecticides, seeds, and transportation, the only available data are levels of expense. Using such data in 
 place of amounts in the production function can lead 
 to (created unfair thinking in)/(unfair-thinking) guesses if input price difference/different version is big. Including the expense levels of these inputs 
 is, however, better than ignoring them completely 
 and suffering an left-out (numbers that change/things that change) problem (Jacoby, 
 1992). The value of farm equipment (mainly animal 
 ploughs), a dummy (number or thing that changes) for whether or not repeating crops are grown, and a set of location dummies 
 for Terai, Hilly and Huge zones of Nepal are 
 also included as explanatory (numbers that change/things that change). 
 Given that better education improves management 
 and may raise technical and allocative (wasting very little while working or producing something) of 
 the individual, education represented by the number of 
 years of education is used as an indicator of the possible working well of the individual. The average head 
 spent about 3 years in school. Female members of the household have a much lower education than males. 
 38% of males have no education, vs. 64% for females. 
 Age is used as a measure of experience. The use of 
 hired labor is quite low, accounting on average for as 
 little as 7.9% of total labor used in farm production. 
 
 4. The scientific guess 
 On condition that both household members work 
 on the family farm, guess of the labor supply 
 functions (6) can be done by substituting the not important 
 product of family farm labor for the similar 
 shadow wage, and by replacing full income with farm 
 (money made/good things received). As pointed out by Jacoby (1993), if the sample contains part time workers, the market wage could 
 be employed in place of the not important product of labor on the farm, gave/given working off the farm involves no transaction cost. The guess in the present 
 study go aheads in two steps. Guesses of not important 
 2 As argued by Bardhan (1979), if farmers face the same prices 
 and the true production possibility edge of something/unexplored area is curved, rather than 
 linear, crop composition cannot be allowed to change/differ  across farms, 
 since farmers are assumed to have the same technology. However, 
 if crop composition is (number or thing that changes) in the sample, movements along a 
 given production possibility edge of something/unexplored area will be interpreted as moves/changes in 
 the value of output.

 working well of family male and female labor are first 
 received/got through a production function analysis. The 
 guessed shadow wages and income are then used in 
 the second stage to guess the male and female labor 
 supply functions. 3 
 4.1. Guess of the production function 
 
 The Cobb-Douglas functional form is used to fit 
 the production function. (even though there is the existence of) its well known limits, the Cobb-Douglas form is used because early/incomplete analysis with more flexible functional forms 
 such as the translog, produced results that were (not resulting in anything). Specifically, most of the coefficients of the interaction terms were not (meaningful numbers), while 
 some of the coefficients turned out to be negative, opposite to good  expectations. 4 The advantage of the 
 Cobb-Douglas form is its ease of guess and (understanding/ explanation). The coefficient of an input in the function 
 represents the production ability to stretch of that input. The 
 production function is specified as: 
 n 
 
 In Yi 
 
 m 
 
 = L_)&#126;J In Xij + LYkDik + &amp;'i 
 }=1 
 
 (7) 
 
 k=l 
 
 where Yi represents the total value of farming-based output produced by farm household i, Xij is a vector representing the amount of input j used by farmer i, D K 
 is a vector of location dummies that represent some 
 location-clearly stated/particular (features/ qualities/ traits), such as topology and 
 temperature, which affect output but are not (capable of being seen and known) to an econometrician; a J and 'Yk are limits/guidelines, 
 and &amp;'i is an error term summarizing the effects of 
 left-out (numbers that change/things that change). The inputs included in the vector 
 Xj include cropped area, value of seed, value of (material that makes plants grow better), value of insecticide, expense on transporta3 As stated in Lopez (1984), if the production and labor suppi y disturbance are related, then greater (wasting very little while working or producing something) might be 
 (accomplished or gained) by employing a full-information guess method. Jacoby (1993), however, points out that even if the production function and the labor supply functions are linear in their limits/guidelines, 
 the later functions will generally not be linear in the limits/guidelines, presenting math-based (problems, delays, etc.). The approach of Jacoby 
 (1993) and McCurdy and Pencavel (1986) is therefore followed 
 in this study. 
 4 Jacoby's (Jacoby, 1993) study showed that while the (numbers-based) results may be sensitive to the functional form of the farming-based production function, the (not numbers-based) results do not change 
 much. 
 
 314

 tion, hours of hired male labor, hours of hired female 
 labor, hours of family male labor, hours of family female labor, hours of child labor (family and hired), 
 hours of draft animals services and animals inputs 
 (mainly medicine and feed). 
 The age and level of education of household head 
 are also included as proxies for the management input. 
 This is done under the idea (you think is true) that the household 
 head, whether male or female, is also the first (or most important) decision maker on the family farm. In the moving backward, all 
 the (things that you control (like study times), that cause other things to change (like test scores)) except for the dummies are 
 in logarithmic form. Given the presence of zero values 
 in most of the changeable inputs, the logarithmic change was carried out by adding one to all the inputs, 
 except land and adult male and female labor which 
 are always positive by construction of the sample. 
 Table 2 reports OLS guesses of the coefficients of 
 the production function. The results point to/show that most 
 of the inputs have significantly positive effects on farming-based output. Land appears to be an important input 
 in the production process. With the important/famous exception 
 of child labor, all the (numbers that change/things that change) representing labor are 
 very different from zero. The coefficients for 
 the labor (numbers that change/things that change) show that the use of family labor 
 has a greater hit/effect on farming-based output than the 
 use of hired labor, supporting the guess that family members have stronger work (rewards or reasons for doing something) compared 
 to hired labor. Quite striking is the fact that family 
 male labor has a greater hit/effect on output than family 
 female labor. This result is in contrast to the findings 
 reported by Skoufias (1994) who finds that family female labor has a greater hit/effect on output than family male labor in India. The result here is probably 
 because the activities such as ploughing, 
 which are begun/tried by men, add/give more at the 
 margin to output than activities such as weeding and 
 transplanting in which females are mostly working at 
 Nepal. The head's education also has a positive and 
 significant hit/effect on farming-based output, confirming 
 the widely accepted role of workers toward improving farmers' (wasting very little while working or producing something) (Abdulai and Huffman, 
 1999). The choice of animals appreciation rate does 
 not seem to influence the guessed not important products 
 of male and female labor. 5 
 5 
 
 When the rate is set at 0.2 or 0.3, instead of 0.25, the resulting 
 not important products are perfectly related to those came/coming from 
 the guesses reported in Table 2. 
 
 Given that the physical inputs themselves are 
 likely to be endogenous (numbers that change/things that change), the guesses 
 from OLS could be (created unfair thinking in)/(unfair-thinking). Because of this, instrumental changeable way of doing things (IV) is also applied to guess the 
 Cobb-Douglas production function. The second column in Table 2 presents the instrumental (number or thing that changes) 
 guesses. The (numbers that change/things that change) used as identifying (tools or objects used to do work or measure something) in the guess are pointed to/showed at the bottom 
 of Table 2. The value of the Wu-Hausman statistic 
 given in Table 2 hints that the (tools or objects used to do work or measure something) can be 
 thought about/believed (coming from the outside of something) in the guess. Following 
 Jacoby (1993), the shadow wage rates (or not important 
 products) of family male and female labor hours are 
 calculated from the instrumental (number or thing that changes) guesses of 
 the Cobb-Douglas production presented in Table 2, 
 using the formula: 6 
 
 CLjY 
 
 wi = -A 
 
 Fi 
 
 i 
 
 = 1,2 
 
 (8) 
 
 where Y is the (described the future) value of output came/coming from 
 the guessed coefficient i. F1 and Fz are the total 
 hours of labor by adult male and female, (match up each pair of items in order). 
 The guesses of the shadow income of the household, 
 V* is figured out/calculated as: 
 
 a 
 
 V* = Y +\II+ V- 
 
 W1F1- WzF2- W1H1 
 
 - W2H2 - Wa ANIM- FERTV- INSV 
 
 -SEEDY 
 
 (9) 
 
 where \II is the sum of net returns from sales of 
 animals products and trade and artworks, V is 
 non-labor income such as land rent and moves (from one place to another) received by families, W1, W2, Wa are village average 
 wage rates for males, females, and animal services, 
 (match up each pair of items in order); FERTV, INSV, and SEEDY are expenses on (material that makes plants grow better), insecticide, and seeds, (match up each pair of items in order). 
 4.2. (detailed description of exactly what is required) of the labor supply functions 
 
 The labor supply of males and females are fitted 
 separately to data for the farm families used in the 
 previous analysis. Analysis is focused on hits/effects of 
 wages, income and other (coming from the outside of something) (numbers that change/things that change) on the 
 6 As pointed out by a referee, instrumental (number or thing that changes) guesses are 
 better than OLS guesses, since the idea (you think is true) of (coming from the outside of something) 
 inputs in the production function argues with effects/results/suggestions of the

 are figured out/calculated as the average number of hours per day 
 spent in farm work, off-farm self-employment, wage 
 employment and housework by males and females in 
 the household, (match up each pair of items in order). Time spent on social (formal, special events or series of actions), religious activities, and other total/totally/with nothing else mixed in consumption activities, such as eating or sleeping are carefully thought about/believed as fun. All females in the sample reported 
 positive hours for farm work and domestic activities, 
 while all males reported positive hours for farm work, 
 with some reporting positive hours for domestic activities. The average daily hours in non-fun activities (total hours worked) are 8.5 for males and 10.0 
 
 for females, pointing to/showing that women spend more time 
 in working than men.

 sition (numbers that change/things that change), etc. affecting taste towards work, a's 
 are limits/guidelines to be guessed, and f.Li is an error term 
 summarizing the effects of unseen factors. 7 As 
 in the production function analysis, age and education are measured in years. Including age in quadratic 
 form allows guess of life cycle produces. Number 
 of adult males and females, as well as children in 
 the household are also included. The reasons for 
 including children is that women with children of 
 pre-school or first (or most important) school age are less likely to 
 have time to work at market activities. 
 The coefficients a13 and a23 provide guesses of 
 the income elasticities of male and female labor, (match up each pair of items in order). If fun is a (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) good, higher levels 
 of income would result in fewer hours of work. Previous studies generally support this guess although 
 guesses have been inelastic (Jacoby, 1993; Skoufias, 
 1994). The guessed coefficients au_pair and azz represent the un-paid-for own-wage elasticities for 
 males and females, (match up each pair of items in order), while a12 and a21 
 provide guesses of the un-paid-for cross-wage 
 elasticities. 
 To get consistent guesses, the labor supply 
 functions are guessed using instrumental changeable 
 procedure. In the first-stage, the shadow wage rates 
 and shadow income are moved backward on (numbers that change/things that change) of 
 household composition such as the number of children less than or equal to 14 years, and the number 
 of males and females greater than or equal to 15 
 years and less than 60 years, individual (features/ qualities/ traits) 
 such as age and age squared, and number of years 
 of education; zonal dummies, value of buildings, 
 land and farm tools owned by the household, 
 and all the (tools or objects used to do work or measure something) that are given in Table 2. 
 The (described the future) values from these (moving backwards) are then 
 used in the second stage to guess the labor supply 
 functions employing ordinary least squares. 
 Guessing the labor supply functions with the (described the future) values needs/demands deleting some (numbers that change/things that change) that are 
 used in the first stage moving backward to allow for identification of the models. Household valuable things such as land and 
 value of buildings, village level wage rates, and the 
 interaction (numbers that change/things that change) were deleted from the labor sup- 
 
 ply functions, this way serving as identifying (tools or objects used to do work or measure something). 
 The Wald test statistics Cxr0) for the combined importance 
 of these (numbers that change/things that change) in the shadow wage equations are 
 20.06 and 24.28 for males and females, (match up each pair of items in order), 
 against the critical value of xio{,O.OS) = 18.31. The 
 corresponding figure for the shadow income equation 
 is 23.19, also against a critical value of Xfw,o.OS) = 
 18.31. The combined importance of these (numbers that change/things that change) in the 
 first stage (moving backwards) hints that the (tools or objects used to do work or measure something) do 
 enter the first stage guess and are therefore appropriate (tools or objects used to do work or measure something) (Staiger and Stock, 1997). 
 Table 3 presents the limit/guideline guesses of 
 the male and female labor supply functions. The 
 Breusch-Pagan test was employed to test for possible heteroskedasticity that may be caused by 
 the two-stage procedure of using guessed shadow 
 wages and income as well as heteroskedasticity possibly present across families. The figured out/calculated xr3 
 values of 23.45 and 24.53 for males and females, (match up each pair of items in order), are above the critical value of 22.4 at the 
 5% level, suggesting the presence of heteroskedasticity. In order to account for the heteroskedasticity, 
 the t-statistics reported are calculated from White's 
 (White, 1980) formula that accounts for nonparametric forms of heteroskedasticity. The values of the 
 Wu-Hausman statistics given in the Table suggest 
 that the (tools or objects used to do work or measure something) can be thought about/believed (coming from the outside of something) 
 in the labor supply functions. The combined guesses 
 that all non-intercept coefficients in the labor supply 
 models are zero are tested with Wald statistics. The 
 sample values of the Wald statistics 8 are 27.79 and 
 26.82 for the male and female labor supply functions, 
 (match up each pair of items in order), with a critical value of xr3,0.05 = 22.4, 
 this way rejecting the null guesses. 
 Agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with Jacoby's findings, the guesses of 
 un-paid-for own-wage effects are significant and 
 positive for both males and females, suggesting an 
 upward sloping labor supply. The findings, however, 
 contrast with backward bending market labor supply 
 functions reported by Skoufias (1994) for Indian females and Rosenzweig (1980) for Indian males. More than that, the own-wage elasticities are (a) little higher for 
 men than for women. Given that the definition of 
 
 7 It is significant to say that the guessed shadow income 
 and not important products of family male and female labor are household specific and as such take on the same value for different 
 members of the household of the same (male/female status). 
 
 8 In carrying out tests of (meaningful numbers) using White 
 (1980) standard errors, Wald statistics must be employed in preference to F-tests. This follows from the fact that the later relies 
 on the idea (you think is true) of homoscedastic errors (Greene, 1997).

 a 
 
 labor supply used in this study includes housework, a 
 greater response by females to changes in their shadow 
 wage should not be expected good (Jacoby, 1993). 
 Both point guesses of shadow income are significant 
 and negative for males and females, pointing to/showing that 
 both male and female fun are (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) products (that are bought and sold). The 
 income elasticities are greater for men than women, 
 a finding that is in line with the results received/got by 
 Skoufias (1994) for India, but differs from that of 
 Jacoby (1993) for Peru. 
 The cross male wage effect available to buy labor supply of females is negative and significant, pointing to/showing 
 that female labor supply is sensitive to movements in 
 the male wage. This is agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with family utility 
 (biggest increase/best possible extent) and points to/shows that studies that restrict 
 such cross-wage effects to be zero may result in (detailed description of exactly what is required) errors. 
 The age (number or thing that changes) represents a combination of experience and life-cycle effects on labor supply. The coefficients suggest that more experience at first tends 
 to increase the market labor supply of people, although at a decreasing rate. The labor supply of males 
 
 and females begin to decrease after the ages of 39.1 
 and 35.9, (match up each pair of items in order). There is no effect of the number of years of education on the labor market decisions 
 of families, pointing to/showing that the main hit/effect of education on male and female labor supply is indirect 
 through farm a money-making state and not important working well 
 of male and female time in farm production. The number of children appears to have no significant impact 
 available to buy labor supply of males and females in 
 Nepal, a result that is agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with findings based 
 on data from other developing countries (Rosenzweig, 
 1980; Abdulai and Delgado, 1999). The presence of 
 other men and women in the household of working 
 age tends to increase the market labor supply of men. 
 However, the (number or thing that changes) representing the number of men 
 of working age in the household has a negative, although (related to numbers) unimportant effect in the women's 
 labor supply equation. 
 To check whether the guesses under the nonseparability idea (you think is true) differ from the usual separability 
 idea (you think is true), the male and female labor supply functions are re-guessed using the average market wages

 (W;) in place of the shadow wages (W;), and non-labor 
 income in place of the shadow income ('.'\ ). These 
 results are reported in Table 4. It can be watched/followed 
 that the guesses received/got using market wages differ 
 from those with shadow wages discussed above. In 
 particular, the coefficients for the wage and income 
 (numbers that change/things that change) are much higher, while the own-wage effects 
 are negative for males and females, suggesting that 
 ideas (you think are true) about separability are important in labor 
 supply guesses (Skoufias, 1994). 
 4.3. Examining the (state where all things are equal) of market wage and 
 not important working well 
 In order to gain further ideas of the (producing a lot with very little waste) 
 functioning of labor markets in (away from cities) Nepal, the guess of (state where all things are equal) between not important products of labor and the market wages is tested in this section. This 
 is done by using the sub-samples of males and females 
 who report working mostly for wages during the survey period. About 39% of males and 34% of 
 females in the sample fall in this category. Under the 
 idea (you think is true) that families (make as big as possible) utility, the effective wage received by family members participating in the non-farm labor market should be equal to 
 
 the not important working well of work on the family farm. 
 Further assuming that working off the farm involves no 
 transaction cost, the effective wage reported should be 
 equal to the market wage. As in Jacoby (1993), the 
 following moving backward is guessed to (check for truth/prove true) the (state where all things are equal) 
 of not important working well and wage rate 
 (11) 
 where W; is the guessed shadow wage of male and 
 female labor, W; is the wage received by working in 
 the market, and v; is a random term probably including 
 measurement error. 
 As pointed to/showed above, utility (biggest increase/best possible extent) and (wasting very little while working or producing something) of the labor market suggest that a=O, and b= 1. 
 This means that the portion of time between farm 
 and market is made purely on (wasting very little while working or producing something) grounds by 
 people in the sub-sample. The explanation also hints 
 that v; is independent of the taste for work. In addition 
 to the OLS guesses, instrumental changeable guess 
 is also carried out to account for possible measurement errors in the wage rates. 
 Table 5 reports the guesses of Eq. (11). The 
 F-statistics from the OLS and instrumental (number or thing that changes) 
 guesses presented in the Table 5 show that the 
 null guess of (state where all things are equal) between the not important

 product and wage rates can be rejected for both males 
 and females. This finding is in line with the earlier results reported by Jacoby (1993) and Skoufias 
 (1994). The presence of transaction costs or other 
 mistakes such as commuting cost or disutility 
 connected with working off the farm, or employment 
 restrictions in the labor market, could be responsible 
 for the (state where two things are not the same) between the not important product and 
 the market wage. It is, however, important that even 
 under these facts or conditions (that surround someone), the not important product and 
 the shadow wage would still be equal (Jacoby, 1993). 
 The findings here indirectly lend some support to 
 the concern about (dependent on each other) of production and 
 consumption decisions of farm families (Table 5). 
 
 5. Ending/deciding statements 
 Farm families in developing countries often face 
 partly (not there; not present) labor markets or institutionally forced 
 restrictions. Under such conditions, families tend 
 to face a shadow wage that depends on both production technology and household preferences. Because of this, it 
 is significant to examine how their labor supply is affected by changes in their shadow wages and income. 
 This paper applied a model that allows the guess of the labor supply of farm household members 
 under the idea (you think is true) of nonseparability between production and consumption decisions of families to 
 a sample of 280 Nepalese farm families. Guesses 
 of the not important productivities of family male and female labor were came/coming from an farming-based production function. In a second stage, the guessed shadow 
 wages and income were then used to examine the 
 
 319 
 
 response of individual time of work to changes in the 
 money-based conditions facing the household. 
 (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) was found to support the behavioral 
 idea (you think is true) that farm families set apart their 
 members' time as if to (make as big as possible) a family utility 
 function. The male and female labor supply function 
 guesses appeared almost the same  in many respects to econometric labor supply findings based on other developing country data sets. Specifically, the total hours 
 of male and female work were found to be sensitive 
 to changes in the shadow wages and income. An increase in the wage rate of a family member tends to 
 worsens/decreases the market labor supply of 
 other family members. These cross wage effects on 
 the labor supply of family members provide (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) 
 on the a big role of the family as an helper (in an argument) 
 between public policies and individual welfare. 
 The results also were agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with the guess 
 that education improves farming-based working well in 
 Nepal. In contrast to a few studies on labor supply 
 of farm families in developing countries, education did not seem to have a direct effect on either male 
 or female total hours of work. This hints that the 
 main hit/effect of education on male and female market labor supply is indirect through farm a money-making state 
 and not important working well of male and female time in 
 farm production. What's more, the analysis provides 
 (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) against the perfect factor market guess. 
 A finding that is in line with much of the development 
 books in which inefficient markets are regarded 
 as part of the money-based (wide view of a nature scene/wide area of beautiful land) in developing 
 econonnes. 
 The way(s) of doing things employed here provides further 
 information on the usefulness of shadow wages in guessing time portion models, especially where 
 wage data are not available, or the conditions needed/demanded 
 to make use of available wage data are not in place. 
 This information is very important to establish distributional
