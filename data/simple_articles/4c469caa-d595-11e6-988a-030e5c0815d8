 Abstract 
 Bug-killers are used as the first (or most important) method of pest control in Asian rice production. Conditions in China have led to demand for 
 high and increasing rice yields, resulting in intensive (producing crops/helping something grow) and adoption of (material that makes plants grow better) (able to reply or react/quick to respond) varieties. The 
 result has been (existing all over a large area) pest (situations where large numbers of harmful or disgusting things exist). Many studies have guessed bug-killer working well, but few have 
 guessed the working well of other choice methods of pest control, namely host-plant resistance. None have guessed the 
 substitutability between these methods of pest-control. The working well of bug-killers and host-plant resistance, and the 
 substitutability between them is measured using two-stage Cobb-Douglas and translog production functions. Under intensive 
 rice production systems in eastern China, bug-killer working well is low compared to the working well of host-plant resistance. In 
 fact, returns to bug-killer use are negative at the margin. Host-plant resistance is an effective substitute for bug-killers and 
 big reductions in bug-killer use could be (accomplished or gained), with no loss in rice production, through improvements in host-plant 
 resistance. These results suggest that bug-killers are being overused in eastern China and host-plant resistance is being (used much less than expected). Government policies to (help increase/show in a good way) increased bug-killers in rice might be ill (gave opinions about what could or should be done about a situation) given the low working well and 
 negative returns, especially because of well known negative externalities connected with bug-killer use. Â© 1998 Elsevier

 1. Introduction 
 Farmers around the world are involved in a constant 
 fight, the fight against crop destroying pests. Pests 
 can cause crop damage and reduce farmers' welfare. 
 Luckily, producers can lessen the hits/effects of 
 crop pests, and do so most commonly by applying 
 chemical bug-killers. Reliance on bug-killers as the

 first (or most important) or only means of pest control, however, 
 may not be the most money-making or (able to last/helping the planet) plan, 
 and may have some harmful side effects. In the 
 fight against pests, bug-killers are a double-edged 
 sword. 
 Since the mid-1970s, (people who work to find information) have described 
 unintended results from bug-killer use in farming, especially in developing countries, and a few money-based studies have asked whether 
 current patterns of bug-killer use are (money-based)/cheaply 
 and socially (producing a lot with very little waste). Policy makers in many countries 
 have begun to control bug-killer use, and have taken

 interest in other choice methods for controlling farming-based pests. One method of non-chemical pest control 
 in field crops is the development and spreading around of 
 varieties with host-plant resistance. A resistant crop 
 variety suffers smaller yield losses than non-resistant 
 varieties when subjected to pest (situation where something is filled with lots of something harmful or disgusting). Hostplant resistance may also substitute for and/or complement chemical bug-killers in reducing pest losses 
 and increasing crop yields. 
 The role of host-plant resistance as a pest control 
 other choice raises a few important concerns about 
 commonly watched/followed farming practices. For 
 example, if now available vanetles are 
 already resistant to damaging pests, why do farmers 
 continue to use heavy doses of bug-killers? In the 
 presence of host-plant resistance, do bug-killer-based 
 reductions in pest damage permit the cost of the 
 bug-killer? (related to scientific farming) (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) hints that in some 
 cases they do not; common rates of bug-killer usage 
 may be inefficient in the presence of host-plant resistance (Buntin et al., 1992; Robinson et al., 1978; 
 Teetes, 1994). 
 While studies of bug-killer working well are common, few (people who work to find information) have tested the 
 production hits/effects of host-plant resistance and almost 
 none have explored the interactions between bug-killers and host-plant resistance. The goal of this 
 paper is to Â·analyze the faults/problems of China's bug-killer-intense insect and disease control plans by 
 examining the relative working well of bug-killers and 
 host-plant resistance, and the interactions between 
 them. To meet this goal, the paper first describes 
 the pest management plans used by China's farmers and the (rewards or reasons for doing something) for input intensive rice production that lead to high bug-killer use. The paper then 
 examines the effectiveness of pest control plans 
 on rice production in eastern China, plans based 
 on high levels of insecticide and fungus-killer use as well 
 as adoption of varieties which contain insect and 
 disease resistance. Finally, the paper discusses the 
 possible reasons why farmers apply high rates of 
 bug-killers and do not effectively use host-plant 
 resistance, and the policy effects/results/suggestions of such behavior. 
 To narrow the extent of/the range of the work, the paper 
 addresses pest management practices in two areas 
 of eastern China, Zhejiang and Jiangsu. In order to 
 collect the data necessary to carefully carefully study pest 
 
 control working well, the authors studied the production and management behavior of farmers in China's 
 most important cropping part/area during more than a 
 year of field work, collecting a (like nothing else) set of production, varietal, and pest (situation where something is filled with lots of something harmful or disgusting) data at the township 
 level. 
 
 2. (process by which something becomes stronger or worse) of farming and (situation where something is filled with lots of something harmful or disgusting) of 
 pests in eastern China 
 Life-giving soil and plentiful water supplies make 
 China's greater Yangtse River Delta area one of 
 the world's most productive rice growing areas. 
 With low per person land availability (Table 1), farmers in the area have usually/(in the past) created some of 
 Asia's highest rice yields through intensive application of labor (Table 1). As the area's population 
 growth has increased pressure on land, pressure has 
 also risen to increase rice yields to face/deal with national 
 concerns of rice independence. Farmers are needed/demanded 
 to sell a big amount of rice production to state 
 purchase (services businesses/government units) (Table 1). Although yield 
 increases are a priority for government leaders, 
 increasing off-farm labor opportunities have reduced labor availability and placed the load for 
 high yields on strengthening the use of (bought) 
 inputs (Table 1). These conditions have caused 
 China's farming-based research system to create, 
 and pushed local leaders and farmers to adopt, modern 
 farming-based technology, including bug-killers (Lin, 
 1992; Huang and Rozelle, 1996). For example, farmers in both Zhejiang and Jiangsu increased their use of 
 chemical (material that makes plants grow better)s at about 5% per year (Widawsky, 
 1996) while increasing their adoption of high-cooperating with/producing/giving up, input-intensive combination rice varieties. 
 2.1. Rising levels of pest (situations where large numbers of harmful or disgusting things exist) 
 Although pest (situations where large numbers of harmful or disgusting things exist) have always been a 
 feature of China's rice production, they became a 
 long-lasting problem with the adoption of (material that makes plants grow better) (able to reply or react/quick to respond) varieties, a result/argument from the (related to computers and science) revolution that began in the 1960s and has continued since 
 then (Chengxiang, 1988). Averaging over the four 
 major rice insect pests, the sample areas in Jiangsu 
 and Zhejiang experienced outbreaks about 
 1.5 times in 1985 and nearly two times in 1991

 Note: The study places/locations include eight townships in each of the eight counties across two areas in eastern China (Zhejiang and Jiangsu) for a 
 total of 64 townships. Data were collected for 8 years from 1984-1991. The number of bug-killer uses per year is an index of the 
 number of times the whole spread around area of a township was treated. The total area treated during each use is in a planned way recorded, and 
 divided by spread around area to create the index. Although some bug-killers treat bacterial sicknesses, for ease of labelling, all disease control chemicals 
 are here called fungus-killers. 
 Source: Authors' survey. 
 
 (Fig. 1, panel A) 1- Although disease generally 
 affected rice fields somewhat less, each plot experienced an outbreak about one time per season (Panel 
 B). If farmers had not responded with pest control 
 treatments, meaning bug-killer uses in the 
 study area, local farming-based (people in charge) guess that 
 
 from 15% to 35% of the total crop would have been 
 lost during the whole 8 year study period (Fig. 1, Panel 
 C, light bars). After responding with bug-killers, the 
 actual losses fell (dark bars), but farmers still lost from 
 3% to 13%. 
 
 2.2. Bug-killer use 
 1Percent 
 
 (filled with lots of something harmful or disgusting) area is calculated by adding total (situation where something is filled with lots of something harmful or disgusting) for 
 all pests and dividing by spread around area. When percent spread around area is 
 more than 100%, it points to/shows that on average more than one pest 
 had (filled with lots of something harmful or disgusting) the rice fields. (situation where something is filled with lots of something harmful or disgusting) figures, as well as potential 
 and actual loss figures, are guessed by technicians (sometimes 
 more than one) who are placed/assigned in every township in the study 
 area and also needed/demanded to guess crop losses from pests on an 
 outbreak by outbreak basis. They report the level of loss they 
 believed an untreated (situation where something is filled with lots of something harmful or disgusting) would have caused in the (not being there; not being present) 
 of bug-killer uses, as well as the actual loss got/caused by 
 farmers. 
 
 With the threat of crop losses from pests rising 
 during the 1960s and 1970s, government (people in charge) 
 took on/taken on responsibility for pest control mostly by 
 increasing the availability of chemical bug-killers. By 
 the 1980s, land-poor farmers in eastern China were 
 applying bug-killers regularly and at high levels 
 (Table 1). The frequency of bug-killer applications 
 on rice in most of the counties studied, is among

 the highest in rice producing Asia, just like that 
 of Japan (Edwards, 1986). Among the survey locations in eastern China, five of the eight counties had 
 average rates of insecticide use nearly twice that of 
 lowland watered rice systems in the Philippines, 
 where serious health and (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) effects 
 have been linked to bug-killer use (Rola and Pingali, 
 1993). 
 
 2.3. (bad results or effects) of intensive bug-killer use 
 With high rates of bug-killer use and the negative 
 externalities connected with such levels, there is a 
 concern about whether bug-killer use has reached 
 levels at which direct not important (things that are given/work that's done) are 
 minor, or maybe even negative. Insecticide sprays 
 early in a rice cropping season have been shown to 
 
 D. Widawsky et al.!Agricultural Money flow 19 (1998) 203-217 
 
 destroy (groups of people/animals/things) of natural deadly animals and cause 
 (situations where large numbers of harmful or disgusting things exist) of damaging pests such as brown 
 planthopper (Kenmore, 1980; Heinrichs and Mochida, 
 1984; Schoenly et al., 1996). The big thing/the important event of a 
 'pesticide spiral' may happen when heavy bug-killer use 
 in rice results in pest (groups of people/animals/things) that are bug-killer 
 resistant (Chelliah and Heinrichs, 1980). Increasing 
 pest resistance to bug-killers creates a situation in 
 which higher levels of bug-killer are needed to (accomplish or gain with effort) 
 the same level of pest control (Litsinger, 1989). In 
 China, field and laboratory studies have shown that 
 increasing resistance in pest (groups of people/animals/things) to high rates 
 of bug-killer use has decreased the effectiveness of 
 bug-killers (Chu et al., 1987; Su et al., 1991). 
 
 2.4. Host-plant resistance in China 
 While breeding efforts to incorporate host-plant 
 resistance in rice had started in other places, by the late 
 1970s some Chinese rice people (who help animals have babies) were devel- 
 
 207 
 
 oping pest resistant rice varieties. In some areas the 
 presence of resistance was ordered for seed certification. However, given the focus in farming-based 
 planning to development and (act of something getting bigger, wider, etc.) of farm chemicals, host-plant resistance was assigned a secondary 
 role, and adoption of varieties with host-plant resistance was rarely with decreases in bug-killer use. 
 (even though there is the existence of) this secondary status, local (people in charge) 
 extended and farmers in eastern China adopted a wide 
 organized row of rice varieties with host-plant resistance to 
 insects and sicknesses during the period of the survey. 
 On an average, most townships had between three and 
 nine pest resistant varieties planted by farmers 
 (Widawsky, 1996). Even with these resistant varieties, 
 producers in the study area continued to use bug-killers 
 at rates high enough that they may have added/have given to 
 a (worsening / rusting, crumbling, etc.) of the resistance (at first/before other things happened) included in 
 the newly released varieties. A big proportion

 For varieties that were grown over a whole period (e.g. 1984-1988) in a township, these figures reflect the% of (numbers of times something happens) when host-plant 
 resistance for a variety was lower at the end of the period than at the beginning. For example, 29% of varieties grown over the whole period 
 1984-1991 had (lowering in number/getting worse) resistance to neck blast. 
 b For the above (numbers of times something happens), when varieties had (lowering in number/getting worse) resistance over a period, these figures represent the proportion of (worsening / rusting, crumbling, etc.) that 
 happened based on the 5-point resistance scale. For example, among the 29% of varieties grown over the period 1984-1991 that had declining 
 neck blast resistance, the average rate of resistance (worsening / rusting, crumbling, etc.) was 35%. 
 c For all varieties grown over a whole period, these figures represent the average rate of resistance (worsening / rusting, crumbling, etc.). This includes varieties both 
 with and without (lowering in number/getting worse) resistance. For example, among all varieties grown over the period 1984-1991, the average rate of (worsening / rusting, crumbling, etc.) in 
 neck blast was 11%.

 period, experienced breaking down host-plant resistance 
 (Table 2)? Among varieties with broken-down hostplant resistance, the importance of resistance decline is 
 big, averaging 25%-35% decline for all pests 
 (Table 2). The average decline in resistance among all 
 varieties, both those with and without broken-down 
 host-plant resistance, is still large amounts of and raises 
 concerns about China's ability to maintain current 
 levels of host-plant resistance in its rice cultivars 
 (Table 2). 
 While host-plant resistance should aid in the struggle to maintain high yields by (making small) pest 
 damage, the process of breeding for insect and disease 
 resistance may be connected with lower yield potentials. A yield/resistance tradeoff may arise because 
 host-plant resistance is commonly strongest in landraces or other cultivars with lower maximum-(able to be done or reached) yields (Khush, 1987), and their including into 
 modem rice cultivars adds (related to tiny chemical assembly instructions inside of living things) material from land 
 races that may reduce yields. Back-crossing using 
 high-cooperating with/producing/giving up varieties can (make small) this trade-off, 
 but farming-based (people in charge) in eastern China pointed to/showed 
 this had not always been completely successful. 
 
 3. Modelling pest control in China 
 The discussion above raises a few important questions about the effectiveness of pest control practices 
 in China. Does applying bug-killers in rice permit their 
 use at current rates, especially in the presence of 
 improved varieties with host-plant resistance? Is 
 host-plant resistance a productive input in rice production? Can host-plant resistance effectively substitute for bug-killers as a form of pest control? 
 Answering these questions needs/demands measuring the 
 working well of both bug-killers and host-plant resis2 A way of measuring pest resistance for rice varieties grown in eastern 
 China is based on (in other countries) recognized methods of testing-related 
 pest resistance in rice (International Rice Research Institute, 1979). 
 Varieties that show some level of resistance are assigned a 
 (done or made to look the same way every time) resistance index based on their (chance of being harmed) (or lack 
 of it). In the study area in eastern China, the resistance scale ranged 
 from 0 to 5 and was based on judging requirements in government published 
 handbooks. Resistance data were collected from seed company and 
 plant protection departments at each location for varieties grown in 
 that location, and the status of resistant varieties was watched and followed/made footprints of over 
 time for each of six major pests. 
 
 tance, as well as measuring the tradeoff between the 
 two. This section outlines the scientific (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) for 
 carefully studying pest control in China, describes the data, 
 and presents results from the analysis. 
 Modelling pest control presents a challenge for 
 a few reasons. To guess their working well, measures of both chemical bug-killers and host-plant resistance need to be included in the analysis. To our 
 knowledge, no previous study has tried to treat 
 host-plant resistance as a directly measured input. 
 There are complex interactions between pest (situations where large numbers of harmful or disgusting things exist) and crop yields, and model (detailed description of exactly what is required) must be 
 (good or well enough) flexible to include limits/guidelines for interactions and substitutability. The use of bug-killers by 
 farmers and their effectiveness may also depend on the 
 level of pest (situation where something is filled with lots of something harmful or disgusting). For fair and (producing a lot with very little waste) 
 guesses of the hit/effect of bug-killer inputs on yields, 
 the frequency and extreme harshness of pest outbreaks need to be 
 taken into the process of carefully thinking about something. 
 
 3.1. Functional forms and scientific (detailed descriptions of exactly what is required) 
 The Cobb-Douglas production function has often 
 been used to guess bug-killer working well, but has 
 two faults/problems. The ability to stretch of substitution 
 between host-plant resistance and bug-killer (and 
 among all other inputs) is held back to be identically 
 equal to one, and a standard Cobb-Douglas model 
 does not account for the possible endogeneity of 
 bug-killers. If bug-killers are applied in response to pest 
 pressure, and high levels of (situations where large numbers of harmful or disgusting things exist) are related 
 to lower yields, then a relationship between bug-killers 
 and negative extras/payments in a production function might 
 bias working well guesses for bug-killer and host-plant 
 resistance. 
 To scientifically account for these factors, the first 
 modelling approach used in this analysis can be 
 specified as a two-stage Cobb-Douglas models with 
 interaction terms. The first stage to be guessed is a 
 log-linearized huge function for bug-killer 
 use:

 where Zp is the logarithm of insecticides and 
 fungus-killers, and is modelled as a function of scope 
 (A;) and (seriousness/ level) (Dj) of pest (situations where large numbers of harmful or disgusting things exist) and shifter 
 (numbers that change/things that change) (Ln and Sg). The coefficients to be guessed 
 are ao, a;, di, bh, and cg. Bug-killers appear as an 
 huge function since bug-killers are applied in 
 eastern China according to certain conditions (e.g. 
 pest (situations where large numbers of harmful or disgusting things exist)), but bug-killer use levels off rather 
 quickly. 3 
 Using (described the future) values of Zp from Eq. (1) and 
 allowing for interactions between chemical bug-killers 
 and host-plant resistance by including the terms z1z3 , 
 and ZzZ4, pest control working well can be guessed 
 from the log-linear production function in the second 
 stage:

 Or, a two-stage translog (detailed description of exactly what is required) 
 (where bug-killers are (described the future) from Eq. (1)) allows 
 for even more flexible not important products and substitution elasticities than the changed Cobb-Douglas one.

 where Z1 is insecticide, z2 is fungus-killer, z3 is hostplant resistance against insects, and z4 is host-plant 
 resistance against sicknesses (log-terms are in lower 
 case). The coefficients to be guessed are aÂ·&#126;' f3Â·}' 
 "fk&amp;gt; and 8h. The vector of 'normal' inputs, x, includes 
 factors such as (material that makes plants grow better) and labor, S accounts for 
 yield differences due to cropping patterns and 
 major weather events. Locational shifters, L, account 
 for fixed differences in (related to a large area) elements such as 
 water control, soil, and land life-creating ability. Including 
 pest control interaction terms in the production 
 function relaxes the restriction on fixed substitutability between bug-killers and host-plant resistance 
 that is like the Cobb-Douglas function, 
 but keeps/holds the cheapness of the form. If yields 
 and inputs are scaled by their geometric means, then 
 the ability to stretch of substitution can be expressed from 
 the guessed coefficients of Eq. (2) as (Boisvert, 
 1982): 
 
 3 The bug-killer equations were also guessed as simple linear 
 functions and there was very little difference in coefficient 
 guesses or moving backward coefficients. The huge form was 
 therefore employed because it helps testing of bug-killer 
 endogeneity in a Cobb-Douglas production function using 
 Hausman's (1978) method. 
 
 Using data scaled by their geometric means in the 
 translog production function, the ability to stretch of substitution of host-plant resistance for insecticides is given

 3.2. Data 
 
 The data come from a variety of sources in (away from cities) 
 China, and were collected by the authors during nearly 
 one year of (work done by traveling to a place to watch, listen, learn, etc.) in 1993. Township-level data 
 come from eight randomly selected townships in 
 each of the eight counties (for a total of 64 townships) 
 in Jiangsu and Zhejiang areas and were available 
 for eight years, 1984-1991. While most information 
 came from standard data reporting and (related to studying numbers) 
 collection sources, the written records of pest control 
 technicians from the 64 townships given information for (like nothing else) measures of bug-killer inputs, pest 
 (situations where large numbers of harmful or disgusting things exist), pest damage, and the level of pest-resistance for each variety. Rice yield was measured in 
 kg ha - 1 and explanatory (numbers that change/things that change) were specified as 
 follows. 
 Bug-killers: This study uses three common ways of doing things for measuring bug-killer use: real money-based value 
 (yuanlha), total/totally/with nothing else mixed in active ingredient (kg a.i./ha), and 
 
 210 
 
 D. Widawsky et at./Agricultural Money flow 19 (1998) 203-217 
 
 strength-(changed to make better/changed to fit new conditions) or 'effective' amounts where active 
 ingredient was (done or made to look the same way every time) by a recommended dose 
 for each bug-killer. Measures of all the three are 
 used for both insecticides and disease-control 
 bug-killers using described/explained bug-killer data collected in 
 each township; 
 Host-plant resistance: Each variety grown in each 
 location is assigned resistance scores (for 3 year 
 periods of time (or space)) to each of the four insects and two sicknesses 
 using a five-point scale (with higher scores being 
 connected with higher resistance). Variety-specific 
 resistance data are weighted in two ways. First, since 
 high resistance to a certain insect does not insure 
 resistance to all insects, pest-clearly stated/particular resistance 
 is weighted by the (number of times something happens) of that pest in the 
 township, giving more weight to resistance against 
 the most long-lasting pests. Second, since widely spread around 
 varieties (use/put into action) greater influence on township-level 
 yield than poorly spread around varieties, proportion of 
 spread around area in each variety is used to weigh varietyspecific insect and disease resistance, giving more 
 weight to cultivars that rule a township's varietal 
 mix. 
 Pest pressure: The proportion of total spread around area 
 (filled with lots of something harmful or disgusting) by a given insect or disease is an indicator of 
 the extent of pest pressure. (number of times something happens) of multiple 
 bug-killer treatments is included as a measure of the 
 extreme harshness of a pest (situation where something is filled with lots of something harmful or disgusting). 
 Other factors: Chemical (material that makes plants grow better) is included 
 as a total/totally/with nothing else mixed in nutrient amount of both nitrogen and 
 phosphorous (i.e. kg total/totally/with nothing else mixed in N/ha). Labor is measured 
 as the ratio of available laborers to total (helped to grow) 
 area (and showed strong positive relationship with 
 (related to a local area) guesses of per hectare labor use, as 
 listed in the state price (government agency/chest of drawers)'s cost of 
 production data). Machinery input is the proportion 
 of (helped to grow) area plowed by mechanical tractor. 
 Time is a substitute for technical change. The proportion 
 of double-cropping represents the influence of a 
 shorter growing season compared to single-season 
 rice production. A dummy (number or thing that changes) for (related to the Earth's weather) 
 disasters (e.g. a major flood in Gaoyou in 1991) 
 accounts for major production shocks. Purchase responsibilities quotas (in kg ha- 1) in bug-killer 
 (statement about the future) equations measure policy pressure to create high yields through the use of bug-killers. Fixedeffects, or county-specific dummy (numbers that change/things that change), account 
 for (related to space or existing in space) differences. The data are summarized by 
 
 their mean and standard moving away in Widawsky 
 (1996). 
 
 4. Results 
 Eqs. (1) and (2) were guessed as specified. 
 The two-stage translog model (Eqs. (1) and (4)) 
 produced different guesses, where some interaction terms were restricted to reduce multicolinearity.4 For each model, three guesses are received/got 
 going along with/matching up to the different methods for measuring 
 bug-killers. 5 
 The general performance of the yield function 
 guesses is fairly strong relating to/connected to bug-killer 
 (detailed description of exactly what is required) and yield function (Table 3). The 
 R2 -values of the guessed yield functions change/differ 
 from 0.53 to 0.59. Because conditions in eastern 
 China focus on high produces and input use, one 
 might expect that the high rate at which the usual inputs are used leads to low not important productivities. The working well of (material that makes plants grow better), labor, and 
 machinery are usually quite low, but are almost the same 
 to those found in other studies of intensive rice 
 (producing crops/helping something grow) in Asia, in general (Pingali et al., 
 1995b), and China in particular (Putterman and 
 Chiacu, 1994).6 
 Limit/guideline guesses from the bug-killer (statement about the future) 
 equations (show or prove) that bug-killer use is related 
 to rate of (situation where something is filled with lots of something harmful or disgusting) of both insects and sicknesses 
 (Table 4). Moving backward coefficients ranged from 0.42 
 to 0.57 for the insecticide equations and from 0.30 to 
 0.35 for the fungus-killer equations. Tests of endogeneity 
 4 Since there are four pest control inputs and four (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) inputs, 
 there are possibly 36 interaction terms alone which makes 
 guess (unlikely/not capable of being done). Therefore, the interaction which were not 
 restricted to be equal to zero were: squared pest control terms, 
 squared (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy)-input terms, insecticide* (insect resistance), 
 fungus-killer(disease resistance), and all nitrogen* (pest control 
 input) interactions. 
 5 Full moving backward summaries are given in Widawsky, 1996. 
 6 The other explanatory (numbers that change/things that change) in the yield equations all had 
 expected hits/effects on yield. The positive coefficient on the time 
 (number or thing that changes) supports the idea that (related to computers and science) progress happened 
 during the survey period, and is agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with other studies of rice 
 yields in China (Huang and Rozelle, 1996). Double-cropping is 
 connected with lower produces, the result of shorter growing seasons. 
 The coefficient on the (numbers that change/things that change) representing stormy weather 
 years is (in an expected way/in a way that was known beforehand) negative in all cases. 
 
 D. Widawsky et al./Agricultural Money flow 19 (1998) 203-217 
 
 reject the simple Cobb-Douglas model in which 
 bug-killers are assumed to be (coming from the outside of something)? Models of 
 rice yield that do not account for the relationship 
 between bug-killers, pest (situations where large numbers of harmful or disgusting things exist), and rice yields 
 may create (created unfair thinking in)/(unfair-thinking) guesses of pest control working well. Therefore, while some coefficient guesses 
 from the simple Cobb-Douglas functions are almost the same 
 to those of the other yield functions, we will (focus and increase) the rest of our attention on guesses came/coming from 
 the models where bug-killers are endogenous. 
 
 4.1. Guesses of bug-killer working well 
 Working well of bug-killers as measured by ability to stretch 
 of production, and allocative (wasting very little while working or producing something) as measured 
 by the ratio of value not important product of bug-killer to 
 the price of bug-killers suggest that farmers in China 
 are overusing chemical pest control methods 
 
 7 Endogeneity of bug-killers was tested using Hausman (1978) 
 method. The test is run by guessing the two-stage Cobb-Douglas 
 yield function with both (described the future) and actual bug-killer levels and 
 testing whether the coefficients on both (described the future) insecticide and 
 fungus-killer are both/together zero (an F-test). For value-based measures of 
 bug-killers the F-value was 4.18, for active ingredient based 
 measures it was 6.02, and for effective or strength-based measures 
 the F-value was 1.91. The first two tests comfortably reject the null 
 guess that bug-killers are (coming from the outside of something), and the last test is 
 somewhat less convincing. Exogeneity of (tools or objects used to do work or measure something) was tested 
 with Hausman (1983) method which simplifies to moving backward the 
 extras/payments from Eq. (2) on the (tools or objects used to do work or measure something). A low R2 -value hints 
 that the error is not related to the explanatory (tools or objects used to do work or measure something). A 
 high R2 -value rejects the null guess of no relationship (e.g. 
 exogeneity). The test statistic is IVR2 , where N is the number of 
 (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements). The test-statistic is distributedchi as (chi-squared 
 with 2 degrees of freedom, and had values of 11.46, 11.41, and 
 18.13 for the value-based, pure, and effective (detailed descriptions of exactly what is required) of 
 bug-killer, (match up each pair of items in order). The second nested (null) guess is that 
 there is no difference between the two-stage Cobb-Douglas and 
 translog models. Testing the null guess that there is no 
 difference between the models is carried out by both/together testing 
 whether all the interaction terms are equal to zero, a standard Ftest. In the guesses using value-based and active-ingredient based 
 bug-killers, the test statistics reject, with 99% confidence, the 
 guess that the two-stage Cobb-Douglas and translog (detailed descriptions of exactly what is required) are the same (F=2.102 and 2.2716, (match up each pair of items in order)). For the 
 model using strength-(changed to make better/changed to fit new conditions) active ingredient, the test-statistic is 
 F= 1.354 and rejects the null guess less convincingly at 83% 
 confidence. In spite of this, there is not too much difference 
 between the two (detailed descriptions of exactly what is required) in guesses of bug-killer working well, host-plant resistance working well, or elasticities of substitution, 
 as the next section shows. 
 
 211 
 
 (Table 5). 8 Small and significant production ability to stretch 
 for insecticide (and even negative in the case of 
 fungus-killers) point to/show that producers receive low returns 
 at the margin. Bug-killer use is allocatively inefficient 
 in so far as added/more bug-killer use creates costs 
 greater than the returns from higher yields. If bug-killers have negative net returns in production, and the 
 externalities of bug-killer use (which are not included) 
 have been shown to increase costs even further (as 
 shown in Rola and Pingali, 1993), then these results 
 may aid in creating future policies that reduce the 
 use of chemical bug-killers. 
 
 4.2. Guesses of host-plant resistance working well 
 Working well of host-plant resistance to insects, as 
 measured by its production ability to stretch, is positive for all 
 (detailed descriptions of exactly what is required) of the production models (Table 5). 
 These results show that host-plant resistance is effective at the margin in controlling insects. More than that, 
 money-based returns to improving host-plant resistance 
 may be big. One rough way to calculate the 
 value of host-plant resistance to insects in the two 
 study areas is to suppose a modest 1% increase in 
 host-plant resistance and use production elasticities to 
 calculate the value of the increase in rice production 
 that would result. The value of the increase in Zhejiang 
 and Jiangsu would range from$ 281 000 to$ 1.49 million. 9 These calculations do not take into account 
 supply responses and price effects from increased 
 production. Rather, they are a (experience-based thinking) device to 
 broadly define the high levels of direct benefits from 
 small improvements in host-plant resistance. In fact, 
 these benefits are big when compared to the 
 about $_$ 1.5 million per year that is spent on 
 all rice research in four areas in eastern China, 
 including Zhejiang and Jiangsu (Rozelle et al., 1996). 
 Resistance to sicknesses had negative guessed hits/effects 
 (a somewhat surprising result that may be 
 related to both the fast (worsening / rusting, crumbling, etc.) of the effective- 
 
 8These measures were calculated from guessed pest control 
 coefficients in yield equations (see Add on A). 
 9 These figures are based on area of control/area of land-wide rice production in 
 1993 of 17.13 million tin Jiangsu and 12.99 million tin Zhejiang 
 (ZGNYNJ, 1995), a rice price of 417 yuanlt, and an exchange rate 
 of Y 8.3/$. All prices in the analysis are (lowered/flattened from losing air) using the (away from cities) 
 price index.

 4.3. Ability to stretch of substitution of host-plant resistance 
 for bug-killers 
 
 Another striking result of the model guesses is 
 that in all cases, there is big (possibility of/possible happening of) 
 
 substituting host-plant resistance for insecticides. 
 Based on the elasticities of substitution, improvements 
 in host-plant resistance can be with 
 decreases in insecticides, with no loss in production 
 (Table 5). (pretty close) guesses of the value of 
 bug-killer savings from a 10% increase in the index 
 of host-plant resistance show that the savings from

 substituting host-plant resistance for insecticides 
 could be big. 10 
 
 10Calculations can be made almost the same as  the ones for approximating 
 the working well gain from improvements in host-plant resistance. 
 They show that the savings in insecticide ranges from US$_$ 305 000 
 per year to US$_$ 7.55 million per year. Once again, these results are 
 based on current prices that do not take into account price changes 
 from a shrinking insecticide market. However, as before, the 
 example shows that in just the two study areas, the benefits 
 from an improvement in host-plant resistance may well outweigh 
 the costs, and at the same time (in a big way) reduce negative 
 externalities from bug-killer use. 
 
 5. Discussion and ends/end results 
 Bug-killer use is high in eastern China, a result of money-based and policy pressures to raise 
 yields by strengthening input use. The difference 
 between (possible greatness or power) and actual crop loss might lead 
 one to decide that China's bug-killer-first policy 
 has been successful, a statistic often referred to by government leaders as the basis for continuing pro-bug-killer 
 policies. This paper has shown, however, that although 
 bug-killers may reduce crop losses on average, they are 
 probably being overused in Chinese rice production 
 while host-plant resistance is being under-used. All

 - Ability to stretch of production is tested at the geometric mean. 
 b Allocative (wasting very little while working or producing something) is the ratio of value not important product of bug-killer to bug-killer price. Value not important product is tested at the 
 geometric mean. 
 
 guesses show that current rates of bug-killer use are 
 allocatively inefficient at the margin, connoting inefficiency even without other issues such as 
 negative externalities. 
 Why are farmers overusing bug-killers? One reason 
 may be that farmers lack good information about the 
 working well of bug-killers. Studies in the Philippines 
 (Pingali et al., 1995a), Vietnam (Heong et al., 1994), 
 and in other places in Asia have shown that after farmers 
 received information about the true working well of 
 bug-killers in rice production, they decreased their use 
 of bug-killer, often very much so. Another argument 
 raised in trying to create agreement between negative returns to producers is that since farmers may be risk disliking, and 
 
 bug-killers may help reduce the risk of very bad 
 pest loss, the seen/obvious money-based inefficiency is, in 
 fact, only a clear risk higher cost and not money-based 
 inefficiency at all. Some of the studies referred to above, 
 however, have shown that ending of bug-killer use 
 has happened with no dangerous increase in yield 
 (quality of changing over time or at different places). Even if farmers are risk disliking, reducing 
 bug-killer use may not increase doubt. 
 The results also show that host-plant resistance, 
 especially insect resistance, is a productive, (used much less than expected) input. Benefits from improvements in hostplant resistance may be quite large. As a substitute for 
 bug-killers, improvements in host-plant resistance 
 could lead to big savings in bug-killers without

 reducing rice yields. Part of the under-use of 
 host-plant resistance may be grounded in a lack of 
 information. In spite of the fact that varieties with 
 host-plant resistance are widely available, there is 
 (almost no information or objects that prove something) that producers take into account available host-plant resistance in choosing how much 
 bug-killer to use. 
 All these results strongly suggest that China might 
 do well to reconsider its loyalty to/promise to increasing 
 bug-killer use in rice and think about/believe increasing investments in improving host-plant resistance. More importantly, it is very important to appreciate that the relationship 
 between the two is complex, and added/more described/explained 
 research on the energetic nature of pest control, (situation where something is filled with lots of something harmful or disgusting), and working well is needed.
