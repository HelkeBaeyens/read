 Abstract 
 Maize (Zea mays L.) is the most important cereal crop in the hills of Nepal, where the grain is used for human consumption 
 and the stover for animal food. Maize farms are small, and population pressure requires/results in the (process by which something becomes stronger or worse) of existing 
 farming systems. Maize research directed at developing technologies for maize production began in Nepal in 1965. In 2000, 
 a survey was carried out in two districts to decide/figure out the current level of adoption of improved maize production practices. In 
 each of these districts, remote and (easy to get to, use, or understand) village development (groups that decide or promote things) (VDCs) were surveyed. Lists of questions were 
 given to 54 randomly selected families in each VDC. A Tobit analysis was used to decide/figure out (related to how much money and power people have), 
 physical and technology factors that influence the use of improved varieties by farmers. All families use (applied fertilizer) 
 farmyard poop/fertilizer, and in the more (easy to get to, use, or understand) areas, urea as part of their soil life-creating ability management plan. Use of improved 
 varieties was less than 60% for all VDCs and only 15% in the most remote VDC. In three of the four VDCs, adoption of 
 improved varieties mostly happened during the past 5 years. Based on a Tobit analysis, Khet land area, (group of people related by culture, race, religion, etc.), years of 
 fertiliser use, off-farm income, and contact with extension significantly and positively affected adoption of improved varieties. 
 Farmers in VDCs in central Nepal reported lack of seed to be the major restriction to the adoption of improved varieties, 
 while lack of knowledge of new varieties was the major restriction for farmers in the western VDCs. The results from this survey suggest that the plan for improving the adoption of new varieties will differ depending on (set of machines) and the 
 (related to how much money and power people have) conditions of the farmers in a given area.

 1. Introduction 
 
 Farming rules the (process of people making, selling, and buying things) of Nepal, accounting for 80% of the work force and 40% of the 
 GDP. Although Nepal is most famous for its high 
 mountains, there are some 3.2 million ha of cereals 
 grown in the lowlands in the south of the country

 (the Terai), on the valley floors, and on the terraced 
 hillsides below 3000 m elevation. Farming is more 
 made money from in the Terai, where the road system 
 and markets are fairly well developed compared to 
 the hill area. The Terai provides most of the food 
 needed in the city-based  centres of the country. Though 
 the farm-related systems in the hills have been less energetic than those in the Terai, they are of extreme importance to Nepal's food security. About 50% 
 of Nepal's population lives in the hills. Due to the 
 limited road networks, combined with the remoteness 
 of most villages from established city-based  centres, the 
 (problems, delays, etc.) of moving food, and the lack of other

 cash-creating businesses/projects, food security in these areas is mostly dependent on farm produce. Maize is 
 the most important cereal grown in the hills, where 
 about 75% of the country's 800,000ha of maize are 
 located (Paudyal and Poudel, 2001). 
 In the hills, maize is (helped to grow) on sloping terraced 
 fields called Bari land. It is generally planted during 
 pre-bad rainstorm rains and collected before the end of 
 the bad rainstorms. In the eastern two-thirds of the country, finger millet is often relayed onto the maturing 
 maize crop, while in the western third, maize is rotated with a winter wheat crop. The rate of growth 
 in maize production has been less than 1% per year 
 over the past 20 years. Average maize yields during 
 1970-1984 (lowered in number/got worse/gotten worse) from 1900 to 1400kg/ha, probably due to the (act of something getting bigger, wider, etc.) of maize into not important land. 
 Since 1984, however, yields have improved to around 
 1800kg/ha (Adhikary et al., 2001). There is now 
 little scope for the (act of something getting bigger, wider, etc.) of maize area in the hills, 
 as most non-cropped land is either too steep for (able to last/helping the planet) production or is protected forest. In order to 
 just keep pace with the population growth rate of 2.3% 
 (CIMMYT, 1999), a big increase in the working well and production of maize is needed. This increase 
 will be dependent upon the development and adoption 
 of new varieties and crop management practices. 
 Maize research in Nepal was first begun/tried in an 
 organised way in 1965 (Paudyal and Poudel, 2001). 
 Since then, 15 improved open-(brought pollen from one plant to another) varieties 
 (OPVs) have been released by the national research 
 system for the different ecologies of the country, however, farmers commonly grow only five of these 
 (Adhikary et al., 2001). Movement of improved OPVs 
 has been held back by the lack of active seed business/project in the country. The National Maize Research 
 Program produces about 200,000 kg of foundation 
 seed, which is distributed to farmers, the Department 
 of Farming, and small seed producers (Adhikary 
 et al., 2001). There are no formal businesses/projects producing certified seed. The actual amount of certified 
 seed that enters the market is not known, but the area 
 spread around with improved seed, including combinations from 
 India that are grown mainly in the Terai and seed of 
 improved varieties that have been recycled for one or 
 more seasons, is guessed to be between 54 and 58% 
 (Adhikary et al., 2001; Aquino et al., 2001). 
 Most farmers in the hills do not have ready access 
 to inputs or information. Villages tend to be separated 
 
 from one another by forests, steep ridges, or rivers 
 and streams, and there are few roads good for vehicles, only paths between villages. (bought something for money) products (that are bought and sold) 
 must be carried by a porter or, on a more limited 
 scale, by mules. Due to the remoteness of most hill 
 villages from established city-based  centres, and the distance between villages in terms of travelling time, the 
 planning of running an effective extension program are 
 difficult/strong. For these reasons, the movement of technology is much slower in the hills than in the Terai. 
 The goals of this study were to decide/figure out the 
 rate of adoption of improved OPVs in two hill districts of Nepal and to (ask lots of questions about/try to find the truth about) factors affecting their 
 adoption. 
 
 2. Way(s) of doing things 
 The data reported here were collected as part of a 
 large survey carried out with support from the Hill 
 Maize Research Project (HMRP) to establish a (a measure of what occurs naturally/sports boundary line) for numbering the project's hit/effect in the future. 
 The survey was managed and did/done within two Village Development (groups that decide or promote things) (VDCs) of Dailekh district in the 
 mid-Western development area and in two VDCs 
 of Dolakha district in the central development area. 
 Dailekh and Dolakha were selected because they contain farming-based research stations that are active in 
 the HMRP. What's more, there is (compared to other things) little published information on the adoption of improved technologies in these two districts. The two districts differ 
 in their level of development. Dailekh lies within the 
 mid-Western development area which is carefully thought about/believed 
 to be less developed and have more poorness than other 
 areas within Nepal (Paudyal et al., 2001). Based on 
 discussions with district officers, one (easy to get to, use, or understand) and 
 one remote VDC was selected from within each district surveyed. 
 A random sample of farmers within each VDC was 
 selected from a person (who votes)'s list that had been updated with 
 the help of VDC (people in charge), or when this list was not 
 available from a list of farmers within a ward given by the ward chairman. Fifty-four families 
 were interviewed in each VDC and the total sample 
 size was 216. The survey consisted of a list of questions 
 given/gave by trained research staff. Only 206 of the 
 lists of questions were completed and used in the analysis. Means for different physical and (related to how much money and power people have) 
 
 J.K. Ransom et al./ Farming-based Money flow 29 (2003) 299-305 
 
 features were calculated for each VDC. For (numbers-based) data, analyses of variance using a completely random model with VDC as the (thing that changes (like a test score) because of something else that you control (like study time)) were 
 performed. 
 To guess the effects of different (numbers-based) and 
 (not numbers-based) factors on the extent of improved OPV use, 
 a Tobit model was used on the combined data. The 
 Tobit model is a changed (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) moving backward model. 
 Its guess is related to the guess of a changed 
 and cut short (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) distribution (Amemiya, 1973; 
 McDonald and Moffit, 1980). In this study, the Tobit 
 model was used to guess the limits/guidelines of the adoption of improved OPV maize by farmers in Dolakha 
 and Dailekh districts in the mid-hills of Nepal. The 
 function is guessed from a changed sample where 
 the sample population consists of both adopters and 
 non-adopters of improved maize varieties. 
 The scientific model of the effect of a set of explanatory (numbers that change/things that change) on the adoption of improved maize 
 varieties is specified using the following linear relationship: 
 
 + fJ1 X 1 + fJ2X2 + J3X3{ + f34X4 + fJsXs 
 + fJ6X6 + f37X7 + fJsXs + f39X9 + fJwXw 
 + fJuXu + fJ12X12 + f313X13 + e, 
 
 A= fJo 
 
 where A is the percentage of farmer's total maize 
 area planted to improved OPVs, fJo the constant, Xt 
 the area of Khet land owned by farmer (ha), X2 the 
 area of Bari land owned by farmer (ha), X3 the average size of plots farmed (ha), x4 the off-farm income 
 (Rs. 1000 per year), X5 the able to read and write head of household 
 (dummy; 1: able to read and write; 0: (can't read or write)), x6 the age of household head (years), X7 the district (dummy; 1: Dolakha; 
 0: Dailekh), Xs the contact with extension (dummy; 
 1: yes; 0: no), x9 the hired farm labour for maize production (dummy; 1: yes; 0: no), Xw the distance to 
 market (dummy; 1: :::Skm; 0 :.::;5km), Xu the social class 
 (dummy; 1: Brahman, Chetri and Thakari; 0: others), 
 X 12 the years of fertiliser use, and e the error term. 
 The coefficients of the moving backward model were guessed by applying the maximum chance guess (MLE) way of doing things. 
 Khet land is used for rice (producing crops/helping something grow). This (number or thing that changes) 
 was included in the model because farmers with more 
 Khet land tend to be better connected to markets, use 
 more inputs, and therefore may have better access to 
 information and seed. (numbers that change/things that change) Bari area and aver- 
 
 301 
 
 age plot size were included because farmers with less 
 area for maize production are under more pressure to 
 strengthen, and therefore possibly have more (reward or reason for doing something) to adopt new technology. Income from grain sales 
 points to/shows a connection with markets and an increased 
 (reward or reason for doing something) to produce more cereals on farm. Age of 
 household head, reading and writing ability and social class  are all important 
 because they are (related to how much money and power people have) factors thought to influence access to information. The changeable years of 
 fertiliser use was included because of the idea (you think is true) 
 that the adoption of one technology may make ready 
 the farmer to put into use other technologies. District, contact with extension, and distance from markets were 
 included because (set of machines) and availability of information were thought to likely affect the availability 
 of and demand for seed. 
 
 3. Results and discussion 
 Namdu and Kalbhairab VDCs were selected for 
 the survey from Dolakha and Dailekh districts, (match up each pair of items in order), based on their relative (how easy something is to get to, use, or understand). Maga 
 Pauwa and Chauratha were selected because they were 
 thought about/believed to be (compared to other things) remote. Based on the survey 
 results, however, market access was much lower 
 in Dailekh than in Dolakha, and the average distance 
 to markets where inputs are (bought) was much greater for both categories of VDCs (Table 1). 
 Overall, farmers in Chauratha were the furthest from 
 input markets, averaging 19 km. Since this distance 
 was based on farmers' responses and not on a direct 
 measurement, it may not be very correct, however, it 
 is still useful for comparing relative distances between 
 VDCs. The distance to the input market in the (compared to other things) remote VDC of Dolakha was just like that of 
 the (compared to other things) (easy to get to, use, or understand) VDC in Dailekh, pointing to/showing 
 that the road (set of machines) in Dailekh is far inferior to 
 that of Dolakha. Contact with extension was inversely 
 related to the distance to market, though it was poor 
 even in the most (easy to get to, use, or understand) VDC (Table 1). Reading and writing ability 
 rates tended to be higher in the VDCs in Dolakha 
 than those in Dailekh, while farm and household sizes 
 tended to be smaller (Table 1). The maize area was 
 almost the same  across VDCs and averaged only about 0.3 ha. 
 Farmers in Dailekh sold much more maize than 
 farmers in Dolakha, though the highest maize grain 
 sales reported in Chauratha, was only 29 kg per year.

 This hints that very little of the maize produced 
 leaves the farm for commercial purposes. 
 The use of farmyard poop/fertilizer (FYM) is the 
 traditional and most in control/most common method for maintaining soil 
 life-creating ability used by farmers in the hills. All farmers surveyed in all VDCs applied FYM (Table 2). Average 
 rates varied between 7000 and 8000 kg/ha and did not 
 differ significantly between VDCs. The percentage of 
 farmers using fertiliser was high in all VDCs except 
 Chauratha. The amount applied was generally low relative to the recommended rate (Pandey, 2000), especially in Chauratha, where only 6 kg/haN was applied 
 
 on average (Table 2). There was almost no application 
 of P fertilisers in all four VDCs. 
 With the exception of Namdu, where 59% of farmers used improved OPVs, less than 30% of farmers 
 used improved varieties (Table 2). Except for Namdu, 
 adoption rates were much lower than the national rate 
 guessed by Adhikary et al. (2001) and Aquino et al. 
 (2001). This hints that adoption rates are much 
 higher in districts not surveyed or that the national 
 guesses are higher than actual rates. The higher 
 adoption rates in Namdu may have been related to 
 the spreading around of information and seed from the

 Kabre farming-based research station which is located 
 nearby and has been active for more than 20 years. 
 The rate of adoption of improved OPVs was much less than the rate of fertiliser adoption. This 
 is somewhat surprising given the (compared to other things) higher 
 cost of fertiliser compared to seed, and the added/more 
 difficulty of moving (taking up a lot of space for its weight) fertiliser. Improved 
 open-(brought pollen from one plant to another) yields were higher (on average by 
 17% ), which clearly points to/shows the advantage of growing improved varieties. Generally yields were higher 
 in Dailekh than in Dolakha (Table 2). 
 The time of initial adoption of improved OPVs differed between Namdu, which had the highest adoption 
 
 level, and the other VDCs. In Namdu, most adoption 
 happened 5 or more years previous to the study, with 
 almost half of the adoption happening more than 10 
 years (before that/before now) (Table 3). In the remaining VDCs, 
 however, the limited adoption that had happened took 
 place 5 or fewer years previous to the study. 
 Based on the Tobit analysis, which combined data 
 from all of the VDCs, the (numbers that change/things that change) that significantly 
 increased the adoption of improved OPVs were area 
 of Khet land, (group of people related by culture, race, religion, etc.), years of fertiliser use, 
 off-farm income, and contact with extension (Table 4). 
 Hired labour was the only (number or thing that changes) that had a significantly negative influence on the use of improved

 OPVs. Of the factors that significantly impacted on 
 the adoption of improved OPV s, Khet area and (related to a group of people with the same race, culture, religion, etc.) 
 group were decided to  be important, but also unable to be managed or externally influenced. Farmers 
 with more Khet land tend to be better connected to 
 markets because rice is more often sold or traded than 
 maize. The negative effect of hired labour was decided to  be quite large. The use of non-household 
 labour in maize production is dependent on a number 
 of factors, e.g. the distance of the maize field from the 
 home or the amount of labour needed/demanded relative 
 to available labour. Farmers who do not hire labour 
 for maize production (i.e., those who have (good) enough 
 family labour) are more likely to adopt improved OPV 
 maize than those who hire labour. This is probably 
 because more labour is used per unit of land for helping grow improved OPV maize compared to local maize. 
 Of the remaining factors included in the model, contact with extension had the most dramatic influence 
 on adoption (Table 4). This points to/shows that information, 
 and not just seed availability, now holds back the 
 use of improved OPVs. Years of fertiliser use had a 
 minor good effect on the rate of adoption. This 
 may point to/show that farmers who have more experience 
 with technologies in general are more likely to test 
 and adopt new OPVs. Off-farm income had a positive effect on adoption, but the data suggest that large 
 changes in off-farm income are needed to create big increases in adoption of improved OPVs. It 
 is likely that farmers with large off-farm income have 
 one or more family members working outside of the 
 village. Not only would the increased cash allow the 
 family to buy inputs, but also the people 
 working outside the village would have the opportunity to get seed and information on new varieties 
 from other areas.

 To test the effects of each (thing that you control (like study time), that causes something else to change (like a test score)) 
 on the adoption of improved maize varieties, not important 
 effects were guessed (Table 4). It can be seen that 
 the same set of (things that you control (like study times), that cause other things to change (like test scores)) used in the first (or most important) index function show a significant effect on the 
 adoption of improved maize. 
 The not important effect of 13.5 for Khet land area 
 hints that overall people who responded, every 1 ha increase 
 in Khet land area would increase the adoption of 
 improved maize varieties by 13.5%. (in almost the same way), every 
 1000 Rs. increase in off-farm income would increase 
 the adoption of improved OPV maize by 0.2%, and 
 every 1 year of experience in fertiliser application 
 would increase adoption of improved OPV maize 
 by 1.0%. Among the dummy (numbers that change/things that change), the largest 
 change of 24.9% is related to (family and cultural characteristics) and the 
 second largest of 23.0% is due to contact with extension personnel. The results also hints that adoption 
 of improved OPV maize will be reduced by 18.76%, 
 if farmers need to hire labour for maize (producing crops/helping something grow). 
 The first (or most important) reasons given by farmers for not adopting improved OPVs differed between the two districts. 
 In both VDCs in Dolakha, the lack of seed availability was the first (or most important) reason for not growing improved 
 OPVs, while in the VDCs of Dailekh, the lack of 
 knowledge of improved OPVs held back their adoption (Table 5). These data do not support the commonly repeated idea that farmers do not grow improved OPVs because these varieties are not as good 
 as those they now grow. In fact, the data suggest 
 that very few farmers have had a chance to test 
 the improved OPVs now available. The data point to/show that improved OPVs have a significant produce advantage over local varieties in all VDCs, though the 
 importance varied somewhat between VDCs (Table 2). 
 Maybe sometimes (i.e., in Chauratha), the lack of 
 
 J.K. Ransom et al. I Farming-based Money flow 29 (2003) 299-305 
 
 adoption could be due to the perceived advantage of 
 improved OPVs being not enough to (give a reason to do something) change. 
 Since higher cooperating with/producing/giving up, better-changed varieties could 
 be a significant (reward or reason for doing something) for farmers to adopt new varieties, a more effort in the development of 
 the varieties is justi tied. 
 
 4. Ends/end results 
 Some ends/end results can be drawn from these 
 data (related to/looking at/thinking about) the adoption of improved OPVs in 
 Nepal. Since adoption of fertiliser is higher than the 
 adoption improved seed-the (compared to other things) cheaper, more 
 transportable input, the poor adoption of seed cannot 
 be blamed on 'remoteness' (by itself/in and of itself). Maybe, the most 
 easily seen finding of this research is the very limited exposure that farmers have had to new production 
 technologies. This shortage must be immediately 
 talked to/looked at if improvement in production and working well are to happen. Our analysis clearly points to/shows that 
 there has been limited contact between farmers and the 
 extension system in its broadest sense (including the 
 non-governmental community active in farming-based 
 development). Greater focus on exposing farmers 
 to new improved OPVs is very much needed as a first 
 step in improving adoption. The data also suggest that 
 the plan for improving adoption of new technologies in (easy to get to, use, or understand) areas may be quite different to that 
 used in remote areas. It appears that information is 
 more holding back in remote districts than in (easy to get to, use, or understand) 
 districts-in these areas seed holds back adoption. This 
 would suggest that in the (unable to be used or understood) areas, a program 
 of more intensive on-farm (acts of showing or proving) and testing 
 is immediately reasonable. On the other hand, actions 
 in (easy to get to, use, or understand) districts should focus on improving 
 the availability of improved seed. Community-based 
 seed production programs should be supported until commercial seed businesses/projects develop to fill the 
 current void. The reported 17% produce advantage of 
 improved OPV s, averaged overall VDCs, point to/show 
 that big increases in production and produc-

 tivity can be (accomplished or gained) through the use of improved 
 varieties.
