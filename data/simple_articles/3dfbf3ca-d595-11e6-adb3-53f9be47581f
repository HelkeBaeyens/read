 Abstract 
 Returns to investment in wheat breeding research in Nepal were guessed for two periods: (1) the Green 
 Revolution period (1960-1990), when modern semidwarf wheat varieties first appeared and spread throughout the 
 country, and (2) the after-Green Revolution period (after 1990), when first-generation modern varieties will be 
 replaced by newer materials. Major benefits of the Nepalese wheat breeding program have included maintenance of 
 disease resistance and faster spreading around of fancy germplasm. Attractive rates of return to investment in wheat 
 breeding have been due in part to Nepal's ability to take by force/take control of spillover benefits from close-by countries and from 
 international farming-based research centers. 
 
 1. Introduction 
 
 During the late 1960s and early 1970s, highyielding semidwarf wheats developed in Mexico 
 (referred to here as modern varieties, or MVs) 
 were introduced into some the world's 
 most crowded developing countries. When grown 
 with increased levels of (material that makes plants grow better) and an confident 
 water supply, MVs performed significantly better 
 than older materials, making possible dramatic 
 increases in wheat production and higher incomes for the millions of farmers who adopted 
 the technology. 
 The highly visible production increases connected with the introduction of MVs for many years 
 secured/made sure of a steady flow of useful things/valuable supplies to national

 wheat breeding programs. This situation changed 
 beginning in the late 1980s, when a combination 
 of money-based and political factors reduced the 
 availability of money available for farming-based research. 
 As budgets stopped expanding in real terms, research managers in many countries were 
 forced to pay greater attention to the (wasting very little while working or producing something) 
 with which useful things/valuable supplies were being used. Research 
 priority-setting procedures were often changed 
 by the introduction of needed things that proposed research projects be subjected to formal 
 money-based analysis, with the goal of creating 
 (numbers-based) a money-making state measures to help selection among different investment opportunities. 
 One country in which there is a need carefully 
 to test the returns to wheat breeding research 
 is Nepal. Even though farming represents the 
 most important part/area in Nepal's (process of people making, selling, and buying things), the 
 overall level of (government) support to agricul-

 tural research remains (compared to other things) low, averaging 
 only 0.08% of farming-based GDP during the past 
 twenty years, as compared to 0.41 % for a group 
 of 92 developing countries (Pardey, Roseboom 
 and Anderson, 1991). Because Nepal's limited 
 research useful things/valuable supplies are used to support a wide 
 range of research activities, there is a need to 
 secure/make sure of that gives money to invested in the National Wheat 
 Research Program (NWRP) create attractive 
 returns compared to alternative investment opportunities. 
 This paper reports the results of a recent study 
 carried out to guess the returns to wheat 
 breeding research in Nepal. The study had two 
 main goals: 0) to guess the returns to 
 past investment in wheat breeding in Nepal, and 
 (2) to guess the likely future returns to wheat 
 breeding in Nepal under a range of reasonable 
 ideas (you think are true) about key technical and money-based 
 limits/guidelines. The first (or most important) goal of the study was to 
 create information for use by Nepalese policy 
 makers and (people who give money or other things) in deciding the right/the proper 
 level of future money available for the national wheat 
 breeding program. 
 2. Guessing returns to farming-based research: 
 Idea-based issues 
 The rate of return to investment in farming-based 
 research is often guessed using the money-based extra approach, which suggests/says that an 
 outward (downward) move/change in the supply function 
 (named after/discovered by/caused by) (related to computers and science) change leads to an 
 increase in the money-based extra building up to producers and/or people. 1 Although early work 
 using the money-based extra approach was based 
 on overly-simple ideas (you think are true) about the supply and 
 demand functions, over time the procedures used 
 have been high-quality (in a big way). 2 Later ex1 For useful reviews of the books on testing returns to 
 investment in farming-based research, see Schuh and Tollini 
 (1978), Scobie (1978) and Norton and Davis (198l). 
 2 Progressive improvements of the basic method appear in 
 Griliches (1957, 1958), Peterson (1967), Schmitz and Seckler 
 (1970), Fishel (197l), Akino and Hayami (1975) Hayami and 
 Herdt (1977) Lindner and Jarrett (1968) Rose (1980) Wise 
 and Fell (1980) and Norton and Davis (198l). 
 
 tensions of the idea-based (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) have made 
 clear that the size and distribution among producers and people of the increase in money-based extra depends upon the shapes of the 
 supply and demand curves, as well as the nature 
 of the supply curve shift - parallel, important, or 
 come togethernt - resulting from (related to computers and science) change 
 (Voon and Edwards, 1991). Government price 
 policies have also been shown to be important in 
 deciding/figuring out the distribution of research benefits 
 (Alston, Freebairn and Edwards, 1988; Renkow, 
 1993). 
 3. Application to a plant breeding program 
 Following Brennan (1992) and Byerlee (990), 
 the money-based extra approach can be changed to fit 
 a plant breeding program. First, the benefits of 
 the breeding program are guessed as follows: 
 
 Bt = 
 
 gY;At&#126; 
 
 (1) 
 
 where B represents benefits from the breeding 
 program, g is percentage yield gain per period 
 (named after/discovered by/caused by) the breeding program, Y yield, A 
 area affected by the breeding program, W price 
 of the valuable thing, and t period. 
 Next, the internal rate of return to the research investment is calculated as the value which 
 drives the discounted stream of costs and benefits 
 to 0: 
 
 E[(Bt-Ct)/(1+IRRf] =0 
 
 (2) 
 
 where IRR represents the internal rate of return, 
 B benefits from the breeding program, and C 
 cost of the breeding program. 
 This simplified approach, which uses the 
 change in the value of production (named after/discovered by/caused by) 
 research as an guess of the change in 
 money-based extra, has two hidden (under) (serving to severely limit or control) 
 ideas (you think are true). First, it completely/in a hinting way assumes a perfectly elastic demand function, since research-caused moves/changes in the supply function do not result 
 in endogenous price changes. For a tradable valuable thing in an open (process of people making, selling, and buying things) (such as wheat in 
 Nepal), this is a reasonable idea (you think is true). Second, 
 it completely/in a hinting way assumes a perfectly inelastic supply 
 function, so that an outward (completely/in a hinting way parallel) 
 move/change in the supply function is directly translated 
 
 M.L. Morris et al. / Farming-based Money flow 10 (1994) 269-282 
 
 into a (fair in amount, related to something else/properly sized compared to something else) increase in the value of production. While this second idea (you think is true) may be 
 overly overly-simple sometimes, it probably does 
 not greatly distort the guessed benefits of wheat 
 breeding research in Nepal, where the supply 
 function for wheat is fairly inelastic because 
 Nepal's intensive cropping systems limit farmers' 
 ability to (change to make better/change to fit new conditions) wheat production in response to

 changmg pnce mcentlves. 
 Most previous applications of the money-based 
 extra approach to wheat breeding have guessed research benefits as the product of the 
 yield gains (named after/discovered by/caused by) adoption of MVs times 
 the area over which adoption happens (for 
 example, see Norton et aI., 1981; Nagy, 1983; 
 Byerlee, 1990). 4 However, in the case of the 
 Nepal, this ordinary approach is inappropriate. To understand why this is so, it is useful 
 briefly to review the history of wheat in Nepal. 
 
 4. History of wheat in Nepal: a Green Revolution 
 in three stages 
 Official statistics on wheat area, yield, and 
 production in Nepal extend back only to 1967/68 
 (Table 1). However, (even though there is the existence of) the lack of a more 
 long/big data series, statements (in court) from Nepalese 
 scientists who have been active in wheat research 
 since the early 1950s hints that the history of 
 wheat in Nepal can be divided into three stages: 
 Pre-Green Revolution period (before 1965). 
 Up until the mid-1960s, wheat was a minor 
 crop in Nepal grown mostly to provide grain 
 for home consumption and straw for animal feed. 
 Most of the varieties used were tall-heightd Indian varieties, along with local land races. Area 
 planted to wheat went up and down around 100000 ha 
 
 Guess of the price ability to stretch of supply for wheat in 
 Nepal is made hard  by the lack of reliable time series data 
 for wheat production and farm-level prices. 
 4 Depending on the approach, the yield gain may be modeled 
 either as a one-off yield gain connected with adoption of a 
 specific MV, or as an average once-a-year yield gain (accomplished or gained) over 
 time as the result of occasional replacement of older varieties by 
 newer varieties.

 Green Revolution period (J 965 to 1990). 
 Nepal's wheat part/area changed beginning in the mid-1960s with the introduction of 
 semidwarf MVs. 5 These early-maturing materials which could be collected in 115-120 days as 
 co&#126;pared to the 125-135 days needed/demanded by the 
 older, tall-heightd varieties, enabled Nepalese 
 farmers to switch from the usual rice-unplanted 
 rotation to an intensive production system in 
 which rice and wheat were double-cropped within 
 the same year. As a result, wheat area began to 
 increase quickly, rising to 600000 ha by 1990. 
 Three MVs in particular are related to 
 Nepal's Green Revolution in wheat. Lerma Rojo 
 64, the first MV grown on a large scale, was 
 introduced from Mexico in the mid-1960s and 
 soon spread to occupy over 70% of total wheat 
 area. Beginning in the late 1960s, Lerma Rojo 64 
 was replaced by another early-maturing semidwarf, RR21, which had been selected by Indian 
 wheat people (who help animals have babies) from a Mexican cross. By the late 
 
 3 
 
 Strictly speaking, some of the wheat varieties grown in 
 Nepal before the mid-1960s were also 'modern varieties' in 
 the sense that they were improved products of the Indian and 
 Mexican breeding programs. However, these older MVs can 
 be (told apart from/separate than) the semidwarf MVs introduced beginning in the mid-1960s, which enabled a sharp break in the 
 historical rate of working well growth.

 1970s, RR21 had become (able to be harmed by) foliar 
 sicknesses, and farmers began to replace it with 
 UP262, a more resistant MV developed by Indian 
 people (who help animals have babies) from Mexican parents. 
 After-Green Revolution period (after 1990). 
 The years from 1990 onward are expected to 
 become the after-Green Revolution period in 
 Nepal, when first-generation MVs will be replaced by newer MVs with increased yield (possible greatness or power) and superior disease resistance. Area (act of something getting bigger, wider, etc.) is expected to level off during this period, so 
 the main benefit of the wheat breeding effort will 
 consist of improved (related to tiny chemical assembly instructions inside of living things) (possible greatness or power). 
 
 5. Selection of the right/the proper period for analysis 
 Two periods were selected for analysis: (1) the 
 Green Revolution period (1960-1990), going along with/matching up to the years when MVs first appeared 
 and spread quickly throughout the country's major wheat-growing zones, and (2) the after-Green 
 Revolution period (1990-2020), when the original 
 MVs will be replaced by second-and third-generation MVs. While the money-based extra (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) was used to carefully study both periods, it is 
 important to note an important honor/difference: returns to wheat breeding during the Green Revolution period were guessed ex post (so that 
 most technical and money-based limits/guidelines could 
 be guessed from historical data), whereas returns to wheat breeding during the after-Green 
 Revolution period were guessed ex ante (so 
 that technical and money-based limits/guidelines had to 
 be (described the future)). 
 
 6. Returns to wheat breeding during the Green 
 Revolution period 
 Calculating the returns to wheat breeding in 
 Nepal during the Green Revolution period is 
 complicated by two factors. First, at the time of 
 their release, the early MVs did not always significantly outyield the varieties which farmers were 
 already growing. Although Lerma Rojo 64 outyielded the older, tall-heightd materials which it 
 
 replaced, when they were first released RR21 
 and UP262 did not significantly outyield Lerma 
 Rojo 64. 6 (even though there is the existence of) the lack of a clear initial yield 
 advantage, RR21 and UP262 were quickly 
 adopted by farmers because of other desirable 
 (features/ qualities/ traits) - early maturity, bold grain type, 
 and white grain color in the case of RR21, and 
 disease resistance in the case of UP262. Only 
 later when older materials became (able to be harmed by) 
 foliar sicknesses and suffered declines in (related to tiny chemical assembly instructions inside of living things) 
 potential did yield differences come out, most (in an obvious way) between UP262 and RR21. Second, the 
 MVs which (totally changed and improved) wheat production in 
 Nepal probably would have been adopted eventually even had there been no national wheat program. Because Nepal's principal wheat-growing 
 area is touching with a (related to the Earth's weather)ally almost the same 
 wheat-growing belt in India, and because many 
 Nepalese farmers have frequent contacts with 
 Indian farmers (often they are related), wheat 
 seed regularly crosses the border. So, even if 
 the NWRP had not been active in testing, 
 releasing, and (helping increase/showing in a good way) Mexican and Indian 
 materials, many of these materials probably would 
 have entered Nepal anyway through farmer-tofarmer seed exchanges. 
 Because of these unusual features of the Green 
 Revolution in Nepal, it was necessary to figure out 
 unusual methods for guessing two key 
 limits/guidelines needed/demanded by the money-based extra approach: yield gains (named after/discovered by/caused by) wheat breeding, and area affected by wheat research. 
 Yield gains (named after/discovered by/caused by) wheat breeding 
 Since at the time of their release the MVs 
 connected with the Green Revolution in Nepal 
 did not always significantly outyield farmers' current varieties, (related to tiny chemical assembly instructions inside of living things) gains due to breeding cannot be calculated using the ordinary 'vintage 
 model' approach, which assumes that newly released MVs outyield the older materials they are 
 designed to replace. Instead, (related to tiny chemical assembly instructions inside of living things) gains (understood/made real/achieved) as a result of MV adoption must be esti-

 MVs at the time of their introduction, see Basnyat (1967) and

 mated as yield losses previous/unavoidable, under the idea (you think is true) that yields in farmers' fields would have 
 declined as a result of increasing disease pressure 
 had the older (able to be harmed) varieties not been replaced. 7 
 The yield losses previous/unavoidable in Nepal because of 
 varietal replacement (specifically, replacement of 
 RR21 by UP262; Lerma Rojo 64 was dropped 
 from NWRP varietal trials in the late 1960s because it had mostly disappeared from farmers' 
 fields) were guessed using 15 years of trial data 
 from six farming-based research stations. 8 The following function was guessed using OLS moving backward ways of doing things: 
 
 In Y;j,

 where Y represents yield of variety i (RR21 or 
 UP262), T time (popular thing/general way things are going), D intercept-shifting 
 dummy (number or thing that changes) on variety UP262, DT slopeshifting dummy (number or thing that changes) on variety UP262, S 
 dummy (numbers that change/things that change) for places/locations j, and u error term.

 These results are important in a few respects. First, the coefficient on the time (popular thing/general way things are going) (T) 
 is negative and highly significant, pointing to/showing that 
 over the past 15 years, yields of RR21 (lowered in number/got worse/gotten worse) at 
 an average once-a-year rate of 6.8% (Fig. 1). This 
 striking rate of decline appears to be due to 
 increasing leaf rust and Helminthosporium leaf 
 disease (chance of being harmed), as well as crop and useful thing/valuable supply 
 management problems on the research farms 
 where the trials were managed and did/done. 9 Second, the 
 coefficient on the intercept-shifting dummy (number or thing that changes) (D) is not very different from zero. 
 This confirms that at the time of its introduction, 
 UP262 offered no significant produce advantage 
 compared to RR21. Third, the coefficient on the 
 slope-shifting (related to multiplying numbers) dummy (number or thing that changes) (DT) 
 is positive and significant, pointing to/showing that over the 
 past 15 years yields of UP262 have (lowered in number/got worse/gotten worse) about 2.5% per year more slowly than yields 
 of RR21. Since the two varieties received identical management in the experiment-station trials 
 from which the yield data were drawn, the only 
 explanation for the faster rate of yield decline of 
 RR21 is its higher level of (chance of being harmed by) foliar 
 germs.

 The idea that MVs offer increased protection against sicknesses runs opposite to what people believe now, which hints that traditional wheat varieties gave/given superior resistance (for example, see Shiva, 1991; Conway and Barbier, 
 1990; Berg et aI., 1991; Hobbelink, 1991). In fact, before the 
 Green Revolution losses to sicknesses were often big in 
 many major wheat-growing areas of South Asia (Byerlee, 
 1994). The MVs connected with Nepal's Green Revolution in 
 wheat greatly reduced the risk of disease losses by incorporating resistance (tiny chemical assembly instructions inside of living things)  identified over the course of more than 
 20 years of research in Mexico and in other places. 
 8 Use of farm-level yield data would have been better, but 
 unfortunately such data were not available over an extended 
 period. Use of experiment-station data is (done for good reason) by the fact 
 that varietal trials in Nepal are managed and did/done using levels of important 
 inputs (e.g., (material that makes plants grow better) and crop-watering/rinsing with water) like those used by 
 farmers. 
 7 
 
 273 
 
 Area affected by wheat research 
 
 Under the money-based extra approach, the area 
 affected by a plant breeding program can be 
 measured either indirectly (in the form of a shift 
 in the supply curve, which completely/in a hinting way reflects 
 changes in area planted) or directly (by guessing the rate of adoption of MVs and applying this 
 rate of adoption to the area planted to the crop). 
 A direct approach was used in this study. However, use of the ordinary method would have 
 (described something as less than it was) the hit/effect of the Green Revolution 
 in Nepal, where the introduction of early-maturing MVs in and of itself helped/encouraged a significant 
 (act of something getting bigger, wider, etc.) in wheat area which would not other- 
 
 Nepalese wheat scientists, extension agents, and farmers 
 report that a almost the same  declining yield (popular thing/general way things are going) has also been 
 watched/followed in farmers' fields. However, this effect is hid/hidden in 
 national average yield data because farmers, unlike (people who work to find information), have been applying increasing amounts of (material that makes plants grow better) 
 and other inputs to make up for (lowering in number/getting worse) (related to tiny chemical assembly instructions inside of living things) (possible greatness or power).

 wise have happened. Therefore, Nepal's wheat 
 area was disaggregated into two parts/pieces: a 
 'base area' which probably would have been 
 planted to wheat even if early-maturing MVs had 
 not been introduced (guessed by applying a 3% 
 once-a-year long-term growth rate to the area planted 
 to wheat before 1968, the year in which wheat 
 area began to expand quickly), and an 'incremental area' which was planted to wheat only because 
 of the appearance of MVs (Fig. 2). 
 Different methods were used to guess the 
 benefits of breeding research in each of the two 
 areas. Since the (in small steps up) area by definition 
 was not planted to wheat before the appearance 
 of MVs, the benefits to wheat breeding over the 
 (in small steps up) area could not be guessed in the 
 same way as for the base area (i.e., based on the 
 difference between the yield of old varieties and 
 MVs). Because the appearance of MVs made 
 wheat production possible on land which (before that/before now) had been left unplanted, a different measure of 
 value-added was needed to guess the benefits. 
 So, the benefits on the (in small steps up) area were 
 guessed as the net returns per hectare of wheat 
 production (defined as gross returns minus fixed 
 and changeable costs). No opportunity cost was de- 
 
 ducted from the net returns figure to pay 
 for the displacement of competing crops, since 
 farmers expanded wheat area by using land (before that/before now) left unplanted. 10 
 Not enough data were available to allow separate calculation of net returns to wheat production in every year throughout the period of analysis (1960-1990), so it was necessary to make the 
 simplifying idea (you think is true) that net returns have remained constant in real terms over the past three 
 20 years. 11 Net returns per hectare of wheat production were guessed for 1982-83 based on 
 crop budgets published by the Nepal Ministry of 
 Farming and projected back over the life of 
 the research program. Expressed in 1990 Rupees, 
 net returns averaged Rs 2000jha for improved, 
 
 10 Although it probably would have been desirable to (change to make better/change to fit new conditions) 
 the net returns figure to account for long-term costs possibly 
 connected with the (process by which something becomes stronger or worse) of the cropping system 
 (e.g., speeded up rate of soil life-creating ability decline, increased pressure on ground water supplies), this was not done, since it 
 was not known how to number such costs. 
 11 It is important to note that this is not the same as assuming 
 that the price of wheat remained constant throughout the 
 period - which it did not.

 partially watered wheat in the Mid-hills and Rs 
 2500/ha for improved watered wheat in the 
 Terai). 12 
 Benefits over the base area were guessed 
 using the ordinary method of multiplying the 
 (related to tiny chemical assembly instructions inside of living things) gains (named after/discovered by/caused by) MVs (in this case, 
 the yield losses previous/unavoidable) times the area planted 
 to MVs. 13 However, as pointed out earlier, even 
 had there been no national wheat program in 
 Nepal, MV adoption probably would have happened anyway as the result of farmer-to-farmer 
 seed exchanges along the India-Nepal border. 
 Since the real hit/effect of the NWRP was to speed up the rate of adoption, the area affected by 
 the Nepalese wheat breeding program was modeled as the difference between the actual historical MV adoption pattern and the possible 
 adoption pattern which likely would have won without the NWRP (Fig. 3). 
 Limits/guidelines of the actual historical adoption pattern (modeled as a logistic curve) were guessed 
 based on information given by full of knowledge 
 Nepalese wheat scientists about the spread of 
 MVs, helped by data from producer surveys carried out during the past thirty years. 14 
 Limits/guidelines of the possible 'without research' 
 adoption pattern were guessed based on the 
 rate of adoption of Indian varieties which were 
 never released in Nepal but which came in over 
 the border. Separate adoption curves were guessed under both 'with research' and 'without 
 research' pictures/situations for the two main wheat-growing zones, Terai and Mid-hills, with adoption 
 taking longer in the Mid-hills due to the lack of 
 transportation and communication (set of machines). 
 Ceiling adoption levels were conservatively assumed to be 80% for both zones, even though 
 recent surveys suggest that the adoption of MVs 
 
 in the Terai is now approaching 100% (Harrington et aI., 1992). 
 Other limits/guidelines used in the ex post analysis 
 Average once-a-year wheat prices at the farm level, 
 (changed to make better/changed to fit new conditions) for inflation, were used in valuing the 
 research benefits (both the extra production (named after/discovered by/caused by) speeded up adoption of MVs over 
 the base area, as well as the production from the 
 (in small steps up) area). 
 Three categories of research expenses were 
 included on the cost side: (1) the NWRP budget, 
 (2) the budgets of the eleven research farms 
 where wheat research happens, and (3) wheat 
 research costs of scientists working in the (related to control or punishment) divisions in the Ministry of Farming. 
 The three categories were disaggregated into 
 breeding and breeding support costs, seed production costs, and other research costs (e.g., crop 
 management research costs). 
 Based on guesses made by NWRP people (who help animals have babies) 
 about the length of time involved in (examining and testing so a decision can be made), 
 selecting, testing, and releasing a new wheat variety, a research lag of eight years was assumed, 
 meaning that eight years of research costs were 
 got/caused before the release of the first MV. 
 Using the limits/guidelines summarized in Table 2, 
 the IRR to wheat breeding in Nepal during the 
 Green Revolution period (1960-1990) was guessed as 84%. This figure includes returns to 
 wheat breeding and breeding support activities, 
 as well as to seed production activities carried out

 MV adoption were guessed to be larger in the Terai than in 
 the Mid-hills.

 on farming-based research stations by staff of the 
 wheat breeding program. This guessed IRR, 
 while high by ordinary investment judging requirements, 
 falls within the range of IRRS reported in other 
 recent studies of the of returns to investment in 
 wheat research (Table 3). 
 
 7. Returns to wheat breeding during the postGreen Revolution period 
 
 As Nepal enters into the after-Green Revolution period, Nepalese policy makers must decide 
 the right/the proper level of money available for future wheat 
 research. Although past investment in wheat research in Nepal has created attractive rates of 
 return, a few of the key limits/guidelines which added/gave to large benefits in the past can be 
 expected to change. Especially, the fast (act of something getting bigger, wider, etc.) in area planted to wheat resulting from 
 the introduction of early maturing varieties can 
 be expected to slow as remaining plantable land is 
 brought under (producing crops/helping something grow). Also, as average 
 wheat yields continue to rise, future rates of yield 
 gain can be expected to slow down. 
 Unlike ex post analysis, which is based on 
 historical events, ex ante analysis needs/demands making 
 (statements about the future) about the future. Given the uncer- 
 
 277 
 
 dirtyy built into (describing the future) what is going to 
 happen in farmers' fields, returns to investment 
 in wheat research in Nepal during the after-Green 
 Revolution period were guessed under a set of 
 very conservative (a measure of what occurs naturally/sports boundary line) ideas (you think are true) concerning likely future yield gains, varietal adoption 
 rates, and increases in wheat area. These ideas (you think are true) were then in a planned way relaxed, and sensitivity analysis was carried out to decide/figure out how 
 the returns respond to changes in the limits/guidelines. 
 Key limits/guidelines used in the (a measure of what occurs naturally/sports boundary line) ex ante 
 analysis are described below. 
 Area affected by wheat research 
 As Nepal enters the after-Green Revolution 
 period and opportunities for further (process by which something becomes stronger or worse) are exhausted, (act of something getting bigger, wider, etc.) in wheat area can 
 be expected to slow. In the (a measure of what occurs naturally/sports boundary line) picture/situation, 
 future wheat area was assumed to remain constant at current levels of 250000 ha in the Midhills and 350000 ha in the Terai. The last thing just mentioned 
 idea (you think is true) in particular is very conservative, since 
 now only about one-third of the rice area in 
 the Terai is rotated with wheat. As (set of machines) 
 improves (especially crop-watering/rinsing with water), wheat area in the 
 Terai will likely increase a lot. Under the 
 conservative idea (you think is true) that no further (act of something getting bigger, wider, etc.) in area will happen, the area affected by wheat 
 research will be the area planted to MVs sooner 
 than would have happened without a 
 Nepalese wheat research program. This area was 
 calculated as the difference between the same 
 'with research' and 'without research' adoption 
 curves used in the ex post analysis. 
 Expected future growth in wheat yields 
 Although past yield gains (named after/discovered by/caused by) adoption of MVs were guessed as 2.5% per year, 
 there is no reason to assume that a almost the same  rate 
 will necessarily be (accomplished or gained) during the after-Green 
 Revolution period. Therefore, instead of simply 
 predicting past (related to tiny chemical assembly instructions inside of living things) gains into the future, 
 possible future yield gains were guessed based 
 on the performance of germplasm which is now in the pipeline - MVs which have been 
 tested, selected, and released for distribution to 
 farmers, but which have not yet been widely 
 adopted. 
 
 278 
 
 M.L. Morris et al. / Farming-based Money flow 10 (1994) 269-282 
 
 The possible rate of future yield gains was 
 guessed through use of a old/original model using 
 data from varietal trials carried out at six research stations in the Terai during 1978-1990. 
 Eight varieties representing six wines were included, representing the now most in control/most common variety (UP262), as well as all later releases for 
 which trial data are available. 15 Because the data 
 set was unbalanced, the leftover/extra maximum chance (REML) guess method was chosen in 
 order to improve the quality of the 
 guesses. 16,17 The old/original model was specified 
 as follows: 
 ( 4) 
 
 where Yijt is yield of variety i in site j in trial year 
 t, m grand mean, Vi fixed effect for variety i, Yt 
 fixed effect for trial year t, (s /Y)j random effect 
 for site j, and u random error term. 
 (described the future) mean varietal yields were then moved backward against year of release (old/original) using a 
 log-linear creation to guess the average 
 once-a-year rate of yield gains in varieties released 
 since 1978 (Fig. 4), This rate was guessed as 
 g = 1.25%, which may be understood/explained as the potential future rate of yield gains. In the (a measure of what occurs naturally/sports boundary line) 
 picture/situation, future wheat yields were projected from 
 current levels of 1.25 tjha in the Mid-hills and 
 1.6 t/ha in the Terai using this once-a-year rate of 
 increase. In the sensitivity analysis, a few alter- 
 
 15 The number of varieties is greater than the number of 
 wines because in a few years more than one variety was 
 released. 
 16 This often-already-met problem results from the way 
 varietal yield trials are carried out: promising new varieties 
 are occasionally added to a trial, kept/held for some changeable 
 length of time, and eventually dropped when they no longer 
 perform as well as later introductions. Although one or two 
 check varieties may be kept/held throughout the length of time of a 
 trial, (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) for most of the varieties wiJl be available 
 only for a limited number of years, resulting in an unbalanced 
 data set no good for OLS guess procedures. 
 17 The old/original model was guessed using the Leftover/extra Maximum Chance (REML) software package developed by the 
 Scottish Farming-based Statistics Service at the University of 
 Edinburgh. 
 
 native future rates of yield increases (both higher 
 and lower) were carefully thought about/believed. 
 Other limits/guidelines used in the ex ante analysis 
 
 In the (a measure of what occurs naturally/sports boundary line) picture/situation, the future real price 
 of wheat was assumed to remain constant at 
 current levels of 5000 Rs/t. The marketing margin was also assumed to remain constant at current levels of 25% of the personal prices. In the 
 sensitivity analysis, changes in both the retail 
 price and the marketing margin were carefully thought about/believed. 
 In the (a measure of what occurs naturally/sports boundary line) picture/situation, future investment in 
 wheat breeding research was assumed to remain 
 constant in real terms at current levels of 1.2 
 million Rupees. It was assumed that Nepalese 
 wheat scientists spend an average of eight years 
 (examining and testing so a decision can be made) and selecting imported materials between the release of each successful variety. In 
 other words, eight years of research costs are 
 got/caused before the (understanding/achieving a goal) of benefits through 
 adoption. In the sensitivity analysis, changes in 
 the length of the research lag were carefully thought about/believed. 
 Using the limits/guidelines summarized in Table 4, 
 the IRR to future investment in wheat research in 
 Nepal was guessed as 49%. 18 This figure includes returns to wheat breeding and breeding 
 support activities, as well as seed production activities carried out on the research stations by 
 staff of the wheat breeding program. This projected IRR is lower than the past rate of returns 
 for two reasons. First, the big expansion in 
 wheat area attributed to the introduction of MVs 
 during the Green Revolution period is projected 
 to slow. Second, future rates of yield gain (named after/discovered by/caused by) the replacement of older MVs by 
 newer MVs is expected to be more modest than 
 in the past. 
 Sensitivity analysis 
 
 In order to test the strength of the projected rates of return, the values of many of the 
 key limits/guidelines used in guessing the (a measure of what occurs naturally/sports boundary line) 
 
 18 Research costs and benefits were projected for the period 
 1990-2020. Beyond 30 years into the future, the present value 
 of costs and benefits becomes very small due to the effects of 
 discounting.

 research will be much more sensitive to some 
 limits/guidelines than to others. (compared to other things) large 
 changes in the projected price of wheat and in 
 the size of the marketing margin will have modest 
 effects on the projected IRR, pointing to/showing that returns to wheat breeding will not be highly sensitive to changes in the world price of wheat. 
 (in almost the same way), the projected IRR is (compared to other things) insensitive to changes in the projected rate of growth in 
 wheat area, the projected rate of growth in wheat 
 produces /gives up attributable to research, and to the projected adoption ceiling. On the other hand, the 
 projected IRR is moderately sensitive to the research lag (i.e., the length of the period of research investment coming before the release of each

 during the past thirty years. This attractive rate 
 of return is explained by the small 
 cost of the Nepalese wheat research program in 
 relation to the big benefits it creates. 
 On the cost side, NWRP has been able to take 
 advantage of close links with the Indian wheat 
 research program and with CIMMYT in taking (prisoners) by force big benefits in the form of fancy 
 germplasm which is generally well designed to 
 production conditions in Nepal; by (examining and testing so a decision can be made) and 
 selecting superior materials coming out of these 
 programs, Nepalese wheat scientists have been 
 able to release a few highly successful varieties 
 while managing to avoid a big part of/amount of 
 the expenses involved in their development. On 
 the benefit side, two main factors can be identified as having added/gave to the success of the 
 Nepalese wheat research effort. The first generation of MVs released in Nepal, especially RR21, 
 fueled a big increase in wheat area due to 
 their early maturity, which made possible 
 
 double-cropping of wheat and rice in areas where - 
 farmers had (before that/before now) been restricted to one 
 crop per year. (after that), the replacement of 
 RR21 by UP262 and other newer varieties en- " 
 abled farmers to avoid yield losses due to a 
 breakdown in disease resistance. Experimental 
 data suggest that failure to replace RR21 would 
 have resulted in disease-related yield losses of 
 2.5% per year. 
 Although (act of something getting bigger, wider, etc.) in wheat area can be expected to slow in coming years, returns to wheat 
 breeding research in Nepal will remain attractive 
 under a wide range of reasonable money-based and 
 technical limits/guidelines. Under a (a measure of what occurs naturally/sports boundary line) picture/situation 
 in which future investment in wheat breeding is 
 assumed to remain constant (in real terms) at 
 current levels, the IRR is projected to reach 49%. 
 Significantly, expected future benefits from wheat 
 research are based only on the improved 
 yield potential already present in (not very long ago)-released materials, (in other words), assuming no future benefits 
 from disease resistance. To the extent that regular varietal replacement will enable farmers to 
 continue to avoid yield losses due to the breakdown in disease resistance of older varieties (the 
 main source of benefits in the past), future returns could be much higher. 
 These findings can be taken as a strong support for continued investment in wheat 
 breeding research in Nepal. Although future returns cannot be expected to reach the amazing rates (accomplished or gained) in the past, they will remain 
 very attractive by ordinary investment 
 judging requirements. However, the desirable balance between 
 breeding and crop management research will 
 probably change over time. While the benefits 
 (understood/made real/achieved) during the Green Revolution period resulted mainly from the adoption of improved 
 germplasm, (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) of (lowering in number/getting worse) yields both at 
 the farm level as well as on experiment stations 
 hints that crop and useful thing/valuable supply management 
 problems will assume increasing importance in 
 the future. 
 More generally, the results of this study point to/show that it may be clear to establish plant 
 breeding programs for valuable things planted over 
 limited areas if such breeding programs can help 
 farmers in (taking by force)/(taking control of) research spillovers emanat- 
 
 M.L. Morris et al. / Farming-based Money flow 10 (1994) 269-282 
 
 ing in other places (e.g., being close to countries, inter- 
 
 - national farming-based research centers, the private 
 
 part/area). Although supporting a fully-developed 
 breeding program may not be warranted in cases 
 where benefits are expected to be modest, maintaining the ability to speed the selection and 
 spreading around of imported germplasm can be 
 highly desirable on money-based grounds (Brennan, 
 1992; Maredia, 1993). This end/end result would appear to be especially (connected/related) for smaller countries which are struggling to maintain fully developed breeding programs for major crops in the 
 face of (lowering in number/getting worse) levels of money available for farming-based 
 research, as well as for larger countries which 
 must decide what to do about minor crops.
