 Abstract 
 A double hurdle model of off-farm work participation and off-farm labour income was received/made from and guessed consistent 
 with a farm household model. It was found that restricting and unexpected transaction costs stop farm families from 
 participating in off-farm work. The 1992 and the (list of things to deal with/desire to reach a goal) 2000 CAP changes are most likely to increase the off-farm 
 employment of plantable farm families, but its full effect cannot happen/be made real because of fears to enter off-farm activities. 
 Household and farm (features/ qualities/ traits) have different hits/effects on off-farm work participation and on the level of off-farm labour 
 income. Â© 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

 1. Introduction 
 
 The 1992 (related to Europe) Union (EU) common farming-based policy (CAP) reform has changed the relative 
 role of price support and direct income support in 
 plantable farming (Oude Lansink and Peerlings, 1996). It 
 reduced the price support for cereals and stopped the 
 shortage payments for oilseeds. Instead (making up for something/paying for something) land payments which act as direct income 
 support were introduced. A further reduction in price 
 support in combination with increased (making up for something/paying for something) 
 land payments will happen in 2000 and 2001 as 
 a result of the decisions taken on (list of things to deal with/desire to reach a goal) 2000 
 ((related to Europe) Union, 1999).

 These policy changes may affect the labour portion offarmers between farm and off-farm activities. It 
 may also encourage farmers to (branch out into different things) their income 
 sources (Hill, 1996). In a farm household, labour is 
 gave out between farm and off-farm work such that 
 the not important value of farm labour equals the wage rate 
 of off-farm work (Becker, 1965; Gronau, 1973). Books in off-farm work also points to/shows (see Hallberg et 
 al., 1991) that farm families' off-farm work decision is dependent on location, farm and non-farm 
 income, and family and (money-related) (features/ qualities/ traits) (Woman 
 et al., 1991). It is inversely related to farm income 
 because of a substitution and income effect. Nonlabour incomes such as income from valuable things, social 
 security benefits, and direct income support reduce 
 off-farm employment due to an income effect only. 
 As a result, a change in government policy due to 
 either a price policy or direct income support (e.g.

 coming from the 1992 and (list of things to deal with/desire to reach a goal) 2000 CAP 
 changes) may affect the desire of farm families 
 to participate in off-farm work. 
 However, in the presence of restricting and transaction costs in the labour market, the not important value of 
 farm labour and the wage rate of off-farm work may 
 not be equal. In such cases, families cannot execute 
 their desired plan to work off their farm (Deaton and 
 Irish, 1984; Blundell and Meghir, 1987). So the 
 possible effect of the CAP changes on off-farm work 
 may not be fully (understood/made real/achieved). 
 Capital and technology employed by a farm household, person's age and education can have either a 
 negative or positive effect on the desire of farm families to parncipate in off-farm work as they affect 
 both farm and off-farm employment (Woman  et al., 1991). 
 More than that, the relative importance of these factors may 
 differ across families (Woman  et al., 1991). Although 
 well recorded/supported for North America (see, for example, Hallberg et al., 1991), books on off-farm work 
 is rare/not enough  for the Netherlands and Europe as a whole. 
 What's more, previous studies made on off-farm work 
 (Olfert, 1993; Kimhi, 1994, 1996; Hearn et al., 1996; 
 Kimhi and Lee, 1996; Mishra and Goodwin, 1997; 
 Tavernier et al., 1997; Weersink et al., 1998) do not 
 think about/believe restricting in the off-farm labour market. 
 The goals of this study are therefore (1) to 
 (ask lots of questions about/try to find the truth about) the effect of farm and non-labour income 
 on the off-farm work decision and decide/figure out the effects/results/suggestions of the 1992 and (list of things to deal with/desire to reach a goal) 2000 CAP changes; (2) 
 to (ask lots of questions about/try to find the truth about) the role of other (things that decide other things) of offfarm work; and (3) to test if Dutch plantable farm families are actually stopped by restricting and unexpected 
 transaction costs to enter off-farm activities. 
 Off-farm work participation and off-farm labour 
 income are modelled agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with a farm household 
 model (Singh et al., 1986; Huffman, 1991). More than that, 
 this paper uses a double hurdle model (Deaton and 
 Irish, 1984; Blundell and Meghir, 1987) and generalised Tobit model (Amemiya, 1984) in which the 
 participation decision and off-farm labour income 
 are both/together guessed using a maximum chance 
 estimator (MLE). 
 The rest of the paper is organised as follows. In the 
 next section, explanation and model (detailed descriptions of exactly what is required) are 
 discussed. In Section 3, the data and guess methods are described. Section 4 discusses the results. 
 Section 5 presents the ends/end results. 
 
 2. Explanation and model (detailed description of exactly what is required) 
 Off-farm employment of a farm household, using 
 off-farm labour income as a substitute, can be treated as a 
 hidden/covered up (number or thing that changes), which may be watched/followed when a household has a desire to participate in off-farm work and is 
 able to find a job in the labour market. In an farming-based household model an person is willing to 
 participate in off-farm work when his reservation 
 wage Cwr;) is less than the off-farm wage Cwm;) net 
 of commuting and expected transaction costs. 
 The participation decision of a household to work 
 outside his farm (D;), can therefore be modelled as 
 follows: 
 D; 
 
 = { 1 &#126;f 
 
 0 1f 
 
 Wri 
 
 &amp;lt; Wmi

 Pr(D;= 1) = { Pr(U(n;(-),wm;,V;,Pc,a;) &amp;gt; 0) 
 Pr(cx'X;) &amp;gt; -u;; U; rv N(O, 1) 
 
 (1) 
 
 where the chance of a farmer to participate in offfarm labour (Pr(-)) is assumed to depend on n(-) (farm 
 profit\ Wm; (the market wage rate), v (non-labour 
 income), Pc (price of consumption goods), and a; 
 (household (features/ qualities/ traits)); L 0 is off-farm labour ; 
 X is a column vector of (numbers that change/things that change) that affect the 
 reservation and market wage; ex' is a row vector of 
 limits/guidelines; u; is the error term of the participation 
 decision. The hidden/covered up (number or thing that changes) off-farm labour income 
 (Y*) and watched/followed off-farm labour income (Y) can be 
 specified as 
 Yt

 1 Farm (money made/good thing received) is included in both the participation equation (1) 
 and the off-farm labour income equation (2). The understood 
 idea (you think is true) that is made here is that both functions are separatable 
 in all elements of n(-) (i.e. land, labour, capital and netput prices) 
 and Wmi- Pc and a,. The separability idea (you think is true) that is made with 
 respect to labour is very bad/extreme, since it is assumed that the 
 tax rate of substitution of labour with capital and netput 
 prices is independent of the market wage rate.

 2.1. Independent models 
 The ordinary Tobit model assumes that the same 
 (random/including random data points) process affects both the participation decision and off-farm labour income. A zero (understanding/achieving a goal) for 
 a (thing that changes (like a test score) because of something else that you control (like study time)) represents a corner solution or a 
 negative value for the hidden (under) hidden/covered up dependent 
 (number or thing that changes) (Cragg, 1971; Lin and Schmidt, 1984 ). When 
 a Tobit model is taken from the idea (you think is true) that the 
 error term of the participation equation and the hidden/covered up 
 (number or thing that changes) are related, it is called generalised Tobit 
 model (Amemiya, 1984, pp. 29-33). 
 Even if farm families are willing to participate in 
 off-farm work, however, restricting in the labour market (Deaton and Irish, 1984; Blundell and Meghir, 
 1987) and unexpected transaction costs such as search 
 costs, information and other costs may stop them to 
 participate in off-farm work. In the presence of (fear/stopping of behavior) to join the off-farm activities, therefore, a doublehurdle model would be more appropriate than an 
 ordinary Tobit model (Cragg, 1971; Blundell and 
 Meghir, 1987, p. 197). The double hurdle model takes 
 into account that people have to pass two hurdles 
 to participate in off-farm work: they have to develop 
 the want to participate in off-farm work and pass the 
 (fear/stopping of behavior) to join the labour market. If the relationship 
 between the error terms in the participation decision 
 and off-farm labour income is assumed to be zero, 
 then the model is called independent double hurdle 
 model or in short the model of Cragg (1971). In 
 contrast, if the independence idea (you think is true) for the 
 error terms of the participation decision and off-farm 
 labour income is relaxed, it is called dependent double 
 hurdle model (Deaton and Irish, 1984; Blundell and 
 Meghir, 1987). 
 Following the lines of Maddala (1983), Amemiya 
 (Amemiya, 1984, p. 9) and Blundell and Meghir 
 (Blundell and Meghir, 1987, p. 181 ), the log chance 
 function of the Tobit model can be written as: 
 
 logL= 
 
 &#126; [-log CTe +logÂ¢ (Y; &#126;:'X;)]_) 
 
 summary over (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) with positive watched/followed 
 off-farm labour income, and &amp;lt;D(-) and Â¢0 refer to the 
 standard (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) chance and density functions, 
 (match up each pair of items in order). 
 In the independent double hurdle model, the chance that income (Y) is zero is the product of 
 chance that the hidden/covered up (number or thing that changes) off-farm labour 
 income (Y*) is negative and the chance that 
 Y* is positive. In this case, there is an (fear/stopping of behavior) to 
 carry out the want to join the labour market. 
 As a result, the log chance function for the 
 independent double hurdle model is given by 
 Blundell and Meghir (Blundell and Meghir, 1987, 
 p. 186): 
 logL= 
 
 ;;=log[1-&amp;lt;D(p&#126;&#126;;)&amp;lt;D(a'X;)]_) 
 + 
 
 L 
 
 [-log CTe +logÂ¢ 
 
 + 
 
 (Y;- 
 
 P'X;) 
 
 CTe 
 
 +log&amp;lt;D(a'X;)l 
 
 (4) 
 
 When &amp;lt;D(a'X;) equals one, the independent double 
 hurdle model reduces to a standard Tobit model. Since 
 the Tobit model is nested into the independent double 
 hurdle model (Lin and Schmidt, 1984), a chance 
 ratio test can be used (Greene, 1993, p. 701) to 
 scientifically test if farm families are actually stopped to enter in the off-farm activities. 
 
 2.2. Dependent models 
 Relaxing the independence idea (you think is true), the two 
 error terms (u; and e;) are assumed to be combined (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) 
 with variance-covariance matrix: 
 (5) 
 
 Then Eqs. (1) and (2) can be written as (Amemiya, 
 1984, pp. 31-32; Blundell and Meghir, 1987, p. 187), 
 (match up each pair of items in order): 
 
 &#126;log(1-&amp;lt;D(P&#126;&#126;;)) 
 + 
 
 165 
 
 (3) 
 
 Yt = 
 
 P'X; + PCTeUi + e;, 
 
 Pr(D; = 1) = Pr(a'X; + 
 where the subscript 0 points to/shows summary over (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) with zero off-farm labour income,+ points to/shows 
 
 u; 
 
 &amp;gt; 0). 
 
 (6) 
 
 It follows that the log chance of the generalised 
 Tobit can be rewritten as:

 3. Data and guess

 When p is zero, it reduces to the model of Cragg 
 (1971), if &amp;lt;1&amp;gt;(1X1X) is one it reduces to a generalised 
 Tobit model (Amemiya, 1984), whereas, if p is zero 
 and &amp;lt;1&amp;gt;(1X1X) equals one, it reduces to a standard Tobit 
 model. 
 Explanatory (numbers that change/things that change) (X's) were chosen to be 
 expected short-run farm (money made/good thing received), on-farm labour supplied by the head of the household and other family 
 members, land, capital, time, non-labour income such 
 as such as income from valuable things, social security benefits; 
 household (features/ qualities/ traits) such as age, education dummies, and family size, macroeconomics conditions 
 such as the personal price index and average market 
 wage rates. All (numbers that change/things that change) except expected short-run 
 farm (money made/good thing received) are assumed to be (coming from the outside of something). These (numbers that change/things that change) affect both the reservation wage rate and the 
 market wage rate, and can be came/coming from an farming-based household model (Huffman, 1991). 
 Expected short-run farm (money made/good thing received) has been received/made from 
 from a (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy)ised quadratic profit function (may or may not happen, depending on something) on fixed inputs. It was assumed that output 
 prices were not known at the time decisions were 
 made on planting. Because of this, expected rather than (understood/made real/achieved) prices were used. Expected output prices were 
 built by applying an AR(l) filter to the price of 
 output. To (force (on people)/cause an inconvenient situation) linear evenness the profit function is (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy)ised by the price of output (Thijssen, 
 1992, p. 31). The (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy)ised quadratic short-run (money made/good thing received) 
 
 Data on (focused on doing one thing very well) plantable farms, covering the 
 period 1971/72-1992/93, come from a layered sample of farms keeping accounts for the LEIDLO farm accounting system2 . In total 912 individual 
 farms forming an unbalanced panel of 4110 (instance of watching, noticing, or making a statement) were used for the analysis. Summary statistics of 
 the data used are given in Table 1. A more described/explained 
 description of the sample used in this study can be 
 found in LEI-DLO (1992). 
 Family labour makes up/is equal to 88% of total labour used 
 on the farm, whereas hired labour makes up for the 
 remaining 12%. 37% of the (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) reported no 
 use of hired labour at all. Out of the sample, 47% of the 
 farms have positive off-farm labour income. What's more, out of the 4110 (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements), 65% ofthem have 
 medium and higher level farming-based education, 22% 
 of them have lower level farming-based education and 
 2.7% of them have general education. 
 Expected short-run farm (money made/good thing received) was serious and stubborn as 
 the expected price of output times output amount 
 minus the value of changeable inputs. There is one output 
 (composed of cereals, sugar red vegetable, potatoes and other 
 outputs) and one changeable input (fertiliser, seeds, bug-killers, hired labour and other (number or thing that changes) inputs). Tornqvist price indices (at 1980/81 prices) were calculated

 Institute to make the data available for this research is thankfully 
 admitted/recognized.

 for the compound (numbers that change/things that change) (i.e. output and changeable 
 inputs). Price indices change/differ  over the years but not over 
 the farms, suggesting that the difference in the composition of the output/input or quality differences are 
 reflected in the amount. Understood input and output 
 amount indices were gotten as the ratio of value and 
 the price indices. Therefore, amounts are measured at 
 constant 1980/81 prices. The market wage rate is the 
 wage rate of hired labour in plantable farming and is 
 received/got from the LEI-DLO. Household budgets are 
 calculated using the sum of guessed farm (money made/good things received) and 
 non-labour income data from the LEI-DLO. All prices 
 and (money made/good thing received) were (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy)ised by the expected price of 
 output. 
 Labour is measured in hours worked on the farm 
 and is reported by the farmers in the LEI-DLO 
 accounting system; capital represents capital invested 
 in machinery and animals and is measured at 1980/81 
 prices; land represents the (helped to grow) area on the farm 
 and is measured in ares. Other (numbers that change/things that change) included in 
 the profit function are a weather index to correct for 
 weather influences and a time (popular thing/general way things are going) to account for 
 (related to computers and science) change. 
 The expected short-run farm profit function is guessed using a random effects estimator after an OLS 
 estimator was rejected (see also Greene, 1993, pp. 
 479-480). A random effect estimator was also used for 
 the Tobit model of the off-farm labour income. The 
 panel data nature of the data used was not accounted 
 
 for in the guess of the double hurdle model and 
 the generalised Tobit model of off-farm work participation and off-farm labour income; these were guessed using MLE. 
 
 4. Results 
 Limit/guideline guesses of the profit function can be 
 found in Table 2. The guessed profit function (9) fits 
 the data well with an (changed to make better/changed to fit new conditions) R 2 of 0. 70. What's more, 
 the profit function is monotonically increasing with 
 respect to the fixed inputs (labour, capital, land and 
 technology), decreasing and curving out in the (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy)ised 
 price of changeable inputs. 
 First, a Tobit model (3) and Cragg model (4) were 
 guessed in order to test for fears to participate 
 in off-farm activities (Table 3). The Tobit model is 
 rejected significantll suggesting that farm families 
 are shy to do/complete their desired plan to participate in off-farm activities. The computation of the 
 dependent double hurdle model (8) was, however, 
 found to be heavy and difficult and full coming together was not

 possible to (accomplish or gain with effort) (Results of the dependent double 
 hurdle model are not given in this paper). Next, the 
 generalised Tobit model (7) was guessed. The relationship-related coefficient (p) is not very different 
 from zero pointing to/showing that it is not worthwhile to use the 
 limit/guideline guesses of the generalised Tobit model for 
 further analysis. Because of this, the results of the independent 
 double hurdle model have been used for further analysis and (understandings/ explanations). The results are summarised 
 in terms of almost-elasticities4 (Cramer, 1991, p. 8) for 
 the chance of participating in off-farm work and 
 elasticities for the off-farm labour income (Table 4). 
 Expected short-run farm (money made/good thing received) has a significant 
 bad effect on both the participation decision 
 and the level of off-farm labour income, but with 
 stronger hit/effect on the level of off-farm labour income 
 than on the want to participate. Non-labour income 
 did not show any significant effect on both the participation decision and off-farm labour income. An 
 increase in the output price by 1% increases expected 
 
 4 We use almost-ability to stretch for the participation decision since for a 
 chance response almost-ability to stretch is unit free. 
 
 short-run farm make money by 1.02% and the want to 
 participate in off-farm work decreases by 0.06%, 
 and decreases the off-farm labour income by 0.99% 
 on the average. So the 1992 and (list of things to deal with/desire to reach a goal) 2000 CAP 
 changes which decrease price support are most likely 
 to increase off-farm employment of farm families. 
 Family size, general education and age of the household head have a significant effect on the participation 
 decision, but an unimportant effect on the level of offfarm labour income. Family size increases the families' want to participate in off-farm work, which is 
 agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with the explanation. Families with a larger 
 family size have (compared to other things) higher not important utility of 
 income and a stronger want to participate in off-farm 
 work. General education of the household head has a 
 little but positive significant effect on the participation 
 decision (Huffman, 1980). Farming-based education 
 does not show any significant effect on the off-farm 
 work decision at all. Age and age squared of the 
 household head show a significant quadratic age pattern on the participation decision which is consistent 
 with the life-cycle guess (Sumner, 1982). On the 
 average, the desire of families to participate in offfarm work reaches its peak at the household head's age 
 
 170 
 
 T. Woldehanna et al./Agricultural Money flow 22 (2000) 163-171 
 
 of 41 years. This hints the number of dual 
 employment among young farmers and full time farming among older farmers (Benjamin and Guyomard, 
 1994). However, neither age nor age squared showed 
 any significant effect on the level of off-farm labour 
 income. 
 When the on-farm labour supply of the household 
 head increases, both the want to participate in offfarm work and the off-farm labour income decrease. 
 The direct effect of other family members' on-farm 
 labour supply is not very different from zero 
 in both the participation decision and the level of 
 off-farm labour income, but it has a little effect 
 indirectly through its effect on expected short-run 
 farm (money made/good thing received). 
 Farm (features/ qualities/ traits) such as land, capital and technology have a negative indirect hit/effect on both the offfarm work participation decision and the level of offfarm labour income. Whereas the direct effects of 
 capital and technology are positive for off-farm labour 
 income, they are not very different from zero 
 for the participation decision. As a result capital 
 and technology have a net negative effect on the 
 participation decision and a net positive effect on 
 the level of off-farm labour income. Land has a 
 significant positive direct effect and negative indirect 
 effect on the want to participate in off-farm work. 
 The direct effect rules the indirect effect and the 
 net effect turns out to be positive. But its direct effect 
 on the level of off-farm labour income is not significant and the net effect turns out to be negative. The 
 positive net effect of capital and technology on the 
 level of off-farm labour income may be due to the fact 
 that capital and technology employed by families 
 have a labour saving character. The net positive effect 
 of land on the off-farm work participation decision is a 
 strange result, which cannot be explained within the 
 (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) of a new-classical money-based explanation. 
 The personal price index (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy)ised by the price 
 of output shows a large and significant positive effect 
 on the level of off-farm labour income and a negative 
 but unimportant effect on the off-farm work participation decision. This illustrates that as the consumption 
 price increases the not important utility of fun decreases 
 and the strength of off-farm work increases. The 
 average market wage rate, which is invariant across 
 families, does not show any significant effect on the 
 off-farm work decision. 
 
 5. Ends/end results 
 The results confirm that farm families are shy by restricting and unexpected transaction costs 
 to participate in off-farm activities. Expected shortrun farm (money made/good thing received) and on-farm labour supplied by a 
 household head have a strong bad effect on 
 the off-farm work decision of a household. Whereas, 
 non-labour income, on-farm labour supplied by other 
 family members and farming-based education do not 
 show any significant hit/effect on the off-farm work 
 decision. Family size and general education show a 
 positive effect on the desire of families to participate in off-farm work, but not on the level of off-farm 
 labour income. Age of the household head shows 
 a significant quadratic pattern in the participation 
 decision only. 
 The policy hint/result/effect is that government payments 
 aimed at increasing household's income through price 
 policies may worsens/decreases the off-farm 
 employment of farm families. Whereas, direct 
 income support does not create a bad thing for 
 families to participate in off-farm work. Because of this, 
 the 1992 and (list of things to deal with/desire to reach a goal) 2000 CAP changes, decreased 
 price support in combination with direct income support, are most likely to increase off-farm employment 
 of plantable farm families in the Netherlands. However, in the presence of the (fear/stopping of behavior) to join off-farm 
 activities, the possible result of the CAP-reforms 
 cannot be fully (understood/made real/achieved). The results also suggest that 
 there is an different policy option for government 
 helping action if there is a need to make families 
 (branch out into different things) the ways in which they gain their job. 
 In the long run, the government can chase after policies such 
 as (helping increase/showing in a good way) education to enable farm families to 
 secure off-farm jobs more easily. In the short-run, 
 off-farm employment can be increased by reducing 
 fears, such as farm families' access to different 
 information sources, to join off-farm activities. 
 
 Responses 
 We are much owing Arie Oskam and Mars 
 Cramer for their helpful comments on an earlier draft. 
 We got good things from the discussion with Allison Burrell 
 on a double hurdle model. However, we remain 
 responsible for any remaining errors.
