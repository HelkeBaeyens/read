 Abstract 
 This paper presents a bio-money-based model of Andit Tid, a very much/very badly insulted/got worse crop-animals farming system with high 
 population density and good market access in the highlands of Ethiopia. Land worsening, population growth, spoiled 
 technology, and drought threaten food security in the area. Drought or weather risk appears to have increased over the last few years. 
 The bio-money-based model is used to analyse the combined effects of land worsening, population growth, market mistakes 
 and increased risk of drought on household production, welfare and food security. We find that the indirect effects of drought 
 on household welfare through the hit/effect on crop and animals prices are larger than the direct production effects of drought. 
 Provision and adoption of credit for fertiliser, although risky in itself, may lead to increased grain production and improved 
 household welfare and food security. Provision of credit may have a negative effect on (protection of natural things/using less energy, water, etc.) (rewards or reasons for doing something) but this effect 
 may be lessened by linking a (protection of natural things/using less energy, water, etc.) needed thing to the provision of credit for fertiliser.

 1. Introduction 
 Land worsening, poorness and food (state of not being safe/source of mental worry) are 
 widespread and interconnected problems in Ethiopia. 
 (random/including random data points) rainfall causes extreme droughts at irregular periods of time (or space) and these droughts threaten the lives and 
 jobs of millions of people. Policies and technologies that can add/give to increased food production and improved food security are badly needed.

 There is a growing interest in using bio-money-based 
 models as a tool for policy analysis in order to better 
 understand pathways of development2 and to test 
 the hit/effect of other choice policies on the valuable thing from nature base and human welfare. One of the potential 
 great benefits of these models is that they can provide 
 an improved and more complete indication of 
 the (reactions or responses to something/helpful returned information) effects between human activity and valuable things from nature. Modern computer power permits the

 of change (or spoiling) in farming and job plans, 
 connected with (proof that one thing definitely causes another) and conditioning factors (Pender et al., 
 1999).

 development of complex models far beyond what was 
 possible only a few years ago. It has therefore become 
 possible to make models that are possibly more 
 consistent and scientifically more correct. 
 The new experience of  the model presented here is that 
 it is a energetic non-separatable household model that 
 (at the same time) (combines different things together so they work as one unit) money-based optimisation in 
 production and consumption with inter-time-related (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) (instances of reactions, responses, or information about something), allowing for non-linearities 
 in restrictions as well as the unemotional function. Some 
 other bio-money-based models have not been truly energetic because they have incorporated future hits/effects 
 through (the ability to keep something around, or keep something going) restrictions or user costs only 
 (Holden, 1993a,b; Kruseman, 2000; Shiferaw and 
 Holden, 1999, 2000). This model is energetic, the 
 families (make as big as possible) discounted utility over a limited 
 time (line in the distance where the Earth and sky meet). 
 Market mistakes and mixed-up nature of useful things/valuable supplies across families in the study area cause 
 land use at the plot level to depend on household 
 useful things/valuable supplies (Holden et al., 2001). Models are therefore 
 developed for different household categories. The 
 models are adjusted and grouped to look like the 
 actual pattern of household interactions through their 
 participation in (not totally pure/not totally correct) factor and output markets. 
 These market mistakes include limited access 
 to off-farm employment, price bands for outputs and 
 labour, a held back rental market for land through 
 share (living somewhere), oxen rental market through exchange 
 with labour only, held back access to formal credit 
 in kind (for fertiliser) or to informal credit at a high 
 interest rate. 
 This version of the model also includes risk 
 disliking behaviour through a constant partial relative 
 risk disgust utility function, production risk due to 
 drought, and bad thing risk hatred of taking credit 
 for fertiliser. Drought also affects prices for crops and 
 animals and price expectations and these have added/more effects on household production and welfare. 
 Earlier optimisation models were also criticised for 
 being linear while the reality they were supposed to 
 represent was highly non-linear. While piece-wise linear representations of non-linear relationships may 
 serve as good and (producing a lot with very little waste) guesses, recent advances that allow for large non-linear optimisation 
 models increase believability. 
 Like the Ginchi model (Okumu et al., 1999, 2000), 
 this model endogenises the effects of land worsening 
 
 in the form of soil wearing away and nutrient (everything is gone). The 
 availability of biophysical data from (protecting something from harm) experiments in the study area allows us to guess wearing away rates as well as crop working well responses on 
 different soils in the study area. The model furthermore (combines different things together so they work as one unit) crop and animals interactions. Crop 
 choice, building or removal of (protecting something from harm) structures 
 on different types of land as well as fertiliser and poop/fertilizer use are endogenous decisions that affect the rate 
 ofland worsening. These decisions affect wearing away and 
 nutrient (everything is gone) rates that decide/figure out crop working well in later years. 
 Farming-based production happens in two cropping seasons per year, the meher and belg seasons. 
 (not very long ago), the belg season rains have failed in a few 
 years in a row, which was rare in the past. The goal of this article is to analyse the effects/results/suggestions of 
 this new increased production risk using the energetic 
 bio-money-based model. Specifically, we test: 
 (a) how risk of drought in combination with land 
 worsening and population growth affects household production, income, welfare and food security; and 
 (b) the hit/effect of credit for fertiliser on household 
 welfare, food security, (rewards or reasons for doing something) to (protect from harm) land 
 and soil wearing away. 
 In Section 2 of the paper, we give a brief description of the case study area. The basic structure of the 
 bio-money-based model is organized and listed in Section 3, followed 
 by a discussion of the way(s) of doing things of bio-money-based 
 modelling in Section 4. The results and discussion are 
 presented in Section 5, followed by the end/end result. 
 
 2. Description of the case study area and data 
 Andit Tid is located about 60 km north of 
 Debre Berhan, along the main road between Addis 
 Ababa and the Tigray Area, in North Showa in the 
 Central Ethiopian Highlands. This hints that the 
 market access is fairly good. The area is classified as 
 belonging to the low potential cereal-animals zone 
 and is very much/very badly insulted/got worse. It is a high height area 
 (&amp;gt;3000 m.a.s.l.). The land is located in two height 
 zones; dega zone ( &amp;lt;3200 m.a.s.l.) and wurch zone 
 (&amp;gt;3200m.a.s.l.). The average rainfall is 1336mm per 
 year distributed over two growing seasons, the meher

 season from June to November and the belg season 
 from January to May. Droughts have not been common in the area until very lately, when the belg rains 
 have failed in two years in a row (1999 and 2000). 
 Hailstorms and frost have, however, commonly damaged crops. 
 The two most in control/most common soil types are andosols and 
 regosols. Andosols rule in the wurch zone w&#126;ile 
 regosols rule in the dega zone. Andosols are nch 
 in organic matter due to the high elevation. The grass 
 turf is collected in heaps and burnt3 before planting 
 of grain. This releases (vitamins, minerals, protein, etc.) for the crop but also 
 causes (large/relatively large) losses of organic matter and soil 
 nitrogen. Yohannes (1989) guessed 75% of the land 
 to be on steep slopes (&amp;gt;25% slope). Soil wearing away rates 
 in the area are very high and a large share of the land is 
 shallow, causing reduction of soil depth to affect crop 
 rooting depth and so yields (Shiferaw and Holden, 
 2001). Holden and Shiferaw (2000) guessed 21% 
 of the farming-based land to be shallow ( &amp;lt;30 em soil 
 depth) and 48% to be of medium depth (30-60 em) 
 (Table 1). Based on the survey data, we divided land 
 into eight land classes for our modelling (Table 2). 
 Different forms of (using less of something) technologies are 
 common in the area. They have partly been introduced 
 through external food-for-work programs. (coming from the outside of something)ly introduced (using less of something) structures have later 
 been partly removed by the farmers. Shiferaw and 
 Holden (1998) found that people pressure 
 (land (not enough of something)) increased the chance that (using less of something) structures were partly or fully removed. The

 reasons for this were thought to be that the (protecting something from harm) structures did not add/give to increased yields 
 in the short run, the structures occupied some land 
 and therefore reduced the effective planting area, and 
 the structures collected life-giving soils that could be used 
 to increase short run production by taking apart the 
 structures and spreading out the soil collected there. 
 The structures could also harbour rats that might 
 damage crops. 
 The main crop in the area is grain, followed by 
 wheat, horse bean and field pea. Lentils and linseeds 
 are also commonly grown. Most crop production takes 
 place in the dega zone but grain is also grown in 
 the wurch zone in the belg season. The high elevation 
 prevents production of other crops in this zone. . 
 (cows, bulls, etc.)  and sheep are the most in control/most common types of animals, but goats, (horse-related)s and chicken are also common (Table 2). The animal population density is very 
 high in the area; Yohannes (1989) guessed it to be 
 1.48 (related to areas near the Equator/hot and humid) animals units per hectare (TLU/ha) 
 against 0.36 as the average for the Ethiopian highlands 
 (Table 3). We found this density to have increased to 
 2.03 TLU/ha in 1998 but it (lowered in number/got worse/gotten worse) to 1.71 TLU/ha 
 by the end of 1999 due to the drought (Holden and 
 Shiferaw, 2000). 
 The people density was guessed to be 
 145.5 people/km2 in 1986 against the average of 61 
 people/km2 for the Ethiopian highlands (Yohannes, 
 1989). The population density was 230 people!km 2 
 cultivable land. The population growth rate was guessed to be 3% per year, pointing to/showing that population 
 pressure in the area is increasing. 
 Production of crops and animals are well integrated 
 in the area. Oxen are the most in control/most common source of traction 
 power. Hand (producing crops/helping something grow) is used only on very steep 
 slopes (unable to be used or understood) by oxen. Animal poop/fertilizer is used 
 for fuel or as fertiliser on crops. Sale of animals is an 
 important source of cash income. Crop residues are 
 used as animal food. Food is otherwise received/got 
 from unplanted land and grazing land but only a small 
 share of this (5%) is from shared land. There is, 
 however, free grazing outside the cropping season and 
 this may create (rewards or reasons for doing something) for overstocking of animals. 
 Food shortage is an important restriction and (instance of buying something for money) of food and the use of cut and carry system 
 are the main plans to overcome this problem besides limiting the number of animals kept (Holden and 
 Shiferaw, 2000).

 The land useful things/valuable supplies (land of different qualities) are 
 fairly evenly distributed among families in the area 
 due to the land reform and frequent land redistributions within which/by which land was set apart and given out to families based 
 on household size. Animals wealth is therefore a better indicator of household wealth and wealth (using different things). Especially oxen ownership shows/indicates the farming ability (to hold or do something) of families as the rental market for

 oxen (ploughing) is (not totally pure/not totally correct) (Holden and Shiferaw, 
 2000). It also leads to the typical pattern where families without oxen rent out land to families with 
 two oxen or more, while families with one ox exchange oxen among themselves. 
 Land renting usually takes the form of share (living somewhere), where the share to the owner differs/changes between 0.5 
 and 0.25 depending on land quality. Families may 
 have access to credit in kind for (instance of buying something for money) of fertilisers 
 but are unwilling to take this credit even though it appears money-making. Production and market risk and high 
 hatred of these types of risk cause families to be 
 unwilling to buy fertiliser on credit. 
 Families have limited access to off-farm income 
 sources and crop production is highly survival/income oriented, but the (popular thing/general way things are going) during the last 20 years has been 
 from families being net sellers of food grains to 
 now being net buyers. The recent droughts have even 
 changed the area to become dependent on food aid 
 (Holden and Shiferaw, 2000).

 Plot level data were collected by visiting and measuring (by triangulation) and watching/ noticing/ celebrating/ obeying all plots and 
 by interviewing the families owning or renting 
 the plots. Table 1 summarises the plot level data by 
 soil/climatic zone and soil depth. 
 Wearing away rates were guessed based on experiments 
 carried out by SCRP4 over many years in the study 
 site. Yield responses were guessed based on SCRP 
 experimental data for (protecting something from harm) technology responses, and based on FAO fertiliser experiments 
 and local crop-fertiliser (act of showing or proving) plots managed 
 by the extension system. A complete analysis 
 of some of these data is presented in Shiferaw and 
 Holden (2001). 
 Socio-money-based data were collected in household 
 surveys in 1986, 1994, 1998 and 2000. The three 
 last surveys were carried out by the authors. These 
 data were used to structure and adjust the bio-money-based models for the different household categories 
 (Tables 1-3). Prices from 1997 ((usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) year) and 1999 
 (drought year) (Table 4) were used to construct expected prices based on the chance of drought. 
 
 3. The bio-money-based model 
 Earlier versions of this model include Shiferaw et al. 
 (2000, 2001). The main (act of something getting bigger, wider, etc.) of the model pre4 Soil Conservation Research Project (SCRP) was given money by 
 the Swiss government and carried out soil (protecting something from harm) research 
 in selected places/locations in the Ethiopian highlands from 1981 to the 
 mid-1990s.

 sented here is the introduction of risk due to (random/including random data points) rainfall, a better representation of the market mistakes found in the area, a better adjustment of 
 the model to the actual conditions in the area based 
 on new survey data (Holden and Shiferaw, 2000), and 
 many minor changes/recalculations improving the possible (state of always working or appearing the same way) of the model and its truth/trueness in terms 
 of its ability to copy current and recent land use 
 and household welfare in the study area. 
 A simple idea-based representation of the model is 
 presented in Fig. 1. A more described/explained technical description is given in Add on A. Families (make as big as possible) 
 their welfare (measured as utility of sure feeling equal full income) subject to many restrictions. The 
 model is energetic and non-linear. For example, land 
 worsening in form of soil wearing away and nutrient (everything is gone) is endogenous as it is affected by household production and investment decisions. What's more, soil 
 wearing away affects soil depth which in turn affects yields 
 and output in following years that again affect income and welfare. Weather risk affects production 
 as well as prices and this may again affect production decisions. Families make production decisions

 based on expectations about prices and output and 
 the risk involved. Mistakes in markets (limited 
 access, high transaction costs) affect production decisions and cause non-separability of production and 
 consumption decisions. Population growth affects both 
 the labour force and household welfare as more people have to share the result of a constant land area 
 that also is affected by land worsening. This leads 
 to a Malthusian development path when technology, 
 prices and other (coming from the outside of something) factors are constant. This 
 poorness-(surrounding conditions) trap can only be broken through 
 availability of new technologies, improved access to 
 markets and better investment opportunities. 
 
 4. Way(s) of doing things 
 Holden et al. (200 1) found that market mistakes in the study area affected land use and plot level 
 land working well and this has effects/results/suggestions for how 
 units for bio-money-based modelling were identified. 
 These findings point to/show that group bio-money-based 
 models at (very important) and/or community levels would 
 do not face/deal with issues related to social (using different things) 
 and its hit/effect on land use. Watershed or community 
 level bio-money-based models usually depend on perfect 
 market ideas (you think are true) and separability of production 
 
 decisions from consumption decisions or on equality-believing distribution of useful things/valuable supplies and equal market access 
 within communities. 5 These ideas (you think are true) do not fit 
 well with scientific reality in the Ethiopian highlands 
 in general and the case study area especially. It 
 appears more appropriate to model land use decisions 
 at the household group level, and to group together from 
 (uniform) household groups to the community or (related to an area of land that drains into a river) levels later/after that. However, our approach does 
 not (take control of) clear (related to space or existing in space) issues such as the close 
 neighbour effects of (protection of natural things/using less energy, water, etc.) decisions ((related to space or existing in space) 
 ex ternali ties). 
 Household group modelling and grouping needs/demands proper weighting and adjustment of the different models to make happy local demand and supply 
 equations. It is assumed that population growth takes 
 place by growth of average household size for the different household groups. The share of families in 
 the different household groups may change over time, 
 however, and this must be (changed to make better/changed to fit new conditions) during grouping in later years. Or, farm sizes could be 
 (changed to make better/changed to fit new conditions) down if breaking (up) of land holdings or 
 
 5 The land reform in Ethiopia resulted in an equality-believing land 
 distribution in most communities. However, distribution of household labour and animals, especially oxen used for traction, is less 
 equally distributed.

 Belg season- 
 Cereals 
 (peas, beans, lentils, etc.) 
 
 Source: Own data. 
 a 1999 was a year with drought in the belg season, therefore no crops were planted in this season. This may have cause the move/change in 
 cereal-related production to the meher season. 
 
 land redistributions happens. 6 We have adjusted 
 the model to fit the actual land sizes after the latest 
 land redistribution in 1997 in the study area. Farm 
 sizes are based on actually measured plots. Measured 
 farm sizes turned out to be on average 30% larger 
 than reported by farmers. 
 Total action and open access useful things/valuable supplies or common property governments may possibly be important in 
 relation to the focus of our study. In our study area, 
 most of the land has been divided and distributed to 
 individual families. Only a small share of the food useful things/valuable supplies come from shared and open access 
 land. There is also very little total action in the 
 area. We therefore think that the errors we commit by 
 treating these supplies as (coming from the outside of something) in the model are 
 small. 
 The model is validated by comparison of base runs 
 with actual survey data for key output (numbers that change/things that change) for the 
 different household groups (Table 5).7 The model is 
 built in GAMS. A 5-year model contains about 
 39,600 (numbers that change/things that change) and 23,300 equations, many of which 
 are non-linear. 
 
 6 As our model only has a time (line in the distance where the Earth and sky meet)  of 5 years these problems 
 are not thought about/believed important for our analysis. 
 7 Eucalyptus was not included in the 5-year model presented in 
 this paper. We have run other models, for longer time periods, that 
 include eucalyptus, but have not included these in this paper due 
 to size restrictions. There were no meaningful changes in cropping 
 pattern over the 5-year period and we have therefore not included 
 information on these changes. 
 
 5. Results and discussion 
 5.1. Land worsening, crop working well and 
 hit/effect of (using less of something) technologies 
 Fig. 2 shows the yield (popular things/general ways things are going) over 5 years of grain on regosols on the four different land classes with 
 and without (using less of something) technologies when no fertiliser or poop/fertilizer is applied. Produces /gives up are shown for the 
 cases when (using less of something) structures do not reduce initial produces and when initial produces /gives up are affected negatively. We see that produces /gives up are lowest and decline most 
 quickly on shallow and steep soils. 
 In Fig. 3, the decline in yields of grain over a 
 5-year period on regosols in the meher season and on 
 andosols in the belg season, with and without (using less of something) technologies and without and with a fairly 
 high level of fertiliser application, are shown. We see 
 that yields decline (a) little faster on andosols than on 
 regosols, faster on un-conserved than on conserved 
 land, faster on shallow soils and steep slopes, and 
 faster when no fertiliser is used. Yields decline even 
 on deeper soils that are (protected from harm) and receive a high 
 level of fertiliser (55 kg Nand 50 kg P205 per ha) because (protecting something from harm) does not eliminate soil wearing away and 
 a not important reduction in rooting depth reduces yields.

 technologies reduce the yields due to their occupation of a part of the area. 
 
 on farm labour and credit demand are presented in 
 Table 6 for the two oxen household group. The effect of providing credit for fertiliser ((free to move around/without rules or restrictions)) 
 is compared to the case when credit access is held back. The models have been run for 10 and 20% 
 risk of drought. We see that families with access 
 to credit a little bit make up for the increasing 
 risk of drought by reallocating their production such 
 that crop sales are lower in good years (no drought) 
 to reduce the need to buy crops (food) in case of 
 drought. Without access to credit families are less 
 able to do this and even become net buyers of crops 
 in good years after a few years due to land worsening and population growth. Provision of credit 
 and fertiliser supply may therefore a little bit 
 reduce the need for food aid in drought years. Credit 
 and fertiliser use helps also to better sustain household welfare while the development path is clearly 
 Malthusian without access to credit for fertiliser 
 (Table 6). 
 
 There are both direct and indirect effects of drought. 
 First, there is a direct production effect as crop production is reduced due to drought. The belg season 
 drought has been so extreme that no crops could be 
 produced in this season. This production loss is therefore equal to the total belg season crop production in 
 good years. The fact that the drought strikes over a 
 larger (related to where mountains, rivers, cities, etc., are located) area leads to indirect price effects. 
 Obviously, crop prices will increase in drought years 
 and families are usually net buyers of crops in 
 such years. This hints that they have to buy crops 
 at a higher price. Also, animals prices decline 
 when the drought is extreme as people are forced to sell 
 animals to buy food. This leads to a animals value 
 loss. We incorporated these losses in the model with 
 and without access to credit and with a 10% risk of 
 drought. The results are presented in Table 7. We see 
 that the production loss is higher with access to credit 
 because fertiliser is used on grain in the belg season 
 in good years (no drought). The production loss tends

 to (lower in number/get worse) over years due mainly to crop working well loss. The loss due to the need to buy cereals for 
 food in drought years increases over time, however, 
 and is not much different with or without access to 
 credit for fertiliser. Animals value losses decline over 
 time as the number of animals declines over time. The 
 total loss is around 80% of the poorness line income 
 when credit access is held back and even higher 
 when credit for fertiliser is used. The direct production loss is 30--40% of the total loss without access to 
 credit and is 40-50% of the total loss with access to 
 credit. 
 
 5.3. Hit/effect of credit on (protection of natural things/using less energy, water, etc.) (rewards or reasons for doing something) 
 The model includes both the options of removal 
 of (protection of natural things/using less energy, water, etc.) structures and of building new (protection of natural things/using less energy, water, etc.) structures and there is a labour needed thing 
 for maintaining (using less of something) structures. Earlier versions of our model were used to test how credit access 
 and fertiliser use affected (rewards or reasons for doing something) to (use less) land 
 (Shiferaw et al., 2001). In Table 8, we present new results on this for the case in which (using less of something) technologies do not reduce initial yields. The table shows 
 that the total wearing away (tons of soil per farm) is higher

 after provision of credit as the area (protected something natural/use less fuel, water, etc.) is lower, 
 especially in the first years. The proportion of total 
 land (protected something natural/use less fuel, water, etc.) increases from 39 to 64% when there 
 is no access to credit and from 29 to 62% with access to credit. There is some removal of conservation 
 structures in the terminal year. 
 In Table 9, we look at the case in which (protecting something from harm) structures reduce initial yields. Here we look 
 at the hit/effect of credit as well as the hit/effect of linking access to credit to a (protecting something from harm) needed thing for 
 land where fertiliser is used. We see that wearing away rates 
 are higher when initial produces /gives up are reduced by (protecting something from harm) structures. More labour is used for removal of 
 conservation structures in the first year. Provision of 
 credit does not increase wearing away as much in the case 
 in which (protecting something from harm) structures reduce initial yields, 
 because (protecting something from harm) structures are also removed in 
 the credit held back case. (impressive/forcing (on people)/causing an inconvenient situation) an interlinkage 
 (cross-obedience) policy that credit for fertiliser only 
 is available for (protected from harm) land, reduces wearing away levels 
 by 5-15%. The reduction is largest in the first years 
 as less (protecting something from harm) structures are removed and more 
 new structures are built. Household welfare is reduced 
 a little bit by the interlinkage policy and total 
 labour needed thing is increased in the first years. 
 Household welfare improves much compared 
 to the credit held back case, however. 
 An important policy question is how easy or hard  it is to put into use this type of interlinkage policy. 
 There are extension agents in Andit Tid and they are 
 already involved in (helping increase/showing in a good way) fertiliser use through 
 organising (act of showing or proving) plots in farmers' fields. It is 
 therefore (compared to other things) easy for them to give such 
 a cross-obedience needed thing. The extension agent 
 in the area told us that he only gave fertiliser credit 
 for use on flat and good soils. Few families dared 
 to take credit for fertiliser, however, due to the risk 
 involved. This special credit risk disgust appeared to 
 be due to bad experience in the past when the punishment for failing to pay back credit was very bad/extreme. 
 
 in the belg season. We have developed a model to 
 test the hits/effects of the drought on household production and welfare. We use the model to test both 
 the direct production losses and the indirect losses due 
 to price changes for crops and animals. Families 
 will need to buy cereals at a high price in drought 
 years to meet their food needs and/or they depend 
 on food aid. Land worsening and population growth 
 increase the need to buy food over time, and the 
 area has changed from being a extra producer to 
 a net buyer of cereals. What's more, extreme drought 
 causes animals prices to (lower in number/get worse). As animals is the 
 most important form of wealth that families have, 
 this indirect effect of drought is (large/relatively large). Different forms of storage of wealth, e.g. bank savings, 
 should be (helped increase/showed in a good way). 
 We find that provision of credit for fertiliser may increase cereal-related production much and make more 
 families extra producers of grains, at least in 
 years when drought does not happen. As much of the 
 grain is produced in the belg season, provision of 
 credit for fertiliser does not reduce much the need to 
 buy cereals in drought years. Higher production 
 in good years may, however, make families more 
 able to deal with drought year losses. The decline in 
 household welfare over time may also be reduced by 
 provision of credit for fertiliser. 
 Provision of credit for fertiliser has a negative effect 
 on (rewards or reasons for doing something) to (protect something natural/use less fuel, water, etc.) land and this causes wearing away 
 rates to be higher when credit is given. In the case 
 when (protecting something from harm) structures reduce initial yields it 
 may be useful to interlink provision of credit for fertiliser to a (protecting something from harm) needed thing as this may create added/more (rewards or reasons for doing something) to (protect from harm) land and reduce 
 wearing away rates. 
 Overall, even the combination of (protecting something from harm) structures and high levels of fertiliser use cannot sustain 
 crop produces /gives up as wearing away cannot be eliminated and soils 
 in the area are shallow. Technical change, population 
 control, better access to off-farm employment and out 
 traveling are necessary to avoid starvation or long-lasting 
 dependence on food aid in the future. 
 
 6. Ends/end results 
 We have developed a bio-money-based model for a 
 very much/very badly poor-quality area with high population density 
 and good market access in the Ethiopian highlands. 
 The area has (not very long ago) been exposed to extreme droughts

 Highlands". ILRI and IFPRI have given money and 
 organizational support for the work. The Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has given money for this 
 research in the Arnhara Area in Ethiopia. We also 
 draw on earlier work given money by the Research Group of people of Norway. We admit/recognize/respond to valuable input from 
 Jens Aune to an earlier version of the model. Valuable 
 comments on earlier versions of the paper have been 
 received from an unnamed reviewer and from Peter 
 Hazell, John Pender and people (who were part of a study, etc.) in (school) courses at 
 ILRI in Addis Ababa and IFPRI in Washington, DC.

 The basic possible structure of the model follows. 
 The household model represents an average household 
 in a household group. We leave out household group subscripts in the explaining/big show below to simply note. 
 Representative families (for household groups) 
 are assumed to (make as big as possible) welfare: 
 T 
 
 where E(y1 ) is the expected full income 10 in Ethiopian 
 Birr in period t. Survival/income fun, Lemin, is valued 
 at the highest wage rate, wy,, needed/demanded for the work 
 force of the household, taking out only the survival/income 
 level of fun, to create an income exactly equal 
 to the poorness line income:

 U =

 dt = 
 
 L:/u

 (A.1)

 through a time-separatable utility function over the time 
 (line in the distance where the Earth and sky meet)  T. Utility in period t is discounted by the discount factor,/ = (1/(1 + 8)) 1 , where 8 is the utility 
 discount rate. 
 Utility in period it is  represented by a constant partial 
 relative risk disgust utility function; 8 
 Ut 
 
 = (1 - J.L)f 1-JL 
 
 + J.L- 1 
 
 (A.2) 
 
 where J.L is the partial relative risk disgust or the 
 (value of a number, ignoring its sign) of the ability to stretch of not important utility of 
 sure feeling equal full income, Y, which is equal to: 
 (A.3) 
 
 where E(/1) is expected (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy)ised full income in period t, 1/rlt the bad thing risk higher cost related to getting formal credit and o/21 the risk higher cost related 
 to drought risk in the belg season. Full income was 
 (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy)ised by the poorness line full income (y 1), while 
 8 This type of utility function has been used by Binswanger 
 (1981) and others in scientific studies of risk preferences of farm 
 families. Its simple form makes it attractive also for modelling 
 purposes as risk disgust is (taken by force/controlled) by a single limit/guideline. 
 
 (A.5) 
 
 where Lmax is the maximum time available for work 
 and 1;1 is the poorness line income leaving out/keeping out the value 
 of fun. The time gift, F 1 , of the household 
 may then be created as follows: 
 Ft = 
 
 Lemin 
 
 + Lmax 
 
 (A.6) 
 
 and poorness line full income is: 
 Yt = Wy,Ft 
 
 T 
 
 (A.4) 
 
 Yt 
 
 Wy = - 1 
 Lmax 
 
 Add on A. Described/explained model description 
 
 43 
 
 (A.7) 
 
 This creation gives utility equal to zero if the 
 household has Y1 = 1, negative utility if Y1 is below the poorness line (Y1 &amp;lt; 1), and positive utility if 
 Y1 &amp;gt; 1. Population growth affects the time gift and poorness line income causing both to grow 
 (fair in amount, related to something else/properly sized compared to something else)ly over time. 
 We are interested in the welfare changes of families over time. We define a Boserupian development path (Boserup, 1965) as a path where utility, 
 u1 , grows over time, and a Malthusian development 
 path (Malthus, 1798) as a path where utility declines 
 over time. 11 The needed thing for a Boserupian development path is then that income grows faster than the 
 population, as Y1 is a measure of per person income in 
 period t. 
 Risk premia are adjusted (Eqs. (A.8) and (A.9)) 
 using a Taylor (act of something getting bigger, wider, etc.) and guess over the 
 utility function (Sadoulet and de Janvry, 1995): 
 9 Based on Dercon and Krishnan (1996) who develop 
 consumption-based poorness lines for (away from cities) Ethiopia, including the 
 study area. The poorness line is therefore treated as (coming from the outside of something) in 
 the model. 
 1 Figured out/calculated based on chances of drought, hailstorm/frost 
 damage and expected prices. 
 11 The (popular thing/general way things are going) must be tested over a period of a few years as 
 it might otherwise be hid/hidden by (for only a short time) disturbances.

 where f.Ld is the added/more risk disgust related to 
 credit risk, C1 the amount of credit taken in period t, 
 i is the interest rate, and var(l1) is the variance of income. Variance of income is figured out/calculated on the basis 
 of results in good and bad years (drought years) 
 and the chance of drought. This hints that variance of income also depends on crop choice and land 
 worsening/conservation decisions. 
 
 A.l. Market (features/ qualities/ traits) 
 
 Families may sell labour in some seasons 
 and buy labour in other seasons, however. The 
 families are assumed to be boring work disliking 
 (Chayanov, 1966; Nakajima, 1986). This hints 
 that the shadow wage rate is an increasing function 
 of the time worked and that there is a trade-off 
 between income and fun. (not caring) curves 
 between income and fun will be upward sloping 
 and curving out in labour and income space. Household 
 preferences for fun in income-labour space are 
 created as a reservation wage curve that is curving out and upward sloping and adjusted to fit the 
 watched/followed seasonal labour supply/leisure demand 
 and wage rates in the area: 
 
 w; = fh + f]zDp + f33(Dp- f34) 2, 
 L* 
 Dp = ; , 
 
 L; :'S Lp, 
 
 L; = LpF- LpH 
 
 The model includes the following market (features/ qualities/ traits). We leave out the subscript for year to simplify note. 
 
 - Credit market: Formal credit in kind (for fertiliser) 
 that is held back from above (Eq. (A.lO)): 
 (A.lO) 
 This credit must be repaid after harvest. It may also 
 be possible to get informal credit within the village at a higher rate of interest (Eq. (All)): 
 (A.ll) 
 This credit must also be paid back within the same 
 year. 
 - Labour market: Families are assumed to have 
 held back access to off-farm employment and the 
 wage rate in the labour market differs/changes across seasons. 
 Families may also hire labour for work on the 
 farm. A price band is introduced such that the wage 
 rate for hiring labour, is about 10-20% higher than 
 the wage rate received/got while working off-farm. The 
 household shadow wage in season p, 
 should 
 fall between the buying wage and the selling wage 
 when families do not participate in the labour 
 market (Eq. (A.12)).

 (A.12) 
 
 LpF = Lpc 
 
 + Lpo, 
 
 + LpL, 
 
 LpT = L; 
 
 + LpE 
 (A.13) 
 
 where f3s are limits/guidelines, D P is the seasonal family labour divided by the household labour force 
 (W), L P is the maximum time which is available 
 for work, 12 Lpc is seasonal family labour in crop 
 production, L pL is seasonal family labour in animals production, Lpo is seasonal off-farm family labour, L; is total seasonal family labour, LpF 
 is total seasonal on farm labour and LpH is hired 
 labour, LpT is the total seasonal time gift, 
 and LpE is the seasonal fun time. Labour for 
 conservation (building of new structures, maintenance of structures, and removal of old structures) 
 is included in LpcÂ· The religious holiday restriction 
 may be binding and limit labour supply in some periods of the year. The shadow wage is serious and stubborn 
 by the intersection of the wage equation with the 
 labour restriction. We have not included a (male/female status) 
 division of labour in the model because of the (problems, delays, etc.) it would involve. This may suggest that labour 
 portion is (producing more with less waste) in the model than in 
 reality. 
 12 Maximum time available for farm work is figured out by/decided by subtracting religious holidays from the total number of days in the 
 period. Work on the fatm is not permitted on religious holidays.

 - Land market: There is an informal rental market for 
 land in the area. This market is (connected, like chain links) with the 
 output market as the rent is paid in the form of a 
 share of the output (share (living somewhere)). It is usually 
 families without oxen that are forced to rent out 
 part of their land and this land is rented in by families with two or more oxen. The share of the output 
 paid to the owner differs/changes from 0.5 on the best land to 
 0.25 on poorer land. The lack of land in the area 
 in combination with the stickiness of the 'price' in 
 form of share of the output, cause demand (represented 
 by superscript d) for land to go beyond supply (Holden 
 and Shiferaw, 2000). Actual rented land cannot go beyond the supply, however. A good reputation is important in order to be able to rent in land. For families renting land, represented by superscript 2, we 
 get: 
 2d 
 Aos Aqr 
 &amp;gt; Y qr 1otq, 
 
 (A.l4) 
 where A&#126; 0 is a vector of operated land holding 
 (subscript o) by land type (subscript q), Aqw is a 
 vector of owned land (subscript w) by land quality class, A&#126;r is rented land which is supply held back given the shares of the output, C:tq, that 
 have to be paid to the owner. Usually, these shares 
 are equal to 0.5 for the best quality land, 0.33 on 
 medium quality land and 0.25 on poor quality land. 
 With these shares there 'Y is excess demand. is the 
 relative population weight for families renting 
 out against/compared to/or families renting in land. For families renting out land, represented by superscript 0, we 
 have: 
 A oqo 
 
 = 
 
 A-o 
 
 qw - 
 
 Aos 1 - 
 
 qr otq 
 
 (A.l5) 
 
 - Oxen rental market: Families that rent out land 
 do so because they don't have oxen and are unable to borrow or rent in oxen to help grow the land themselves. 
 Oxen owners are unwilling to rent out their oxen 
 due to moral danger/risk problems and the risk of their 
 oxen being mismanaged. Oxen may be borrowed 
 or rented, Oxrp- from relatives or close neighbours, 
 usually in exchange for labour ((connected, like chain links) markets). Seasonal oxen working days, Ox 0 p, is therefore the sum of the working days by owned oxen 
 
 45 
 
 (Oxwp) and the amount of oxen days rented in or 
 out (Oxrp) during the period. Available oxen labour 
 days from own oxen is limited by the number of 
 religious holidays in the month. 
 
 = Oxwp Â± Oxrp, 
 WJoLiop = Oxrp :=:;: Oxrp, 
 
 OXop 
 
 (A.l6) 
 
 Oxwp:::;: Oxwp 
 
 The cost of keeping oxen relates to their buying 
 or breeding cost, food demand and the labour cost 
 of looking after them. 
 - Food market: Food is supplied by crop stover, 
 grass production on grazing and unplanted land, and 
 (bought something for money) food. Families may decide to buy 
 or sell food depending on their farm size, land 
 portion choices, the size of their animals and 
 the price and availability of food. The supply of 
 food (Fo) in dry matter through own production 
 and (instance of buying something for money) (Fod) is: 
 Fo = K8yicrAq Acr 
 
 + KFod, 
 
 Fod:::;: Fo 
 
 (A.l7) 
 
 where 8yicrAq is a vector of stover or food yields 
 for different crops, including grass and unplanted land, 
 for different land types, and K is a vector of dry 
 matter (changing from one form, state, or state of mind to another) factors. 
 - Seed market: It is assumed that markets for seed 
 function well but a price band is included making 
 the price of (bought) seeds 5% higher than the 
 selling price. Families also have the option of 
 storing seeds from their own harvest for the next 
 season. 
 - Output markets: Output markets are assumed to 
 function well but a price band is included such that 
 the purchase price is assumed to be 5% higher than 
 the selling price. 
 A.2. Land worsening and conservation 
 The main forms of land worsening in the model 
 are soil wearing away and nutrient (everything is gone). Plot level soil 
 wearing away per unit ofland (se Aq) is a function of soil type, 
 soil depth and slope (land type class, Aq), rainfall (1/Jr ), 
 crop choice (Cr), and use of (protecting something from harm) technology 
 (l/1):

 crop choice/land use or by bu<p><strong>NOTE: This document is incomplete. It was shortened to the maximum document length of 50,000 characters.</strong></p><div style="clear:both">&nbsp;</div>
