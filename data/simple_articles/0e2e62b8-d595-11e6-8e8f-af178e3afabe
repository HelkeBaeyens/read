 Professional's Abstract 
 Recent statements (that someone has done something bad) against money-makers in general and long-only valuable thing index money in 
 particular, include: increasing market dangerous nature/wild up and down prices, twisting/lying about historical price relationships, and 
 fueling a fast increase and decrease in valuable thing inflation. Some (people who work to find information) have argued that 
 these market people (who were part of a study, etc.)--through their hit/effect on market prices--may accidentally prevented the 
 (producing a lot with very little waste) distribution of food aid to deserving groups. Certainly, this result--if proved-- 
 would counter the classical argument that money-makers make prices (producing more with less waste) and so improve 
 the money-based (wasting very little while working or producing something) of the farming-based and food marketing system. Given the very important 
 policy effects/results/suggestions, it is important to develop a more thorough understanding of long-only index money 
 and their potential market hit/effect. Here, we review the criticisms (and arguments) charged and collected against 
 (and for) valuable thing index money in recent U.S. Government-related statements (in court). Then, added/more 
 evidence is added (related to/looking at/thinking about) thin sliceal market returns and the relative levels of 
 long-only index fund participation in 12 valuable thing futures markets. The results suggest that index 
 fund positions across futures markets have no hit/effect on relative price changes across those 
 markets. The scientific results provide no (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) that long-only index money impact valuable thing 
 futures prices. 
 Key Words: Commitment's of Traders, index money, valuable thing futures markets 
 
 Introduction 
 The fast increase in valuable thing futures prices from 2005 through 2008--coupled with greater 
 overall trade volumes and larger positions held by long-only valuable thing index money--have fueled 
 a debate as to whether a price "bubble" existed in these markets. The debate has found its way to 
 the halls of the U.S. Congress, where law-makers are thinking about measures to control "too much/too many" 
 guess/guessing (e.g., Lieberman 2008). The "pro-bubble" side is mostly supported by certain hedge 
 fund managers, some policy-makers, and valuable thing end-users (e.g., Gheit 2008; Masters 2008; 
 Masters and White 2008). On the other side, some school-related money-flow experts are doubting the 
 bubble explanation, referring to a lack of evidence (e.g., Krugman 2008; Pirrong 2008; Sanders and 
 Irwin 2008). As an other choice, the "anti-bubble" (related to one thing depending on another thing that might or might not happen) hints that prices are driven by 
 basic factors that have pushed valuable things to higher--and maybe permanently higher-- 
 price levels (see Irwin and Good 2009). 
 The result of the bubble debate has immediate money-based results for the U.S. valuable thing 
 futures industry, trading amounts/quantities, and possibly the pricing (wasting very little while working or producing something) of valuable thing futures 
 markets. In the bigger picture, the debate has possibly large results/consequences relating to/connected to the 
 marketing, distribution, and pricing food products. After finding some (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) linking guess/guessing 
 and price behavior, Robles, Torero, and von Braun (2009) come to the following end/end result: 
 
 "The excess price rushes caused by guess/guessing and possible collecting could have extreme 
 effects on confidence in worldwide  grain markets, by that/in that way slowing the market's performance 
 in responding to basic changes in supply, demand, and costs of production. More 
 important, they could result in unreasonable or unwanted price ups and downs that can harm 
 the poor and result in long-term, permanent (related to vitamins, protein, etc., in food) damage, especially among children" 
 (p. 7). 
 Given the seriousness of this statement (that someone has done something bad), it is important that (people who work to find information) carefully weigh the scientific 
 (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) (related to/looking at/thinking about) the impact of guessing on valuable thing prices. 
 In this paper, we will review the existing (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) and arguments for a based on guessing/guessed valuable thing 
 bubble. Then, added/more evidence will be presented, where we specifically (ask lots of questions about/try to find the truth about) 
 the (related to studying numbers) relationship between long-only index money and futures prices. Mostly, direct 
 (proof that one thing definitely causes another) relationships will be examined by using a thin sliceal (market) moving backward tests over 
 different horizons. Using Valuable thing Index Trader data from the Valuable thing Futures Trading 
 Commission (CFTC) for 12 markets, simple moving backward tests will be used to test for a planned 
 relationship between index fund positions and returns across markets. The results provide another 
 piece of (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) in this important debate affecting the food production and distribution system. 
 The Arguments 
 It Must be a Bubble! 
 Masters (2008) has led the bubble charge in Government-related hearings, painting the activity of index 
 money as the same as the famous (for bad reasons) Hunt brothers' cornering of the silver market. He blames the fast 
 increase in overall valuable thing prices from 2006-2008 (Figure 1) on institutional (people or businesss who give money to help start businesses)' hug/support 
 of valuable things as an investable valuable thing class. Masters' (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) is limited to stories and the 
 graphical relationship between money flows and prices (Figure 2). 
 Other authors seem to work under the null guess that money-makers have an undesirable and 
 somewhat unexplainable hit/effect on market prices. For instance, Robles, Torero, and von Braun 
 (2009) simply claim that "Changes in supply and demand basics cannot fully explain the 
 recent extreme increase in food prices" (p. 2). (in almost the same way), a study by the Farming-based and Food Policy 
 Center (2008) declares that the "...large inflow of money into the markets, usually long positions, 
 has pushed valuable things to very high levels" and also show a graphical description of 
 investment money in the Goldman Sachs Valuable thing Index (p. 32). 
 While this body of (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) is generally clapped/supported by Government-related members and easily soaked up 
 by the public, it skims over the built-in complex difficulty in futures markets and the patterns of 
 trading. More than that, the lack of difficult/strict/high quality (related to studying numbers) methods generally brings out doubt and distrust in 
 school-related circles. 
 What Bubble? 
 While casual bubble arguments are dishonestly appealing, they do not generally survive close 
 examination. Irwin, Sanders, and Merrin (2009) present three "logical (unexpected differences, missing things, or mistakes)" in the 
 
 2 
 
 arguments made by bubble supporters as well as five events where the bubble story is not 
 agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with watched/followed facts. Here, we will review these arguments and add some scientific 
 (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) to their arguments. 
 The first "logical (unexpected difference, missing thing, or mistake)" within the bubble argument is that money flows are the same as 
 demand. With equally (based on knowledge and learning) market people (who were part of a study, etc.), there is no limit to the number of futures 
 contracts that can be created at a given price level. Index fund buying is no more "new demand" 
 than the similar selling is "new supply." So, money flows in themselves do not 
 necessarily impact prices. Second, there is no (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) that index (people or businesss who give money to help start businesses) distort futures and cash 
 markets. Index (people or businesss who give money to help start businesses) do not participate in the futures delivery process or the cash market where 
 long term balance prices are discovered. Index (people or businesss who give money to help start businesses) are purely involved in a (money-related) 
 transaction using the futures markets, and they do not working at the (instance of buying something for money) or collecting of the 
 cash valuable thing. Because of this, to draw a parallel with the Hunt brother's corner of the silver market is 
 flawed. Lastly, the blanket labeling of money-makers as (people who commit crimes) and hedgers as victims of 
 their actions is mistaken. Many hedgers guess and some money-makers also hedge. It is not clear 
 that there is an easily identified "bad guy." Market patterns are complex, and it is not easy to 
 understand the interaction between the varied market people (who were part of a study, etc.) and their reasons for trading. 
 In their argument of the bubble explanation, Irwin, Sanders, and Merrin (2009) also identify five areas 
 where the bubble story is not agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with the watched/followed facts. First, as Krugman (2008) defends/expresses, 
 if a bubble raises the market price of a storable valuable thing above the true balance price, then 
 stocks of that valuable thing should increase (much like a government (forced (on people)/caused an inconvenient situation) price ceiling can create 
 a extra). Stocks were (lowering in number/getting worse), not building, in most grain markets over 2005-2008, which is 
 not agreeing with/not matching with Krugman's description of a price bubble in these markets. 
 Second, possible models that show (without knowledge/dumb) or noise traders affecting market prices depend on 
 the unpredictable trading patterns of these traders to make (buying and selling quickly to make money) risky (e.g., De Long, Shleifer, 
 Summers, and Waldmann 1990). Because the arbitrage--needed to drive prices to basic 
 value--is not riskless, noise traders can drive a wedge between market prices and basic 
 values. Importantly, index fund buying is very (expected/able to be known beforehand). That is, index money widely publish 
 their (mix of stocks, bonds, etc./document collection) (market) weights and roll-over periods. So, it seems highly unlikely that other 
 large clear traders would wait to trade against an index fund if they were driving prices away 
 from basic values. 
 Third, if index fund buying drove valuable thing prices higher. Then, markets without index money 
 should not have seen prices advance. Again, the watched/followed facts are not agreeing with/not matching with this idea. 
 Irwin, Sanders, and Merrin (2009) show that markets without index fund participation (fluid milk 
 and rice) and valuable things without futures markets (apples and eatable beans) also showed price 
 increases over the 2006-2008 period. This would suggest that there were other macroeconomic 
 factors possibly influencing valuable thing prices. 
 Fourth, guess/guessing is not too much/too many when correctly compared to hedging demands. Working (1960) 
 argued that guess/guessing must be gauged relative to hedging needs. Using Working's based on guessing/guessed 
 "T-index," Sanders, Irwin, and Merrin (2008) (show or prove) that the level of guessing in nine 
 valuable thing futures markets from 2006-2008 ((changing to make better/changing to fit new conditions) for index fund positions) was not too much/too many. 
 In fact, the levels of guessing in all markets examined were within the world of historical normal behaviors. 
 
 3 
 
 Across most markets, the rise in index buying was more than off-set by commercial (hedger) 
 selling. 
 The fifth and final (capable of being seen and known) fact--and the focus of this paper--revolves around the hit/effect of 
 index money across markets. (based on knowledge and not what was seen), there is no reason to expect index money to have a differential 
 hit/effect across markets. That is, if index money can inflate prices, they should have a uniform hit/effect 
 across markets. It is hard to (give reasons for something) why index fund guess/guessing would hit/affect one market, 
 but not another. One would expect markets with the highest concentration of index money positions 
 to show the largest price increases. However, simple (instance of watching, noticing, or making a statement) hints that from 2006-2008, 
 futures markets with the highest concentration of index fund positions (animals markets) showed 
 little or no increase, while those markets with the smallest index fund participation (grains and 
 oilseeds) saw the largest price increases (Irwin, Sanders, and Merrin, 2009). Luckily, this 
 (capable of being seen and known) fact lends itself to a (agreed-upon) test. 
 Here, we test the hit/effect of index fund positions on the thin slice of market returns, 
 providing a more difficult/strict/high quality test of this point. Specifically we scientifically test the relationship 
 between index fund positions and returns across 12 valuable thing futures markets. The null 
 guess that index fund positions do not hit/affect returns across futures markets is tested using 
 data from the CFTC's Valuable thing Index Traders Report and standard thin sliceal time series 
 (moving backwards). 
 Data 
 Valuable thing Index Traders (CIT) Report 
 Starting in 2007, the Valuable thing Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) began reporting the 
 positions held by index traders in 12 farming-based futures markets in the Valuable thing Index Traders 
 (CIT) report, as add to/addition to the usual Promises of Traders (COT) report. According to 
 the CFTC, the index trader positions reflect both (money paid regularly after retirement) money that would have (before that/before now) been 
 classified as non-commercials as well as swap dealers who would have (before that/before now) been classified as 
 commercials hedging OTC transactions involving valuable thing indices. 
 The CFTC easily admits that this classification procedure has flaws and that "...some traders 
 assigned to the Index Traders category are involved in other futures activity that could not be 
 disaggregated....Likewise, the Index Traders category will not include some traders who are 
 working at index trading, but for whom it does not represent a big part of their overall 
 trading activity" (CFTC 2008). (anyway/in any event), the data are an improvement over the more heavily 
 grouped traditional COT classifications, and they should provide a good, although (not totally pure/not totally correct), 
 measure of index trader activity. 
 The CIT data are released along with the usual COT report showing combined futures 
 and options positions. The index trader positions are simply removed from their prior categories 
 and presented as a new category of reporting traders. The CIT data includes the long and short 
 positions held by commercials (less index traders), non-commercials (less index traders), index 
 traders, and non-reporting traders.

 The CIT data are available weekly for the period covering January 3, 2006 through December 30, 
 2008 (157 weekly (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements)). The reports show traders' holdings as of Tuesday's market close. 
 To correspond with these release dates, the Tuesday-to-Tuesday log-relative returns are collected 
 for nearby futures contracts. Markets included in the analysis are as follows: corn, soybeans, 
 soybean oil, Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) wheat, Kansas City Board of Trade (KCBOT) wheat, 
 cotton, live (cows, bulls, etc.), feeder (cows, bulls, etc.), lean hogs, coffee, sugar, and cocoa. 
 Index Trader Participation 
 One of the first (or most important) concerns expressed by the industry is the importance of the valuable thing index 
 activity. In a Barron's article, one analyst joked that "index money account for 40% of all excited 
 bets on valuable things...the index money hold about $211 billion worth of bets on the buy side of U.S. 
 markets." (Epstein 2008). Probably, the huge size of the index fund positions may allow them to 
 distort prices or price relationships across markets. 
 Sanders, Irwin, and Merrin (2008) document that index traders do make up a surprisingly large 
 part of/amount of certain markets. Especially, index traders are over 20% of the open interest in live 
 (cows, bulls, etc.), lean hogs and CBOT wheat. More than that, index money can have a big presence on 
 the long side of the market, coming from/caused by the fact they are "long-only." To illustrate, Figure 3 
 shows the percent of the long positions held by index traders in the cross section of markets 
 examined. 
 It is clear from Figure 3 that the part of/amount of long positions held by index money in each market can 
 change/differ  widely. In the cocoa market, 12% of the long positions were held by index money while over 
 45% of the long positions in the live (cows, bulls, etc.)  futures market were held by index money. As suggested 
 by Masters (2008) and Masters and White (2008), if index fund buying in fact represents new 
 demand and in that way influences market prices, it is reasonable to expect a larger hit/effect in those 
 markets with (compared to other things) larger proportion (demand) of index traders. If not, then it becomes very 
 hard to (give reasons for something) how or why index buying would have a different hit/effect across markets. If 
 index fund buying truly represents new demand, then it should have an hit/effect across all markets. 
 Position Measures 
 Index trader positions are measured in two ways to take by force/take control of both the relative size of the index fund 
 positions and to measure their activity in each market. First, the relative size of the index money is 
 measured by simply using the percent of long positions held in each market (see Figure 3). This 
 serves as a gauge of the relative size of index traders in each market. The percent of long positions 
 is simply calculated as the number of long positions held by index traders divided by the total 
 number of long positions within the market. 
 Following Sanders, Boris, and Manfredo (2004), the percent net long (PNL) is also used to measure 
 the position of traders with in a market, 
 (1) 
 
 Valuable thing Index PNLt = 
 
 CILt a' CIS t 
 CILt + CIS t 
 
 5 
 
 where, CIL is valuable thing index long positions and CIS is valuable thing index short positions. 
 Changes in the PNL for valuable thing index money is used to take by force/take control of moves/changes in their positions within 
 each market. These two measures--percent of long positions and change in the PNL--are used to 
 test for the possible result of index traders across markets. 
 Cross-Sectional Tests 
 Fama-MacBeth Cross-Sectional (moving backwards) 
 
 The relationship between index fund positions and later market returns can be expressed in a 
 thin sliceal moving backward, 
 (2) 
 
 Ri,t+1= Î± + Î²Positionsi,t + ei,t 
 
 The null guess of no market hit/effect is that the slope coefficient,Î², equals zero. An different 
 bubble guess would suggest that Î²&amp;gt;0, such that large index fund positions in market i predict 
 (compared to other things) large later returns in that market. In all (moving backwards), the data are organized such 
 that the (proof that one thing definitely causes another) linkages run from the positions at time t to the later returns in time t+1. 
 Therefore, a finding that Î²a 0 hints that index positions happen before market returns. 
 Fama and MacBeth (1973) propose one method of guessing Î² in (2) that is still widely used in the 
 books (see Campbell, Lo, and MacKinley 1997). With the Fama-MacBeth moving backward procedure, 
 equation (2) is guessed independently for each time period, t=1,2,3,...T, and across the 
 i=1,2,3,...,N markets. The average of the guessed Î²'s is calculated for the T (moving backwards), and it 
 has a standard error of 1/T1/2. To illustrate, Figure 4 shows one of the T (moving backwards) at the quarterly 
 (line in the distance where the Earth and sky meet). In this particular quarter (t=third quarter, 2008), markets that had a (compared to other things) large portion 
 of long positions held by index traders in fact saw (compared to other things) stronger returns in the later 
 period, agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with a bubble-like hit/effect across markets. Other (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements), such as shown in 
 Figure 5 (t=second quarter, 2007), show a negative relationship between index fund positions and 
 returns. The Fama-MacBeth procedure mostly averages the thin sliceal slope coefficient 
 across all of the time series (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) and tests if the average is different from zero. The FamaMacbeth procedure is managed and did/done for weekly, monthly, and quarterly horizons resulting in 156, 35, 
 an 11 thin sliceal (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements), (match up each pair of items in order). 
 The Fama-MacBeth results are presented in Table 1 for equation (2), where positions are 
 represented by the percent of long positions held by index traders. Somewhat surprisingly, the 
 average slope coefficient at each (line in the distance where the Earth and sky meet)  is negative; although, not (related to numbers) different from zero. 
 These results would suggest that if anything, markets with (compared to other things) large index trader positions 
 tend to have (compared to other things) smaller price increases in later time periods. 
 Table 2 presents the results for the Fama-MacBeth (moving backwards) where the (thing that you control (like study time), that causes something else to change (like a test score)) is the 
 change in index fund's PNL position. Here, the results are just like those in Table 1 at the 
 monthly and quarterly (line in the distance where the Earth and sky meet), where the slope coefficients are negative and not (related to numbers) 
 different from zero. A (a) little different result is watched/followed at the weekly (line in the distance where the Earth and sky meet), where the slope 
 coefficient is positive. But, it is still not (related to numbers) different from zero. Together, the Fama- 
 
 6 
 
 MacBeth (moving backwards) provide no (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) that index positions cause differential returns across 
 valuable thing futures markets. 
 Cross-Sectional Time Series (moving backwards) 
 
 Standard cross sectional time series methods are another approach to guessing equation (2). 
 However, this method provides greater flexibility than the Fama-MacBeth approach in terms of 
 model (detailed description of exactly what is required) because time series patterns can also be modeled. Sanders, Irwin, and Merrin 
 (2009) document some low-order positive autocorrelation in valuable thing futures returns. Consistent 
 with that finding, we specify the following model. 
 (3) 
 
 Ri,t+1= Î± + Î²Positionsi,t +Î¸Rt + ei,t 
 
 Where returns in market i at time t+1 are a function of index fund positions and returns from the 
 previous period. White's correction for thin sliceal heteroskedasticity is used to get 
 consistent standard errors in (3). 
 Table 3 presents the cross sectional time series guesses using index money' percent of long 
 positions as the (thing that you control (like study time), that causes something else to change (like a test score)). The results are very agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with the Fama-MacBeth 
 moving backward results in Table 1. The guessed slope coefficients are negative at each (line in the distance where the Earth and sky meet), but they 
 are not (related to numbers) different from zero. So, again, there is no (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) that the cross-market 
 difference/different version in returns is related to long-only index fund positions. Famously, the returns do tend to 
 show some low order positive autocorrelation, Î¸&amp;gt;0. 
 Equation (3) is also guessed with the change in the index fund's PNL as the explanatory (number or thing that changes) 
 (Table 4). At the monthly and quarterly horizons, the guessed beta coefficients are still negative 
 and not (related to numbers) different from zero. However, as in Table 2, the one week (line in the distance where the Earth and sky meet)  has a 
 positive and (only a little bit) significant guessed beta coefficient (p-value =0.06). So, there is some 
 very modest (number-based information that proves something) that the weekly thin sliceal returns may be positively related to 
 the previous/coming before week's change in the index fund positions. The results are only (only a little bit) 
 significant, so they do not provide (very big/very strong) (number-based information that proves something). But, they do raise the 
 possibility that hits/effects may be found over some shorter horizons or with different position 
 measures. 
 Together, the scientific results generally do not reject the null guess that there is no crossmarket relationship between returns and the size of index fund positions. The alone  exception is a 
 not important rejection (p-value = 0.06) at the one week (line in the distance where the Earth and sky meet)  using the move/change in the PNL as the 
 explanatory (number or thing that changes). Otherwise, the relationship between cross market index positions and returns 
 tends to be negative instead of positive. It is hard to (cause agreement with) these results with the 
 statement that index fund buying is new demand in each market. 
 Summary and Ends/end results 
 
 This research examines the cross-market relationship between market returns and positions held by 
 long-only index money. Irwin, Sanders, and Merrin (2009) state that one of the "(not agreeing/not happening in the same way) facts" 
 
 7 
 
 in the bubble explanation for the recent increase and decline in valuable thing markets is that the price 
 increases (decreases) did not happen completely across all markets. That is, if index money drove 
 prices higher, then they should have had an hit/effect in all of the markets, not just select ones. 
 Here, we provide an scientific test of this (not agreeing/not happening in the same way) fact. Specifically, we test if the relative size 
 of index fund positions is related to later returns across markets. A bubble picture/situation would 
 suggest that returns are positively related to relative positions sizes across markets. However, 
 using both Fama-MacBeth and traditional cross sectional tests, the null guess of no crosssectional hit/effect is only rejected in one of twelve models. 
 The (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) that index fund positions hit/effect returns across markets is very little. This leaves a big 
 hole in the bubble argument. If index fund buying represents new demand that drives prices higher, 
 then why doesn't the new demand have an hit/effect in each market? Like all explanations, the bubble 
 explanation claimed in the popular press should be tested based on its ability to (describe the future). In the case 
 of (describing the future) cross sectional returns, the explanation falls short. 
 Statements that money-makers drive prices beyond basic value and disrupt important 
 people-helping efforts have been the spark for recent law-based proposals designed to control 
 guess/guessing in valuable thing futures markets. Given the importance of money-makers in a well 
 functioning (place where people buy things) it is important the policy-makers think about/believe the whole body of (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) with 
 regard to the hit/effect of money-makers on market prices. 
 Almost all evidence presented by school-related (people who work to find information) does not find any 
 relationship between positions held by large traders and later price behavior (e.g., Bryant, 
 Bessler, and Haigh 2006; Gorton, Hayashi, and Rouwenhorst 2007; Sanders, Irwin, and Merrin 
 2009). Those that do find some (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) (e.g., Robles, Torero, and Braun 2009) often use nonstandard ways of doing things or data (e.g., cash or index prices). Therefore, even though the arguments made 
 by bubble supporters are obviously appealing to the non-money-flow expert, they do not stand on a firm 
 scientific footing. While difficult/strict/high quality scientific studies cannot prevent a based on guessing/guessed hit/effect on 
 valuable thing prices, the body of (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) certainly does not support that end/end result. Law-makers and 
 public policy talkers would be well-served to let this (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) guide their actions.
