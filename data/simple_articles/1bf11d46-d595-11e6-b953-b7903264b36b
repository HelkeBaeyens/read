 Abstract 
 Brennan, J.P., 1989. Spillover produces of international farming-based research: CIMMYT-based semidwarfwheats in Australia. Agric. Econ., 3: 323-332. 
 The spillover effects of farming-based research are of interest because research-caused supply 
 moves/changes in non-target areas can reduce the benefits for producers in the target areas. The introduction of semi-dwarfing (tiny chemical assembly instructions inside of living things)  in wheat into Australia provides an example of spillover from the 
 CIMMYT program. Australia's wheat-growing (surrounding conditions) were not those for which the CIMMYT material was specifically targeted. However, some of these lines were introduced into Australia and used in breeding programs to produce important supply moves/changes in Australia. An examination is made of the effects that the spillover had in Australia. 
 Using an index of varietal improvement, with its related qualifications, an guess of the 
 extent of that shift resulting from the CIMMYT -based varieties was gotten. While the extent 
 varied widely between states, the shift was found to be between 0.2 and 7.7%, with an overall 
 average for Australia of 3.5% by 1983. On the basis of an idea (you think is true) of perfectly elastic export 
 demand for Australian wheat, the guessed total cost savings to Australian producers were US$747 
 million (in 1983-84 dollars) for the period 1974 to 1983, or an average ofUS$75 million per year. 
 The once-a-year (thing that's given/work that's done) of Australia to CIMMYT has averaged about US$340,000 in 
 the last few years, while the average once-a-year expense on wheat breeding in Australia has been US$4 
 to 5 million. On the basis of (proof of coming from an excellent family)s, about two-thirds of the cost savings of CIMMYTbased varieties could be attributed to CIMMYT (by itself/in and of itself), with the remaining one-third attributable 
 to the inputs of the Australian wheat people (who help animals have babies). 
 
 Introduction 
 Mexican dwarf wheat varieties (at first/before other things happened) were developed by the Cooperative 
 Wheat Improvement Program of the Mexican Ministry of Farming and the 
 Rockefeller Foundation "to solve Mexico's wheat production problem" 
 (CIMMYT, 1969, p. 55). Later research has been carried out by CIMMYT in Mexico to develop "high-cooperating with/producing/giving up, widely changed/ready, semidwarf spring0169-5150/89/$03.50

 habit bread wheats that were good for immediate release in key developing 
 countries" ( CIMMYT, 1984, p. 11). The varieties developed have been grown 
 in many areas apart from the 'target' areas in the developing countries. 
 The net benefits of farming-based research in a tradable valuable thing such as 
 wheat for its 'target' area are influenced by the spillover of the effects of that 
 research into the rest of the world, with which the target area competes for 
 a share of the world market. Edwards and Freebairn ( 1984) showed that the 
 greater the extent to which the research inventions of new things are adopted in other areas, the lower the net benefits for the target area. Davis et al. (1987) have 
 further developed including spillover effects into the (related to careful studying or deep thinking) 
 (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) for the test of research. 
 In this paper, the effects of wheat research at CIMMYT on the production 
 from the generally dryland areas in Australia are identified. An attempt is 
 made to number the extent of those spillover effects from the CIMMYT 
 program. 
 Semi-dwarf wheats in Australia 
 Semi-dwarf wheats were first introduced into Australia from the United 
 States of America in 1956 (Pugsley, 1974). From the late 1950s and early 1960s, 
 material was also imported from the Mexican program conducted by the Rockefeller Foundation, predictor of the CIMMYT program. The imported lines

 were not released directly for commercial growing by Australian farmers (generally because of not enough milling or baking quality). All were subject to 
 further crossing before commercial varieties were released. This delayed the 
 initial adoption of semi-dwarf wheats in Australia compared to most other 
 countries (Brennan, 1986a). The first semi-dwarf bread wheat cultivars were 
 released for commercial production in Australia in 1973. 
 In this paper Australian varieties which had a CIMMYT line in their parents are classified as CIMMYT -based varieties. Between 1973 and 1984, 58 
 new wheat varieties were released for commercial production in Australia; of 
 these, 45 (or 78%) were CIMMYT-based varieties, seven (12%) were semidwarfs of other origin, and six (10%) were non-semi-dwarf. The spread of 
 CIMMYT -based varieties in Australia from the first release was fast-see 
 Brennan (1986a) for more detail. By 1976, over 14% of the total Australian 
 wheat area was spread around to CIMMYT -based varieties. By 1983 the percentage had 
 reached 45%, or 5.8 million ha, and a further 8% was spread around to semi-dwarfs of 
 other origin. There were wide differences in the rate of adoption in different 
 states (Fig. 1). 
 Produce advantage of CIMMYT-based varieties 
 
 Although almost all semi -dwarfs released commercially in Australia have 
 involved selection from, or further crossing with, CIMMYT material, other 
 parts/faces of progress in breeding have been incorporated at the same time. So, 
 in a perfect world, the study should make a comparison between the progress (in yield 
 and quality) which has actually happened in the presence of CIMMYT material 
 and that which would have happened without it. 
 A few simplifying ideas (you think are true) were made in guessing the produce advantage of CIMMYT-based varieties over other varieties, including (a) that the

 CIMMYT-based varieties led to a permanent upward move/change in yield potential: 
 (b) that the produce advantage from trials can be used to point to/show the produce advantages on farms; (c) that the produce advantage of CIMMYT -based breeding 
 lines over other leading lines in the Interstate Wheat Variety Trials over the 
 period 1975-1982 gave/given a measure of the built-in produce advantage of CIMMYT-based varieties; and (d) that the varieties chosen by people (who help animals have babies) as standard check varieties in the trials do in fact represent the standard in each state, 
 and that the lines being compared are representative of the new wheats in the 
 process of being released. 
 The procedure for guessing the produce advantage for CIMMYT-based varieties, as described/explained by Brennan (1986a), was as follows. The (proof of coming from an excellent family) of each 
 line in the Interstate Wheat Variety Trials was examined and was classified as 
 'CIMMYT-based' if either of its parents was from the CIMMYT program or 
 had CIMMYT material in its parents. The mean yields for the 'CIMMYTbased' and the 'other' groups were then calculated for all trial places/locations in each 
 state for each year between 1975 and 1982. The overall average yield of each 
 group was then guessed for each state for the full period from a weighted 
 average of the once-a-year mean yields. In total, data covered 176 site-years, with 
 an average of 25 lines at each site and an average of four places/locations per state per 
 year. 
 The overall average advantage of CIMMYT -based lines over other lines was 
 7.1% (Table 1), although there was wide (quality of changing over time or at different places) between states. The ranking of these mean produce advantages by state is broadly in line with the rate of 
 adoption of CIMMYT-based varieties in each state. 
 Index of varietal improvement 
 
 Given the average produce advantages for each state, and the data on adoption 
 of the varieties, it is possible to calculate a simplified relative yield index or 
 'index of varietal improvement' (Silvey, 1981; Brennan, 1984). This index 
 combines the yields received/got in trials with data on the varieties being grown 
 by farmers, to provide a measure of the (thing that's given/work that's done) that new varieties make 
 to increasing wheat yields. 
 A changed index of varietal improvement is calculated as follows: 
 lit= 100+ (Vi Pit) /100 
 
 where lit is the index in state i in year t; Vi is the percentage produce advantage 
 of CIMMYT-based varieties in state i; and Pit is the proportion of the area 
 spread around to CIMMYT-based varieties in state i in year t. This way in New South 
 Wales, with a produce advantage of9.0% (Vi=9.0), and 71.0% of the area spread around 
 to CIMMYT-based varieties in 1979 (Pit=0.710), the index for 1979 is 106.39. 
 The index has a base value of 100 for all years in which these varieties were 
 not grown in the state. 
 
 327 
 
 These indexes have been calculated for each state for each year from 1974 
 to 1983. The index increases steadily for each state with the increasing adoption of these varieties. The index increased between 1973 and 1983 by 6.6% for 
 New South Wales, 5.3% for Victoria, 7.2% for Queensland, 2.4% for South 
 Australia and 0.3% for Western Australia. The overall increase over this period 
 for Australia was 3.6%. 
 Godden ( 1985, 1987) pointed out that relative yield indexes are a (created unfair thinking in)/(unfair-thinking) 
 estimator of (related to tiny chemical assembly instructions inside of living things) improvement unless there is no interaction between the 
 varieties and the level of inputs used. A brief examination of input levels in 
 Australia (Brennan, 1986a) showed that, except in Western Australia (where 
 CIMMYT -based varieties were only of minor importance), there was very little 
 (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) of any major changes in input levels for wheat production in Australian over the period since the early 1970s. This way the extent of the possible bias 
 in this study, while unknown, is argued to be likely to be (compared to other things) small. 
 On the other hand, if the CIMMYT-based varieties were adopted mainly in 
 the areas where their (quality of being better than everything else) over other varieties was greatest, then the 
 index of varietal improvement would understate the true (thing that's given/work that's done) of these 
 CIMMYT-based varieties. Given the other limits on the quality of this 
 index, it is not appropriate to attempt to guess the size of this bias. Anyway, it is a possible further source of mistake in the results of this study. 
 Guess of move/change in Australia's wheat supply curve 
 
 Edwards and Freebairn ( 1984) define the increase in supply as a up-and-down 
 downwards move/change in the supply curve through a lowering of costs per unit. An 
 guess of the equal percentage reduction in costs for a given percentage yield increase can be gotten from the change in the index of varietal 
 improvement. If the cost of growing the not important hectare is C and the yields 
 are Y(tlha), the not important tonne of production will cost CIYper t. If the yield 
 increases by the proportion A with no increase in costs per ha, then the cost 
 energetic  falls to CI [_( Y ( 1 +A) ]_) , and the (fair in amount, related to something else/properly sized compared to something else) fall in costs energetic  is A I (1 +A). 
 So, a costless (in terms perceived directly by farmers) increase in yields 
 of 3.6% for Australia is equal to a fall in costs of 3.5%. This is the extent 
 to which the overall Australian supply curve is guessed to have shifted downwards as a spillover from the Mexican wheat breeding programs. The shift this way 
 calculated for each state was: Queensland 6.7%, New South Wales 6.2%, Victoria 5.0%, South Australia 2.4% and Western Australia 0.2%. 
 Effect on prices for Australian wheat 
 
 It is possible that the increased supply resulting from the semi-dwarfs in 
 Australia has affected the prices received for Australia's wheat exports. If the 
 t, metric tonne= 1000 kg. 
 
 328 
 
 export market is perfectly elastic (that is, Australia is a price-taker on the 
 world wheat market), the increased supply would not have influenced world 
 prices. However, there is some debate as to whether Australia faces a perfectly 
 elastic demand for its export wheat; for example, see Alaouze et al. ( 1978a,b, 
 1979), Grennes and Johnson (1979) andLongworthandKnopke (1982). The 
 analysis in the present study is based on the idea (you think is true) that the export demand is perfectly elastic, as argued by Alaouze et al. (1978a,b) and Longworth 
 and Knapke ( 1982). To the extent that the market is less than perfectly elastic, 
 the increased supply would have reduced the price, and the gains pointed to/showed by 
 this analysis would be overstated. 
 Also, the large moves/changes in world wheat supply (measured as increases 
 in world production) attributed to varieties coming from CIMMYT 
 (Anderson et al., 1987) can have really affected the world price 
 for wheat (Edwards and Freebairn, 1984). These effects could have big 
 disbenefits for Australian producers, offset a little bit by benefits for Australian people. These effects are not guessed in this paper. 
 Guess of cost savings for Australia 
 If the idea (you think is true) is made that Australia is a price-taker on the world wheat 
 market, facing perfectly elastic demand, then the figures received/made from in this study 
 allow some broad guesses to be made of the cost savings to Australian producers from CIMMYT-based varieties. This involves continuing the earlier

 ideas (you think are true) that the produce advantage of CIMMYT-based varieties in trials is 
 the same as that on farms for each state, and that there are no major interactions of these varieties with changes in inputs during the period of analysis. 
 On the basis of these a few ideas (you think are true), the once-a-year savings to Australian 
 wheatgrowers are guessed (in 1983-84 US dollars) as shown in Table 2. Details of the calculations hidden (under) these ideas (you think are true) are given in Brennan 
 (1986a). These figures show big savings for Australian producers. After 
 the first small savings during the early adoption phase, the once-a-year savings 
 reached US$113 million in 1979, fell to US$34 million in the drought-affected 
 season of 1982, and increased to US$142 million in 1983. In the period 1974 to 
 1983, total savings in 1983-84 dollars, compounded at a real interest rate of 
 5% per year, were US$747 million, or an average ofUS$75 million per year. 
 Separating (things that are given/work that's done) 
 
 The savings of the CIMMYT-based varieties cannot all be attributed to 
 CIMMYT, since many of these varieties have large inputs of germplasm and 
 breeding, test and testing useful things/valuable supplies from Australian wheat (people who work to find information). 
 It is of interest to examine the relative (thing that's given/work that's done) of the CIMMYT and Australian research programs to these cost savings. 
 A simplified separations of CIMMYT and non-CIMMYT savings uses the 
 (proof of coming from an excellent family) of each variety to set apart the savings for each according to the origins

 of its parents (see Brennan, 1986a, for more details). This way a variety which is 
 a direct cross between a CIMMYT line and an Australian line has 50% of its 
 saving attributed to CIMMYT. A variety which is the product of a cross between two CIMMYT lines is set apart and given out 100% to CIMMYT, even though the 
 crossing, selection, test and testing were all carried out in Australia. 
 Such an portion is random, and understates the value added by the Australian (people who work to find information) in testing and release of the varieties. Anyway, calculations have been carried out on this basis to provide an indication of the (thing that's given/work that's done) of CIMMYT to the hit/effect of CIMMYT -based varieties in Australia 
 (Brennan, 1986a). The weighted average of the (thing that's given/work that's done) of CIMMYT 
 peaked at US$80 million in 1980 (Table 3) and (lowered in number/got worse/gotten worse) to US$66 million (or 
 46% of the (thing that's given/work that's done) of CIMMYT -based varieties) by 1983 as the varieties 
 grown in Australia moved further away from the original material imported 
 from CIMMYT. The CIMMYT (thing that's given/work that's done) averaged about US$50 
 million per year, or 67% ofthe total cost savings from CIMMYT-based varieties over the period 1974 to 1983 (Table 3). Although this analysis is no more 
 than indicative, the CIMMYT program appears to have made a big 
 direct and indirect (thing that's given/work that's done) to Australian wheat production, mainly through 
 the use of CIMMYT lines as parents. (after that), the new varieties have 
 been used as parents in further Australian-developed varieties. 
 Therefore, overall, about two-thirds of the supply shift due to CIMMYT-based varieties could be attributed to CIMMYT and one-third to Australian people (who help animals have babies). This reduces the direct cost savings to 2.3%, rather than 3.5% 
 guessed above for the CIMMYT -based varieties as a whole. 
 Ends/end results 
 
 While the aims of the Rockefeller /CIMMYT programs may not have always 
 appeared to be to the direct benefit of Australian producers, there is (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) 
 that Australian producers have received important cost savings from the programs in terms of increased yields. These savings appear to far outweigh the 
 (thing that's given/work that's done) of the Australian Government to CIMMYT. Since 1977, Australia has added/has given an average of some US$2.8 million per year to core programs of the Consulative Group in International Farming-based Research Center. Of this, some 12% has gone to CIMMYT and no more than one-half of 
 that support went to its wheat program (J.R. Anderson, personal communication, 1986). This way on a once-a-year outlay of some US$340,000, Australia has 
 received overall cost reductions averaging some US$75 million per year resulting from improved wheat varieties came/coming from CIMMYT. This compares with 
 an average once-a-year expense on wheat breeding in Australia of US$4 to 5 
 million (Brennan, 1986b). 
 These programs appear to have led to big supply moves/changes in other pro- 
 
 331 
 
 clueing countries, which have worsened/decreased the world wheat price. 
 Whether the net effect of these programs on Australian wheat producers is 
 positive cannot be judged until the hit/effect of these moves/changes in supply in other 
 producing countries on the world wheat price has been identified. However, 
 any such hits/effects will have been harmful for Australian producers (answered to/fought by smaller benefits for Australian people), and will be very different from the 
 effects identified in this paper. 
 These guesses are only an guess, but they do show/tell about that there 
 can be big spillover effects from international farming-based research 
 programs in which there is free exchange of breeding material and wide access 
 to breeding nurseries. If Australian production has not significantly affected 
 world prices, then these spillover effects will not have reduced the benefits for 
 producers in the areas targeted by the international programs. On the other 
 hand, if the export ability to stretch for Australian wheat was limited, the spillover of 
 these varieties into Australia will have resulted in a fall in world price, this way 
 moving (from one place to another) some of the benefits from the producers to world wheat people.
