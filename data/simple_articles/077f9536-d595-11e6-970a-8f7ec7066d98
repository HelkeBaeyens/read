 Abstract 
 The (wasting very little while working or producing something) of women fanners in the farming-based part/area of developing countries is emotionally (discussed back and forth). Very few studies have 
 examined this issue in African farming. All previous studies were based on production functions, but have been criticised as suffering 
 from (happening together) equation bias because the input levels are endogenous. The profit function method avoids these problems. No previous 
 study has used the profit function method to test for technical, allocative and money-based (wasting very little while working or producing something) differences between women and men 
 farmers. The goal of this paper was to decide/figure out whether women rice farmers are less (producing a lot with very little waste) than men rice farmers in Cote d 'Jvoire 
 using the restricted (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy)ised profit function method. Our results show that the relative degree of (wasting very little while working or producing something) of women is just like that of 
 men. The paper provides scientific support for efforts to eliminate bias against women fanners in African farming. 
 
 1. Introduction 
 
 The importance of women farmers in the farming of developing countries is widely recognised 
 (Boserup, 1970; Gladwin, 1991; Le1e, 1991). Women 
 provide a significant share of the labour (both family 
 and hired) for farm activities (Dixon, 1982), and are 
 important as first (or most important) producers of food crops (They, 
 1984; Dozon, 1985; FAO, 1985; Savane, 1985; 
 Weekes-Vagliani, 1985). Studies have shown that 
 women also play big parts in farm-level decisionmaking, either as farm managers managing their own 
 fields (Moock, 1976) or as 'effective decisionmakers' even in families in which the household

 head is a male, either because of their clearly stated/particular skills 
 or when the husbands are (not there; not present) for longer periods 
 because they are employed in city-based  areas (Quisumbing, 1994). 
 (even though there is the existence of) their importance, women farmers face 
 difficult/scary restrictions to their working well, arising 
 from limited access to extension, to capital markets, 
 and to new technologies (Birkhaeuser et al., 1991; 
 Bindlish and Evenson, 1993; They, 1984; Quisumbing, 1994; FAO, 1985). An argument often used 
 against female farmers is that they are less (producing a lot with very little waste) 
 than male farmers (FAO, 1985). (wasting very little while working or producing something) has three 
 parts/pieces: technical, allocative and money-based. 
 Technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) can be defined as the ability to 
 (accomplish or gain with effort) a higher level of output, given a almost the same  level 
 of production inputs. Allocative (wasting very little while working or producing something) has to do 
 with the extent to which farmers make (producing a lot with very little waste) 
 decisions by using inputs up to the level at which 
 their not important (thing that's given/work that's done) to production value is

 equal to the factor cost. Money-based (wasting very little while working or producing something) combines technical and allocative (wasting very little while working or producing something). It is possible for a firm to have either technical or allocative 
 (wasting very little while working or producing something) without having money-based (wasting very little while working or producing something). 
 Technical and allocative (wasting very little while working or producing something) are necessary, 
 and when they happen together, are (good) enough conditions for (accomplishing or gaining) money-based (wasting very little while working or producing something) (Yotopoulos 
 and Nuggent, 1976). 
 Whether men are (producing more with less waste) than women in 
 farm production is emotionally (discussed back and forth). Only few 
 studies have examined this issue in Africa (Moock, 
 1976, Kenya; Saito et al., 1992, Kenya and Nigeria; 
 Bindlish and Evenson, 1993, Kenya; Bindlish et al., 
 1993, Burkina Faso; Udry et al., 1995, Burkina 
 Faso), often with changeable results. Using CobbDouglas production functions with dummy (numbers that change/things that change) 
 to represent the (male/female status) of either the field owner 
 (Moock, 1976; Saito et al., 1992) or the head of the 
 household (Saito et al., 1992; Bindlish and Evenson, 
 1993; Bindlish et al., 1993), these studies found that 
 the coefficient of the (male/female status) dummy (number or thing that changes) was 
 unimportant in Kenya (Moock, 1976; Saito et al., 
 1992; Bindlish and Evenson, 1993) and Burkina 
 Faso (Bindlish et al., 1993). Results for Nigeria were 
 mixed, with the (male/female status) (number or thing that changes) not significant when 
 data for total farm output at the household level were 
 used but were much higher for men when the 
 total value of production at the plot level was used 
 (Saito et al., 1992). Udry et al. (1995) examined 
 (male/female status)-based working well differences in Burkina 
 Faso and found that output per hectare was lower on 
 plots controlled by women. However, such differences in working well cannot be taken as a strong sign of 
 production inefficiency. When corrections were made 
 for the differences in input type and quality, the 
 authors noted that "The (male/female status) yield differential, 
 (based on what's seen or what seems obvious), is caused by the difference in the strength with which measured inputs of labour, poop/fertilizer 
 and fertiliser are applied on plots controlled by men 
 and women rather than by differences in the (wasting very little while working or producing something) with which these inputs are used" (p. 416). In 
 production function guesses for all crops, (grass grown for food) 
 and vegetables (a crop in which women (focused on doing one thing very well)), 
 Udry et al. (1995) found that except in the case of 
 (grass grown for food), the coefficient on the (male/female status) (number or thing that changes) was 
 not significant. 
 Criticisms of these studies have pointed out that 
 the reliance on production function methods to test 
 
 for allocative and money-based (wasting very little while working or producing something) suffers from 
 problems of (happening at the same time) bias because input levels 
 are endogenously decided/figured out (Quisumbing, 1994). 
 In a complete review of (the best design available now) studies 
 on (male/female status) and farm (wasting very little while working or producing something), Quisumbing ( 1994) 
 noted that such ''problems of endogeneity can be 
 avoided by guessing (money made/good thing received) or cost functions instead 
 of production functions" (p. 8). Although applications of profit function analysis are long/big in the 
 (wasting very little while working or producing something) books (Yotopoulos and Lau, 1973; Lau, 
 1976; Khan and Maki, 1979; Saleem, 1988; Duraisamy, 1990), studies have not used this approach 
 to examine (wasting very little while working or producing something) differences between men and 
 women farmers ( Quisumbing, 1994). This partly reflects the lack of appropriate (male/female status)-disaggregated 
 field data. Given that rice in West Africa is often 
 referred to as a 'woman's crop' -because of the 
 importance of women as first (or most important) producers and decision-makers on the rice fields (They, 1984; Carney, 
 1988)-it offers itself as an interesting crop with 
 which to examine this question. The goal of the 
 paper was to decide/figure out, using the restricted (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy)ised profit function method (Yotopoulos and Lau, 
 1973; Lau, 1976), whether female rice farmers are 
 less (producing a lot with very little waste) than male rice farmers in Cote d 'Ivoire. 
 
 2. Data 
 The (male/female status)-disaggregated data used for the analysis were collected in 1993-1994 from a random 
 sample of 347 men and 63 women rice farmers in 
 three districts of northern Cote d'Ivoire. The data 
 covered fertiliser applications, labour use (family and 
 hired), access to extension and credit, farm size, 
 paddy prices, wages, fertiliser prices, capital valuable things 
 and the farmers' education level (Table 1). We found 
 no a big difference in the access of women to 
 extension services; 98% of the men have access to 
 extension compared with 91% of the women farmers. A big differences were found in access to 
 education and credit, however. Only 2% of the female farmers are educated (i.e. have ever attended 
 school) compared with 21% of the male farmers. 
 Women are also at a disadvantage in their access to 
 credit services. Eighty-six percent of men farmers 
 have access to credit compared with only 59% of the 
 women. Women also appear to receive less for their

 output than men: the average price received for 
 paddy by men was 71 CFA kg- 1 , compared with a 
 mean farm-gate price of 62 CFA kg- 1 for women. 
 We did not watch/notice any differences in quality or 
 grade of output between men and women farmers. 
 The higher prices received/got by men may reflect the 
 fact that men are better organised into farmer cooperatives than women, differences in the timing of 
 sales or the type of market outlets used. 
 No a big differences were seen in the use of 
 chemical fertiliser. Men applied 148 kg NPK ha- 1 
 compared with 126 kg ha- 1 for women, whereas the 
 application of urea was 70 kg ha- 1 for the men and 
 73 kg ha- 1 for women. Average expense on the 
 use of other inputs (i.e. insecticides and herbicides) 
 was almost the same  for both men and women farmers; women 
 spent an average of 15 600 CFA ha- 1 on these 
 inputs compared with II 200 CFA ha- 1 for men. 
 Women in the sample also have access to the use of 
 mechanised equipments (i.e. oxen or tractors) mainly 
 through an equipment rental market that is active in 
 the area of study. Average yields received/got by 
 female farmers was 1.5 kg ha -I compared with 2.0 
 kg ha- 1 for the male farmers. However, mean values, by hiding the big inter-farm (quality of changing over time or at different places) 
 in yields, useful thing/valuable supply gifts, and factor-use proportions across fields of female and male farmers, 
 
 Using the output price as the numeraire, the (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy)ised restricted profit function ( 7T * (q,Z)) can be 
 written in a generalised form as 
 7T' ( 
 
 q,Z) =

 where qj represents the (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy)ised factor prices, F 
 is a well behaved production function, X is the 
 vector of changeable inputs and Z is the vector of fixed 
 inputs used in the production process. Starting with 
 any well specified (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy)ised restricted profit function, direct application of Hottelings-Shephard' s 
 Lemmas to the function yields the similar 
 factor demand and output supply equations 
 
 o7r'(q,Z)joqj= -X/

 Eqs. (I) and (3) form the possible basis for the

 previous studies (Lau and Y otopoulos, 1971; Khan

 the (detailed description of exactly what is required) of the systems of equations of the

 that the errors of the system of equations are (serving to add something) 
 with zero mean and limited variance. For the same 
 farm, the co-variance of the error terms in these 
 equations are nonzero, while the co-variance of error 
 terms of any of the equations for different farms are 
 assumed to be zero. Following previous studies, 
 Zellners' (appearing to be) unrelated moving backward method 
 (SUR) was used to guess the system of equations 
 in order to get asymptotically (producing a lot with very little waste) limit/guideline 
 guesses. 
 The results of the guessed equations are presented in Table 2. The coefficients all have the 
 expected possible signs and nine of the ten (numbers that change/things that change) are significant at between the 5% and 1% 
 levels. As is possibly consistent, the coefficients 
 of the prices for fertiliser and labour are negatively 
 signed as expected. Capital and land are highly 
 significant in the profit function. 
 The guesses tested and their results are shown 
 in Table 3. All tests are tested at the 5% level of

 importance. Guess one (HI) states that the 
 money-based (wasting very little while working or producing something) (technical and price or allocative (wasting very little while working or producing something)) of men and women farmers are 
 equal. This guess cannot be rejected. The second guess (H2) states that the relative price or 
 allocative (wasting very little while working or producing something) of men and women farmers is 
 equal, (in other words) they equate the value of not important product 
 of labour to wage rate and the value of not important 
 product of fertiliser to fertiliser price to the same 
 degree. Although the guess being tested is the 
 (state where all things are equal) of the elasticities of the changeable inputs of 
 men and women in the factor share equations, the 
 test is better idea-basedised as (a/ m - ei * ) = (a/ f 
 - 8/ ), for i = I ,2. This guess cannot be rejected. Guess three (H3) states that there is 
 equal relative technical and price (wasting very little while working or producing something) both/together 
 between men and women farmers. This guess 
 cannot be rejected. This is not surprising given the 
 test results of HI and H2. Guess four (H4) 
 states that men farmers have total allocative or 
 price (wasting very little while working or producing something), (in other words) they (make as big as possible) makes money by equating the value of each factor's not important product to the 
 
 51 
 
 (pertaining to each person or thing) factor price. This guess is rejected. 
 Guess five (H5) states that women farmers have 
 total allocative (wasting very little while working or producing something). This guess cannot 
 be rejected for the female sample. Guess six 
 (H6) states that there are constant returns to scale 
 under the maintained guess of total price 
 (wasting very little while working or producing something) for men and women farmers (and this way of 
 equal relative price (wasting very little while working or producing something)). This guess is 
 rejected. There is (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) of decreasing returns to 
 scale for the hidden (under) technology on the farms of 
 both men and women farmers. 
 To decide/figure out the effects of individual production 
 factors on paddy output for the sample farmers, we 
 used identities that link the self-dual profit function 
 with the emotional  production function (Sidhu, I 97 4; 
 Yotopoulos et a!., 1976; Duraisamy, 1990). It has 
 been shown (Yotopoulos and Lau, 1973) that the 
 indirect production elasticities for the changeable inputs 
 can be came/coming from the self-dual profit function 
 used above, as a 1 = -a/ (I - /.L * )- 1 , where a/ 
 goes along with the guessed limits/guidelines of the factor 
 prices of these (numbers that change/things that change) in the dual profit function, 
 and /.L * = &#126; a/ . The elasticities of the fixed factors 
 are figured out/calculated as 31{ = - f3/ (1 - /.L' )- 1 , where 31{ is 
 the indirect ability to stretch of production with respect to 
 the fixed factor. These indirect production ability to stretch 
 guesses have been shown to have (related to studying numbers) (state of always working or appearing the same way) (Sidhu, I 974). Using the combined sample of 
 farmers (male and female) we guessed these indirect production elasticities. Our guesses (Table 4) 
 show that the ability to stretch of paddy output is highest 
 with respect to labour (0.42), followed by fertilisers 
 (0.27), land (0.20), and capital (0.04). An increase of 
 labour use by I 0% will increase paddy output by 
 4.2%. (in almost the same way), a 10% increase in fertiliser, land, 
 and capital is expected to lead to 2.7%, 2.0% and

 0.4% increases in paddy output. The highly inelastic 
 response to land and capital may reflect the presence 
 of other (related to computers and science) and infrastructural restrictions 
 that limit rice working well. These results also show 
 that labour is the most limiting factor in rice production, suggesting that the technologies that improve 
 the working well of labour are likely to (accomplish or gain with effort) significant positive effects on rice production.

 4. Ends/end results 
 This paper presents the results of an scientific 
 application of the profit function method to test for 
 (wasting very little while working or producing something) differences between men and women 
 farmers in African farming. Such an application 
 was called for in a recent complete review of 
 the books on (male/female status) and farm (wasting very little while working or producing something) 
 (Quisumbing, 1994). Especially, the results suggest 
 that (big statements based on very little information) on (wasting very little while working or producing something) or otherwise of 
 men and women farmers should be avoided as this 
 would be wrong at best: (wasting very little while working or producing something) is often dependent on the location and big picture  of the farming-based systems. We found that the relative degree of 
 money-based (wasting very little while working or producing something) of women rice farmers is just like that of men rice farmers in Cote d'lvoire. 
 Results show that women farmers have total 
 allocative (wasting very little while working or producing something) in the use of the inputs at their 
 disposal, although this did not translate into having 
 higher money-based (wasting very little while working or producing something) due possibly to lack of 
 better technical options. Also, (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) from the 
 field survey show that men farmers can get 
 higher prices for their rice than women, a situation 
 that may reflect the better organisation of men farmers into cooperatives. 
 One major reason for the neglect of women in 
 rice development projects in West Africa is the 
 wrong, yet widespread, idea (you think is true) that female 
 farmers are less (producing a lot with very little waste) than male farmers. So, 
 even in areas of West Africa where women are the 
 traditional rice growers, and rice is carefully thought about/believed as a 
 woman's crop, rice development projects choose to 
 focus on men and not women (They, 1981, 1984). 
 Results from this paper suggest that there is no 
 money-based reasons for (unfairly influencing an opinion) rice development 
 plans towards male farmers in Cote d'Ivoire, as 
 female farmers, when they have access to almost the same 
 inputs, have equal levels of money-based (wasting very little while working or producing something).
