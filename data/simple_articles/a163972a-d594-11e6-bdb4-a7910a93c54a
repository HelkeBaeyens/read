 Abstract 
 
 The relationship between the (money-related) structure of a marketing cooperative (MC) and the 
 needed thing of the rule of control by the members is analysed from a transaction costs 
 (way of seeing things / sensible view of what is and is not important). A MC receives less good terms on outside equity than a ordinary firm 
 because the decision power (related to/looking at/thinking about) new investments is not gave out to the providers of 
 these money. This is a serious threat to the survival of a MC in a market where (producing a lot with very little waste) 
 investments are seen as an increasing level of valuable thing level of detail at the processing stage 
 of production. A MC is (described the future) to be an (producing a lot with very little waste) organizational form when the level of valuable thing 
 level of detail at the processing stage of production is at a low or immediate level compared to the 
 level of valuable thing level of detail at the farming stage of production.

 MARKETING COOPERATIVES AND FINANCIAL STRUCTURE: 
 A TRANSACTION COSTS PERSPECTIVE 
 
 1 
 
 Introduction 
 
 The depature of this article is the (instance of watching, noticing, or making a statement) that a few farming-based and (plant-related) 
 marketing cooperatives (MCs) are thinking about a change or have (not very long ago) changed their 
 organizational and (money-related) structure.1 Some MCs are moving in the direction of a 
 ordinary, (money made/good thing received) making the most of firm by issuing some kind of equity (i.e. leaving alone (and forgetting) the onemember-one-vote feature) and/or are relaxing the uniform treatment of the members. 
 Zwanenberg et.al. (1992) report about Kerry (1987), Avonmore (1988), Waterford 
 (1988), and Golden Valley/life (1992) in Ireland. Examples in the Netherlands are reported by 
 Campina Melkunie (1991) about the introduction of members' participation units at 
 Campina Melkunie in 1991, Zwanenberg (1992) about the stock market listing of 
 pharmacist cooperative OPG in 1992, NRC Handelsblad (1994) about the introduction of 
 shares for members at dairy cooperative Friesland Frico Domo in 1994 and the merger and 
 stock market listing of ten fruits and flowers sales (Greenery) in 1995.The coming into view of 
 New Generation Cooperatives in the United States of America involves a readjustation of the 
 activities of MCs in placing demands of people for farming-based and (plant-related) products 
 at center stage (Cook, 1995). 
 Two parts of farming-based and (plant-related) markets have changed in the course of 
 time: shortage markets and (good) enough internal money. First, farming-based and (plant-related) 
 1 
 
 This article is concerned with one-product cooperatives. Many cooperatives in Europe and California 
 are like this. Cooperatives in for example the Midwest of the United States of America are quite different. 
 
 2 
 
 markets have changed from shortage to extra markets. Folmer et. al. (1995, p.40-41) 
 measure the extent of shortage markets by calculating independence ratios for the (related to Europe) 
 Union in 1990 of 1.29 for wheat, 1.13 for rough grains, 1.39 for sugar, .51 for oilseeds, 
 1.08 for wine, 1.11 for beef, 1.09 for cheese, 1.21 for butter and 1.40 for skimmed milkpowder. So, many farming-based and (plant-related) markets are now/recently extra instead of 
 shortage markets. These markets require now/recently clearly stated/particular investments in products with 
 brand names in order to meet the clearly stated/particular demands in the many special places/good jobs of the market. 
 Second, the growth of internal useful things/valuable supplies of (money-related) money of MCs is smaller than the growth 
 of the markets they are in (Van Dijk and Poppe, 1992). 
 This article addresses the organizational and (money-related) effects/results/suggestions of these changes 
 from a transaction costs (way of seeing things / sensible view of what is and is not important). Two valuable things are involved in the test of the MC as 
 an (producing a lot with very little waste) organizational form. First, the investments made at the farm. A farmer has to 
 invest in (clearly stated/particular) valuable things (related to/looking at/thinking about) land ((material that makes plants grow better)), labor (effort) and capital (equipment) in 
 order to increase the chance of a good harvest. Second, the processing of the harvest into 
 final products at the downstream/processing stage of production may also require specific 
 investments in bringing the produce to value. 
 An farming-based or (plant-related) chain of production faces two hold-up problems. First, the 
 (likelihood to go bad in a short time) of the harvest puts the (compared to other things) small farmer in a weak (related to arriving at an agreement) position 
 when a price has to be (worked to reach agreement/got through) with the (compared to other things) large company processing the harvest. 
 The fear of the farmer is that there will be hold-up in the (back-and-forth conversation to agree on something) process. Opposing 
 power is needed to eliminate this fear and is created by downstream/forward integration of 
 many small private businesspersons into a MC. Each member of a MC owns and therefore 
 decides upon valuable things at two stages of production. The farmer makes his own investment 
 decisions and owns the resulting valuable things at his farm (the upstream stage). The ownership of 
 the valuable things which are used to process the produce of farmers at the downstream stage is in 
 the hands of all the members of the MC together. The hold-up problem faced by farmers 
 has been the driving force behind the coming into view of the MC as an organizational form in the 
 past. 
 Second, the outside rich money-giver of the business/project processing the produce of the farmer 
 fears hold-up when it does not have control over how the money which are made available 
 will be invested by the management of this business/project. The corporation or (person or business who gives money to help start a business)-owned 
 firm in which shareholders are the owner of the business/project resolves this hold-up problem. 
 The portion of control over investment decisions to shareholders gives them confidence 
 that their money will be spent well. We will refer to a corporation or an (person or business who gives money to help start a business) owned firm 
 as a ordinary firm (CF). 
 The claim of this article is that a MC is not an (producing a lot with very little waste) organizational form when final 
 product markets demand (made different) products, needing/ordering big money for specific 
 investments at the processing/downstream stage of production. The reason is that farmers 
 have to decide about investments at the upstream as well as the downstream stage of 
 production when they are organized in a MC. They choose individually the farm investments 
 and together the non-farm or MC investments. There is a habit/desire that the best 
 investment decision with respect to bringing the produce to value at the downstream stage 
 will not be chosen by a MC, because farmers take investment decisions in the MC which 
 bring farm output and MC output both/together to highest value. Control over valuable things is in a CF 
 assigned to the party whose investment matters most to the value of the relationship in a 
 situation with a high level of valuable thing level of detail, whereas it is not in a MC. 
 
 3 
 
 Section two reviews transaction costs money flow/money-based studies with respect to organizational and 
 (money-related) control and provides a definition of a CF and a MC which is compatible with 
 this approach. Section three plans the guesses of the paper. Section four ends/decides 
 and points to/shows topics for future research.

 Transaction costs money flow/money-based studies 
 
 Starting point of transaction costs money flow/money-based studies is the (instance of watching, noticing, or making a statement) that the complex difficulty of 
 the real world makes it too expensive to describe all (connected/related) (events that are dependent on other things that might or might not happen) (related to/looking at/thinking about) the 
 exchange ex ante in a contract. Contracts are therefore necessarily incomplete. Williamson 
 (1985) argues that this causes problems. It causes problems when the parties involved in the exchange make specific, permanent (or sunk) investments, (in other words) investments which have a 
 significant higher value within the relationship than in other choice uses.2 This puts the (person or business who gives money to help start a business) 
 in a weak (related to arriving at an agreement) position (related to/looking at/thinking about) the division of the ex post extra, because the 
 incompleteness of contracts prevents that all possibilities are covered ex ante. The (person or business who gives money to help start a business) 
 expects that the other party may take advantage of the incompleteness, (in other words) behave 
 (whenever possible) by claiming a larger share of the ex post extra than at first agreed upon, 
 and decides not to invest in the highest extra creating project. This is the (inefficient) 
 hold-up problem (Klein, et al., 1978). 
 A good choice of control structure lessens or even eliminates the hold-up 
 problem. Control structures are told apart by the portion of decision authority and 
 the identity of the leftover/extra claimant. MCs and CFs are carefully thought about/believed as two clear/separate 
 control structures. The most important distinguishing feature of a MC is the rule of control 
 by the input suppliers, (in other words) the farmers. They are both suppliers of raw materials and 
 providers of capital of the MC. Outside shareholders are the leftover/extra claimants in a CF and 
 usually do not supply inputs to the processor. MCs and CFs are expected to react 
 differently to their surrounding conditions due to the different assignment of control in unforeseen 
 (events that are dependent on other things that might or might not happen). 
 Subsections 2.1 and 2.2 address how the different organizational and (money-related) control 
 structures deal with the hold-up problem. The analysis is (serving to compare two or more things) in nature in the sense 
 that relative differences between different organizational forms (or different (money-related) 
 instruments) are the focus of analysis. Guesses are created in terms of 'discrete 
 (related to what holds something together and makes it strong) other choices" (Williamson, 1991)3.

 This article employs the valuable thing level of detail branch of transaction costs money flow/money-based studies. There is big 
 scientific support for this (detailed description of exactly what is required) (Williamson, 1985). Barzel (1982) fights for a focus on 
 measurement problems instead of valuable thing level of detail, which receives scientific support in Anderson and 
 Schmittlein (1984). Evidence has to tell whether an valuable thing level of detail (detailed description of exactly what is required) or a 
 measurement problems (detailed description of exactly what is required) as (coming from the outside of something) (numbers that change/things that change) is most good in explaining control 
 structure changes in farming-based and (plant-related) markets.

 The curves of the different control structures which will be shown and are to be understood/explained as a 
 "reduced form" of an hidden (under) model (Williamson, 1991). The reduced form is to be seen as a way to 
 deal with the early stage of development of the explanation of the firm (HolmstrÃ¶m and Roberts, 1998). The 
 incomplete contract books (Grossman and Hart (1986) and Hart and Moore (1990)) provides a 
 planned treatment of the costs and benefits of different organizational control structures, which 
 is extended to different (money-related) control structures by Aghion and Bolton (1992). The starting point

 2.1 
 
 Organizational control 
 
 Transaction costs money flow/money-based studies argues that ownership structure can be best understood 
 in terms of the control rights that it gives/discusses. The main point of transaction costs money flow/money-based studies is 
 that ex post (arriving at an agreed price or set of terms for an exchange) positions will depend on the organizational big picture, (in other words) control 
 structure. Market control is (fought for/pleaded for) when the degree of valuable thing level of detail is low, 
 because it prevents the slow-working costs of exchange within a firm. However, exchange in 
 markets becomes filled with problems when the level of valuable thing level of detail is increasing due to the 
 increasing importance of the hold-up problem. Up-and-down (combination of different things together that work as one unit) gains in attractiveness 
 because it reduces ex post (grabs at any easy opportunity) behavior (related to/looking at/thinking about) the contract terms by one's 
 trading partner by the method of selective helping action. Figure 1 summarizes these 
 results. The level of valuable thing level of detail k is on the flat/left-and-right axis and the costs of organizational 
 control on the up-and-down axis. The costs of three control structures as a function of the 
 level of valuable thing level of detail are shown. M(k) represents the costs of market control, H(k) 
 are the control costs of a organization (i.e. up-and-down (combination of different things together that work as one unit) or exchange within a firm) 
 and X(k) represents the costs of some combination organization, like a franchise or a joint 
 trip/business. Transaction costs money flow/money-based studies presents/asks/stands in a showy and fake way that the (transaction) costs (making small) 
 control structure is chosen. The figure hints that for projects with low levels of valuable thing 
 level of detail exchange via markets is (described the future). A combination organization is chosen as the mode 
 of exchange for (between beginner and expert) levels of valuable thing level of detail. Finally, the control structure 
 organization is (described the future) for high levels of valuable thing level of detail.

 Figure 1: Organizational form and valuable thing level of detail (Williamson, 1991) 
 of this books is the idea (you think is true) of (grabbing at any easy opportunity). Institutional money flow/money-based studies (Hodgson, 1998) focusses 
 on the control effects/results/suggestions of the idea (you think is true) of bounded clear thinking.

 2.2 
 
 (money-related) control 
 
 Williamson (1988) approaches the choice of (money-related) legal documents from the same 
 (way of seeing things / sensible view of what is and is not important) as the choice of organizational form. (money owed)  and equity are besides (money-related) 
 instruments also control (tools or objects used to do work or measure something) in transaction costs money flow/money-based studies. Each (money-related) 
 instrument specifies certain control rights and how returns depend on results. (money owed)  is 
 seen as stiff contract rules, like interest payments at fixed periods of time (or space) in time, liquidity 
 tests, pay back needed thing at the end of the term, and the bank has claim priority in the 
 (related to one thing depending on another thing that might or might not happen) of (not having enough money to pay bills). The stiffness of the rules controlling/ruling (money owed)  means that they apply to 
 all possible (events that are dependent on other things that might or might not happen). The attractiveness of this stiffness is that only a few standard 
 contract rules are carefully thought about/believed, which hints that the start-up costs of the design of a (money owed) 
 contract are low. The disadvantage of having only a few simple rules is that they are often 
 not well custom-designed to a particular unforeseen (related to one thing depending on another thing that might or might not happen). Their stiffness prevents that (producing a lot with very little waste) 
 (change to make better/related to changing something) can not always be made ex post, (in other words) (money owed)  involves maldaptations to facts or conditions (that surround someone) 
 which are not imagined in the design of the contract ex ante. This is especially filled with problems 
 when the hold-up problem stands near and threatens, (in other words) a situation in which (producing a lot with very little waste) investment involves a high 
 level of valuable thing level of detail. The hint/result/effect (of the inability of a few simple rules to respond to 
 all possible (events that are dependent on other things that might or might not happen) (in a way that produces a lot with very little waste)) is that the costs of (money owed)  rises sharply when the level of 
 valuable thing level of detail increases. 
 Equity is a control structure in which rich money-givers are given rights of control. Outside 
 equity assigns rich money-givers the role of leftover/extra claimants in good as well as bad times, there is 
 no pay back date and a board of directors with long/big power to control the management 
 is selected. The variety and flexibility of the control (machines/methods/ways) available to the board 
 (e.g. power to replace management, access to internal performance measures, allow 
 audits for special follow-up purposes, inform important investment and operating proposals 
 before they are used), allows it to (change to make better/change to fit new conditions) decisions (producing more with less waste)ly to a variety of 
 facts or conditions (that surround someone) than the stiff (money-related) control instrument (money owed). This board gives rich money-givers 
 confidence that their useful things/valuable supplies will be used in their interests and will therefore result in lower 
 costs of capital than (money owed)  as it wasations with a high level of valuable thing level of detail. Equity is more 
 complex than (money owed)  because a variety of control (machines/methods/ways) has to be developed. The 
 startup costs of equity are therefore higher than those of (money owed). The costs of (money owed)  as well as 
 equity show a positive relationship with the level of valuable thing level of detail, but the costs of (money owed) 
 increase faster than the cost of equity, (in other words) the attractiveness of outside equity increases 
 compared to (money owed)  when the level of valuable thing level of detail increases. The stiff character of rules 
 connected with (money owed)  is responsible for this feature. 
 Only two (money-related) legal documents have been distinguished: (money owed)  and equity. There are 
 also combined forms, which have (features/ qualities/ traits) of both (money owed)  and equity, e.g. warrants and 
 convertible (written promises to pay money back from a loan). The costs of these (maturing within 3-10 years) (money-related) control structures are also a 
 function of the degree of valuable thing level of detail (Williamson, 1988). Figure 2 summarizes the 
 above graphically, where D(k) (Y(k), E(k)) is the costs of (money owed) (combination finance, equity) as a 
 function of the level of valuable thing level of detail. The (statement about the future) is that (money owed)  will be used for projects 
 with a low level of valuable thing level of detail (k&amp;lt;k3), whereas equity will be used when the degree of 
 valuable thing level of detail is high (k&amp;gt;k4). Combination (money-related) control structures, Williamson labels 
 them dequity, are expected for (between beginner and expert) levels of valuable thing level of detail (k3&amp;lt;k&amp;lt;k4).

 MC against/compared to/or CF 
 
 This section identifies the organizational and (money-related) control differences between 
 a CF and a MC. The organizational control differences (related to/looking at/thinking about) control and 
 democratic decision making (3.1) and the (money-related) control differences (3.2) are related 
 to the level of valuable thing level of detail of the investment at the processing stage of production. These 
 subsections are put together (3.3) in order to state the main guess in terms of the 
 second hold-up problem. It will be argued that this guess continues to hold when the 
 first hold-up problem is also taken into account. 
 
 3.1 
 
 Organizational control differences 
 
 Internal as well as external control systems serve a role in controlling/punishing decision making 
 in an organization. A MC seems to be a control structure which has a well functioning 
 internal control system. First, input suppliers have a large personal (money-related) stake in the 
 downstream firm. This provides a believable signal that they will do their job of (watching and checking by law officers) 
 internal decision making well. Second, the lack of the market for (related to big business) control improves 
 the (rewards or reasons for doing something) for members in a MC to create a well functioning internal control system 
 even further.4 Shares of a MC are not traded in the stock market. Members therefore face 
 
 4 
 
 However, these attractive features of a MC don't suggest that a MC necessarily functions better than a 
 CF, because its shares are not traded in the stock market. A CF with a listing on the stock market has 
 commited itself to report regularly and according to certain standards about its situation. Another 
 attractive feature of the publicly traded CF is that added/more external money can be gotten by issuing 
 
 7 
 
 (problems, delays, etc.) in trading their (money-related) stakes. Stockholders can easily get out of a CF by selling 
 their stock in the market. Members of a MC can not and therefore pay more attention to the 
 way the MC is being run. Finally, a almost the same  (reward or reason for doing something) is given by the lack of a market for 
 inputs. The (not being there; not being present) of a market for inputs eliminates for a MC the possibility of comparing 
 its own performance with those of rivals. It becomes therefore more attractive to put forward 
 effort in the internal control system in order to make up for the (not being there; not being present) of the yardstick 
 of the market. The lack of the market for (related to big business) control and the lack of a market for 
 inputs provides (rewards or reasons for doing something) to participate in the internal control system. 
 Democratic decision making in a MC meets some (problems, delays, etc.). First, the process 
 of opinion- and decisionmaking (related to/looking at/thinking about) important policy shifts is more time using/eating 
 than in other organizational forms. This reduces flexibility and creates (slow or no movement/the force of something moving) with respect to 
 the reaction to changing market facts or conditions (that surround someone). This problem seems to be increasing when 
 markets become more complex. 5 Second, an increase in the degree of valuable thing level of detail (k) 
 worsens the disadvantages a MC has to face. Investments with a higher k involve less 
 involvement of the members, because they don't have the detailed knowledge to form an opinion 
 and give their fiat. Higher outlays are therefore needed/demanded for a well functioning democratic 
 process of decision making and the preservation of the "organized trust". The process of 
 decisionmaking will also take more time because the degree of complex difficulty probably 
 increases with a higher level of valuable thing level of detail, especially in a globalizing (process of people making, selling, and buying things). Third, if 
 k increases without a direct relation with the original activities of the MC (and by that/in that way with 
 the basic activities of the members), members seem to be less informed (related to/looking at/thinking about) the 
 corresponding value and risks than shareholders of a CF. This causes reluctancy among 
 members to accept that a large part of the extra will be kept as kept/held earnings, unless 
 an acceptable rate of a money-making state on other investments (including their own farm) will be 
 (understood/made real/achieved). Fourth, returns during the membership period have to be at least as high as returns 
 in other places. This limited appropriability problem needs/demands that the internal rate of return on the 
 valuable things of MCs must be higher than that of CFs if internally financed investment is to be 
 chosen when the middle-point membership length of time is shorter than the project's recovering (a money-based loss) 
 period (Bonin, e.a. 1993). MCs using mainly internal money to finance capital will therefore 
 underinvest relative to similar CFs when a member's individual claim to the returns is 
 non-move (from one place to another)able. The problem is getting worse due to bad changes in the (related to information about people) 
 composition of the member population, which will be reflected in the result of the 
 democratic decision making process (Hart and Moore, 1994). The average age of the 
 members is increasing due to (lowering in number/getting worse) entry of new, young members. 
 However, there are at least five forces pointing in another direction. First, democrating 
 decision making is likely to create a merging of opinions along the lines of the Blackwell 
 and Dubins' (1962) result. Second, democratic decision making is less able to be hurt by 
 successful politicking because bad proposals are separated out (Tullock, 1992). Third, 
 democratic decision making may be second-best when the preferences of the important person (who votes) 
 are close to those of the average person (who votes) (Hart and Moore, 1994). Fourth, the costs of the 
 more awkward decision making process in a MC may be made up for/paid for by improved 
 decision making (Hendrikse, 1998). Finally, the huge (money-related) involvement of the rich money-givers 
 new shares, whereas a MC often has to go thru awkward (back-and-forth conversations to agree on something) with the providers of external 
 money. 
 5 
 An advantage of a slow, democratic process with conservative people (who vote) may be that the approval of a 
 policy decision will be carried out fast and with a lot of support. 
 
 8 
 
 in the success of the cooperative is in general a strong loyalty to/promise to get big 
 information in order to test policy decisions. 
 A MC and a CF are two different control structures. They are both an example 
 of hierarchial control in terms of figure 1, because there is one party having the leftover/extra 
 control rights in all possible unforeseen facts or conditions (that surround someone).6 Figure 2 summarizes the above 
 account of the differences between MCs and CFs with the level of valuable thing level of detail at the 
 processing stage of production on the flat/left-and-right axis.. A organization is a cost (making small) 
 control structure in figure 1 when the degree of valuable thing level of detail of investments is higher 
 than k2. MCs and CFs are examples of organizations and have therefore to be analysed in this 
 domain. The H(k)-curve of a MC is below (above) the H(k)-curve of a CF when the 
 advantages of a MC outweigh (are smaller than) the disadvantages. The (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) in this section suggest that the H(k)-curve of a MC is steeper than an H(k)-curve of a CF, (in other words) the 
 intense watching by the farmers of investment decisions is an attractive feature of a MC, 
 but it decreases in effectiveness when the level of detail of investments is increasing.

 Figure 3 reflects a situation in which a MC may be an (producing a lot with very little waste) control structure. 
 The end/end result is that MCs may be a doable/possible organizational form for (between beginner and expert) levels of 
 valuable thing level of detail, (in other words) k2 &amp;lt; k &amp;lt; k5. (A MC will not come out  or disappear when the costs of its 
 control structure are higher than those of a CF for every value of k higher than k2, (in other words) k2 
 &amp;gt; k5.). Figure 3 also points to/shows that the members of MC have some (freedom/extra time/extra space) to advance their 
 interests as input suppliers when k2 &amp;lt; k5. The superior functioning internal control system of 
 the MC allows either the input suppliers to advance an input price which is above the market 
 price, or not to provide the (producing a lot with very little waste) level of attention in the internal control system, or slack, 
 or increase the (money-related) reserves of the MC. However, the extent to which these activities 
 are allowed by the market depends on the level of valuable thing level of detail.

 Two other examples of hierarchial control are a buying cooperative and a labor managed firm. 
 A buying cooperative is a control structure where a particular group of customers is the leftover/extra 
 claimant. Workers have decision authority in unforeseen (events that are dependent on other things that might or might not happen) in a labor managed firm.

 3.2 
 
 (money-related) control differences 
 
 The composition of the (money-related) structure is influenced in two ways by the choice of 
 control. First, a MC receives better terms on (money owed)  than a CF. There are a few reasons 
 why k3 in figure 2 of a MC will be higher than the k3 of a CF. First, each farmer will have a 
 big share of his crop processed by a particular MC. They have therefore a large 
 (money-related) stake in the MC. Second, (money-related) money is created internally in a MC by 
 kept/held earnings. Farmers decide about the input price the cooperative is paying. They may 
 decide that this price is lower than the market price in order to add the difference to the 
 kept/held earnings. This gives providers of (money owed)  the confidence that the terms of the contract 
 will be met. It turns out that they provide (money owed)  without any (something you owe/something you're responsible for/disadvantage) of the farmers when they 
 have created a high level of inside equity. Third, equity shares of a CF can at every instant 
 of time be traded in the stock market, (in other words) they are move (from one place to another)able. Members of a MC often do 
 not have individual and move (from one place to another)able ownership rights in the valuable things of the MC. This "money in 
 the dead hand" provides a commitment that the (money owed)  contract will be honored. Fourth, the 
 previous section has created different reasons why a MC may have a superior internal 
 control system. These features of a MC suggest that the D(k)-curve of a MC will be below 
 the D(k)-curve of a CF. 
 Second, outside equity is more expensive for a MC than a CF, because the feature 
 that farmers are by definition the leftover/extra claimants in a MC prevents that the providers of 
 these money have much to say about how their money is spent. Member control hints that 
 farmers choose the investments of a MC. This is filled with problems (related to/looking at/thinking about) the terms at which 
 outside equity is made available for specific (downstream) investments, because members 
 select investment projects which bring farm output and MC output both/together to highest value. 
 Outside providers of equity have to fear that their money in a MC are not put to best use 
 in terms of return on investment. They will reflect this in asking a higher cost for giving-up 
 control. A CF does not face this problem because providers of equity decide themselves 
 how their money will be spend in order to add value to the harvest. One of the pretty/interesting facts 
 of a MC is that a big amount of inside equity is given by keeping a (large/relatively large) 
 share of the (money made/good things received) as kept/held earnings each year. This is often seen as a major advantage 
 of the MC, because it provides an inexpensive source of money. However, it also has a 
 disadvantage in the sense that it is a control structure which is more "forgiving" than 
 (money owed) (Williamson, 1988). Inside equity provides weaker (rewards or reasons for doing something) than (money owed)  to perform 
 well. These (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) suggest that the E(k)-curve of a MC will be above the E(k)-curve of 
 a CF. The value of k4 in figure 2 will therefore be higher for a MC than for a CF. This 
 hints that there are values of k for which a CF will use outside equity, whereas it is 
 (producing a lot with very little waste) for a MC to use other (money-related) legal documents. The nature of these other (money-related) 
 instruments depends on the value of k compared to k3. (money owed)  will be used when k a¤ k3, 
 whereas a combined form of finance will be used when k &amp;gt; k3. 
 Figure 4 summarizes the above (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) by extending figure 2. The cost 
 (making small) (money-related) control structure is drawn for a MC as well as a CF as a function of 
 the level of valuable thing level of detail at the processing stage of production.7 
 
 7 
 
 It is assumed that the Y(k)-curve is the same for both control structures. This is done in order to 
 prevent that the analysis becomes for no good reason complex. We are only claiming that there are combination 
 forms of finance. This is not enough in order to plan a statement about a difference between an

 Ymc (k)-curve and an Ycf (k)-curve. However, our main claim holds (anyway/in any event) the creation of such a 
 statement because the (stopping or interfering with something) and slope of a combined form of finance is in between the (money owed)  and equity 
 curve. It is therefore assumed for convenience that Ymc (k) = Ycf (k). Our main claim will hold even when 
 combined forms of finance are left out of the analysis completely. Combined forms are anyway included in 
 order to stay in line with Williamson (1988). 
 
 11 
 
 The relationship between the choice of an (producing a lot with very little waste) control structure, 
 organizational as well as (money-related), and the level of valuable thing level of detail of a MC as well as a CF 
 has been established. Businesses/projects have to be tested on all dimensions both/together in order to 
 plan guesses about their performance. This may give rise to many different 
 grouping issues. However, this problem is avoided here because the organizational 
 and (money-related) choice of control point in the same direction when the level of valuable thing 
 level of detail increases. If the level of valuable thing level of detail increases, then the CF does not lose in 
 attractiveness. Figure 3 illustrates this (related to/looking at/thinking about) organizational control and figure 4 
 shows this with respect to (money-related) control. The main guess which is suggested by 
 these (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) is that an business/project will not switch from a MC to a CF when the level of 
 valuable thing level of detail is increasing, (in other words) a MC reduces in attractiveness compared to a CF when 
 the (producing a lot with very little waste) level of valuable thing level of detail (of investments at the processing stage of production) is 
 increasing. 
 The above has also effects/results/suggestions for the ability to be done of the MC in different countries. 
 Important (money-related) control differences (related to/looking at/thinking about) equity between the USA and the 
 Netherlands are the limited rights of shareholders and the virtual non-existence of the market 
 for (related to big business) control (due to the long/big use of anti-takeover measures) in the Dutch 
 setting (Boot, 1994). The providers of equity are the owners of the CF in the USA, whereas 
 all kinds of restrictions are forced by the Dutch law on the rights of outside rich money-givers. 
 Outside equity holders in the Netherlands receive a standard dividend, whereas the 
 remaining part of (money made/good things received) may go to workers and slack. Equity does hardly carry any 
 control rights for the shareholders and therefore doesn't differ much from (money owed). This hints 
 that the value of k4 is larger in the Netherlands than in the USA, because the E(k)-curve is 
 almost the same as the D(k)-curve in the former country.8 
 There are three important organizational control differences between CFs and 
 MCs (related to/looking at/thinking about) the Board of Directors in the Netherlands. MCs don't move (from one place to another) the final/best 
 approval of the once-a-year account to the Board of Directors. Secondly, they also don't leave 
 the right of (assigning to a position) members of the Board of Directors to the Board of Directors itself.9 
 The General Assembly takes care of these tasks. Finally, the Dutch law on cooperatives 
 secures member control because it allows that up to two thirds of the members of the Board 
 of Directors are selected by the General Assembly of a MC.10 (The workers group of people has 
 (power to block a law from being enacted) (related to/looking at/thinking about) the composition of the final third.) These institutional differences make 
 8 
 
 This is relected in the evidence. Stock price/earnings ratios in Amsterdam are by far the 
 lowest in Europe (Bennis and Van Leeuwen, 1992). New stock is issued at 24 times the once-a-year (money made/good things received) in 
 the United States of America, whereas it is only 12 times the once-a-year (money made/good things received) in the Netherlands. These 
 institutional features suggest that Dutch firms have on average a higher debt/equity ratio than 
 American firms, which is supported by Remonola (1990). 
 9 
 A board of directors in large CF in the Dutch setting is an in-group which selects its own followers 
 (way of thinking/basic truth/rule of cooptation). Shareholders can only by majority vote not accept a candidate. They have no 
 active rights to (assign to a position) one or, in many cases, even to propose one. 
 10 
 There are also differences between Anglo-Saxon (e.g. American) and Germanic (e.g. Dutch) board of 
 directors (Moerland, 1995). Anglo-Saxon Boards of Directors have a one-level  system, in which executive 
 managers and outside experts are represented. Boards of Directors in Germanic countries have a two-level 
 board system, consisting of an executive board and a supervisory board. (The law specifies certain 
 needed things (related to/looking at/thinking about) employee representatives in the supervisory board). Insiders and outsiders have 
 been separated in a two-level  system. However, the way of thinking/basic truth/rule of cooptation in the executive board in The 
 Netherlands seems to offset the advantages of the two-level  system (related to/looking at/thinking about) the effectiveness of the 
 executive board (Boot, 1994). 
 
 12 
 
 it more likely that k5 is larger in the Netherlands than in the USA. The virtual (not being there; not being present) of the 
 market for (related to big business) control is worse for CFs than MCs in the Netherlands, because the 
 member control feature of MCs doesn't allow much influence of this (related to control or punishment) (machine/method/way) 
 anyway. This reinforces the guess that value of k5 will be higher in the Netherlands. 
 The guess which follows from these (serving to compare two or more things) statics (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) is that MCs 
 are (described the future) to be doable/possible for a larger range of the level of valuable thing level of detail in the 
 Netherlands than in the USA. The (money-related) control difference, (in other words) a higher value of k4 in 
 the Netherlands than in the USA, hints that the disadvantages of outside equity finance of 
 a MC compared to a CF come out  at a higher level of valuable thing level of detail in the Netherlands than 
 in the USA. The organizational control difference, (in other words) a higher level of k5 in the 
 Netherlands than in the USA, hints that it is more likely that there is a range of levels of 
 valuable thing level of detail higher than k2 in which a MC is (producing more with less waste) than a CF, (in other words) the attractive 
 organizational control of a MC more than offsets the (money-related) control 
 disadvantages. 
 This section has focussed on the investment problems (related to/looking at/thinking about) the processor. There 
 is also the hold-up problem (related to/looking at/thinking about) the farm investments. However, the results of our 
 analysis do not change when this hold-up problem is included in the analysis. Our claims 
 (related to/looking at/thinking about) the level of valuable thing level of detail of the investments at the processor are created 
 relative to the hold-up problem (related to/looking at/thinking about) farm investments. So, a statement in this 
 subsection like the (producing a lot with very little waste) level of valuable thing level of detail has increased can be understood/explained as the 
 (producing a lot with very little waste) level of valuable thing level of detail of the investments at the processor has increased relative to 
 the (producing a lot with very little waste) level of valuable thing level of detail of the farm. Grossman and Hart (1986) have analysed a 
 situation with two hold-up problems. Figure 5 presents the balance investment levels for 
 different control structures. Point MC reflects the investment levels when a MC is 
 chosen. The level of valuable thing level of detail of farm investments is high, but the level of valuable thing 
 level of detail of investments at the processor is low. The reverse holds in point CF where a CF 
 is chosen. The main result of the Grossman and Hart analysis (1986, p. 708) is that "Firm 1 
 control will be desirable when firm 1's ex ante investment is much more important than firm 
 2's (so that firm 2's underinvestment under firm 1 control is (compared to other things) unimportant) and when 
 overinvestment by firm 1 under firm 1 control is a less bad problem than underinvestment 
 by firm 1' and a²nonintegration is desirable if the two investments are both important in some 
 sense, so that it is better than have both of them at a medium level than to have one very 
 high and the other very low as under integration'. The claim of this article is that 
 facts or conditions (that surround someone) have changed such that the (producing a lot with very little waste) level of valuable thing level of detail of investments at 
 the processor has increased relative to the (producing a lot with very little waste) level of valuable thing level of detail of investments at 
 the farm.11 12 This hints that (wasting very little while working or producing something) of control structure choice needs/demands a change 
 from a MC to CF. 
 
 11 
 
 American Crystal Sugar seems to be an example of where a CF was converted to a MC. Red River 
 Valley Sugar Red vegetable  Growers Association got the CF American Crystal Sugar in 1973. Volkin and 
 Bradford (1975) write that a²What grower association leaders really feared was the possibility that 
 American Crystal would close one or more of its four plants in Minnesota and North Dakota. This 
 concern was supported by watchings that a²factory upkeep was not being maintained for most 
 (producing a lot with very little waste) operations' and a²Steps had to be taken to protect growers' long-term sugar red vegetable  production 
 patterns, which had meant so much to their job'. The change at American Crystal Sugar does not 
 interfere with our explanation because it provides an example of increasing importance of the first hold-up 
 problem, without making any references to the final product market. If the first hold-up problem becomes

 End/end result and further research 
 
 This article has (examined closely) some parts of the MC from a transaction costs 
 money flow/money-based studies (way of seeing things / sensible view of what is and is not important). A MC and a CF are both thought about/believed as a hierarchial control 
 structure. The main difference between these control structures is that the input suppliers 
 have the formal authority (related to/looking at/thinking about) investment decisions in a MC, whereas outside equity 
 holders have this right in a CF. 
 A control structure has to face/deal with two hold-up problems in an farming-based or 
 (plant-related) chain of production. First, it has to prevent after-harvest hold-ups of (likely to go bad in a short time) 
 farm products. Second, it has to get attractive terms on outside money for its investments. 
 The opposing power feature of a MC resolves the first problem. The second problem is 
 not material when the investments of a MC are not specific, which is the case in markets 
 seen as (group of things that are all pretty much the same) products. However, a MC is not able to resolve both 
 problems in (made different) product markets, which require investments with a high level of 
 valuable thing level of detail at the processing stage of production, e.g. brand names. The attractiveness 
 of a MC decreases with respect to choosing (producing a lot with very little waste) investment levels because democratic 
 decision making becomes more filled with problems and members will also take (things to carefully think about) 
 (related to/looking at/thinking about) return on farm investments into account when this decision is made. This is also 
 filled with problems from a (money-related) control (way of seeing things / sensible view of what is and is not important), because the terms at which (money-related) 
 money is made available by outsiders are worse than those faced by a CF when the level of 
 valuable thing level of detail is high. The needed thing of rule of control by the member of a MC is 
 responsible for this disadvantage. It reinforces the claim about the ability to be done of the MC as a 
 more important and the second does not, then our explanation (describes the future) that switches from a CF to an MC are 
 to be expected. 
 12 
 A referee pointed to/showed that the (likelihood to go bad in a short time) of crops is now/recently not as much a problem anymore due to 
 (related to computers and science) developments. This (instance of watching, noticing, or making a statement) strengthens our claim, because it hints that the first 
 hold-up problem has reduced in importance compared to the second hold-up.

 function of the level of valuable thing level of detail. The (agreement that ends an argument) of the second problem needs/demands a 
 switch from a MC to a CF. These arguments result in the main guess of the paper that 
 an increase in the extent of valuable thing level of detail will never be with a switch from a 
 CF to a MC. 
 An important topic for future research is to (ask lots of questions about/try to find the truth about) the possibilities (related to/looking at/thinking about) the 
 design of an organizational structure and (money-related) legal documents which on the one hand 
 maintain the special MC character and on the other hand eliminate the inefficiencies 
 connected with this organizational form. Most solutions which are now/recently thought about/believed 
 within the MC structure consist of some (using different things) in the (money-related) terms being offered to 
 members. Examples are preference shares and (atomic) discounts. They take account of the 
 variety between the members. However, this does not solve the second hold-up problem. 
 A MC has to solve two hold-up problems, which is asking too much. An added degree 
 of freedom has to be created. The introduction of other organizational arrangements 
 (association, participation company) may resolve the lack of opposing power when the 
 MC is forgotten.
