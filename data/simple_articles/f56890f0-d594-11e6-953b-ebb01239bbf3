 Abstract 
 (even though there is the existence of) the wider application of (wasting very little while working or producing something) analysis in Indian farming, little has been done on the (act of asking questions and trying to find the truth about something) of intra and 
 interecological differences/different versions, size differences and their interactions. However, (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) issues have most important effects/results/suggestions for the low-input 
 (able to last/helping the planet) farming-based production. What's more, due to the different causes of (wasting very little while working or producing something), the old size-based debate on (wasting very little while working or producing something) 
 differences is not yet resolved. The present study examines the level of technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) across (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) zones and farm size groups in 
 paddy farms of the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu. The study showed that 90% of the difference/different version in output among paddy (IR-20) farms 
 ' in the state is due to differences in technical (wasting very little while working or producing something). Land, animal power and fertilisers have big influence on the level of paddy 
 production. Changing/different from 0.59 to 0.97, the mean technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) was found to be 0.83. The use of F-test in two-way analysis of 
 variance (ANOV A) and changed moving backward (Tobit model), with dummies for (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) zones, farm size groups and their interactions, has 
 shown that, at mean level, the level of technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) among paddy farms of the state differs significantly across agro-(related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) zones 
 and size groups also. The study further pointed to/showed that small-sized paddy farms in zone II and medium-sized paddy farms in zone III are 
 represented by (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth)ly size-(created unfair thinking in)/(unfair-thinking) production ways of doing things; this way (accomplishing or gaining) higher technical (wasting very little while working or producing something).

 1. Introduction 
 
 The measurement of (wasting very little while working or producing something) (technical, allocative and money-based) has remained an area of important research both in the developed and developing 
 countries. Especially in developing farming-based 
 (processes of people making, selling, and buying things), where useful things/valuable supplies are poor/not enough and opportunities for developing and putting into use better technologies are reducing, (Ali and Chaudhry, 1990) (wasting very little while working or producing something) measurement is very important because it is a 
 factor for working well growth. Such studies help

 benefit these (processes of people making, selling, and buying things) by deciding/figuring out the extent to 
 which it is possible to raise working well by improving the neglected source, (in other words), (wasting very little while working or producing something), with the 
 existing useful thing/valuable supply base and the available technology. 
 Hence, by doing so, they could also help decide 
 whether to improve (wasting very little while working or producing something) first or develop a new 
 technology in the short run. 
 Having to do with the long-lasting view in literature that 
 farmers practising traditional farming are 'poor 
 but (producing a lot with very little waste)', and the resulting focus on increased investments in creating new and more 
 productive ways of doing things, a few studies that (examined closely) the relationship between farm size and output 
 in Indian farming have been managed and did/done since the 
 late 1950s. (related to a large area) differences/different versions, together with

 input-output relations and businesses/projects, have also been 
 taken into account since the 1960s. These include the 
 works of Saini (1969), Sahota (1968), Hopper (1965). 
 These studies were managed and did/done to test, recommend and plan appropriate productive ways of doing things that lead to improved useful thing/valuable supply-use (wasting very little while working or producing something). 
 However, as they represented the production process 
 of the sample farms on an input-output space (production function) with a given technology, they were 
 not able to separate causes of (wasting very little while working or producing something) due the 
 (related to the body function of living things) nature of farming-based production from the 
 farm-clearly stated/particular differences in the use of the available 
 technology. 
 Later, (even though there is the existence of) the idea-based (problems, delays, etc.) and (related to careful studying or deep thinking) differences, (wasting very little while working or producing something) measurements have 
 been attempted in Indian farming since the 1970s 
 (see for example, Huang and Bagi (1984), Kalirajan 
 (1981), Junankar (1980), Sidhu (1974), and Lau and 
 Yotopoulos (1971); in fact, the last thing just mentioned two measured 
 relative technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) using shadow profit 
 function). With particular reference to rice farming, 
 the studies by Shanmugam and Palanisami (1993) in 
 Tamil Nadu, Datt and Joshi (1992) in Uttar Pradesh, 
 and Jayaram et al. (1987) in Karnataka are among 
 the well-known/obvious works. These studies, although framed 
 on pre-decided or (related to the study of how likely or unlikely things are to happen) guesses of the 
 edge of something/unexplored area production function, reported a mean technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) of 75%, 66% and 74% among paddy 
 farms in the (pertaining to each person or thing) states. 
 On the other hand, although we watch/notice wider 
 applications of (wasting very little while working or producing something) measures in paddy farms 
 of India, only very few of these studies have (examined closely) the same across size groups and agro-(related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) areas (zones) (at the same time). Besides, there is 
 no agreement among the available studies on the 
 old debate of (wasting very little while working or producing something) differences in the smallvs. large-sized farms. The earlier idea was that, 
 under the usual labour intensive technology, 
 output per hectare on large farms was lower mainly 
 because of higher cost of hired labour. Anyway, 
 with the progressive introduction of technology, new 
 production possibilities have been opened for large 
 farms (Singh, 1992). Therefore, with their better 
 capital position, as well as institutional, extension 
 and credit advantages, large farmers can 
 substitute manpower by labour-saving devices; this way, 
 they are (producing more with less waste) than small farms. Available 
 (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) hints that different factors cause differ- 
 
 ences in (wasting very little while working or producing something) even among farms of almost the same  size 
 and other factors of production. The debate will 
 further be heated when (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) ((related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth)) 
 issues are incorporated. This is an important issue of 
 the present time, because (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) issues are the 
 core elements of (able to last/helping the planet) development. The present study, therefore, is an attempt partly aimed at 
 (asking lots of questions about/trying to find the truth about) technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) in paddy farms 
 across (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) zones and farm size groups and 
 their interactions in the southern Indian state of 
 Tamil Nadu. 
 
 2. The study area and data 
 The state of Tamil Nadu is one of the major 
 rice-growing areas of India that is located in the 
 southeastern extremity of the Indian peninsula. With 
 basically a (related to areas near the Equator/hot and humid) climate of 18Â°C-43Â°C (minimum 
 and maximum daily temperatures), the state receives 
 an average of 925 mm once-a-year rainfall distributed 
 over four major seasons: the Southwest bad rainstorm 
 (Jun.-Dec.), Northeast bad rainstorm (Oct.-Dec.), Winter (Jan.-Feb.) and Summer (Mar.-May). A mostly red soil, lateral black and (from floodwaters) soils 
 good for (producing crops/helping something grow) of cereals and fibre crops 
 win in the state. 
 The state is divided into seven clear/separate agroclimatic zones; that is,, the Western zone (Zone-1 in this 
 study), Southern zone (Zone-11), Northeastern zone 
 (Zone-ill) and the Cauvery Delta area (Zone-IV). 
 The remaining three zones include the Northwestern 
 (dry belt) zone, the high-rainfall coastal areas and the 
 hilly zone, which completely account for (compared to other things) 
 less than 15% of the total area under rice in the state. 
 Due to their special features and the (almost nothing/very little) area 
 under rice, the last three zones were not thought about/believed 
 in this study. 
 Data having to do with crop (producing crops/helping something grow) in all agroclimatic zones of the state, collected from 60 groups 
 taken on a (fair in amount, related to something else/properly sized compared to something else) random sampling basis, are 
 available for each year in the complete big plan/layout/dishonest plan 
 for guessing the cost of (producing crops/helping something grow) for principal 
 crops (CCPC) in the Department of Farming-based 
 Money flow, Tamil Nadu Farming-based University. 
 Data for the present study refer to 129 high-cooperating with/producing/giving up 
 variety rice (IR-20) growers distributed over the 
 four zones during the major production season of 
 
 B. Tadesse, S. Krishnamoorthy j Farming-based Money flow 16 (1997) 185-192 
 
 October-December (Northeast bad rainstorm) for the year 
 1992/1993. Although rice is grown in two seasons, 
 a single production season was selected in order to 
 (make small) the effect of (change depending on the season) on input 
 use and the yield. HYV rice (IR-20) was selected 
 due to its wider (producing crops/helping something grow) in the state during the 
 particular season. Further, the analysis was limited to 
 the first four zones in order to maintain evenness, by leaving out/keeping out zones with special features and 
 which are less good for rice (producing crops/helping something grow). 
 
 3. The econometric model 
 Following the Aigner et al. (1977) and Meeusen 
 and Van den Broeck (1977) method of guessing a 
 (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area production function in which the 
 disturbance term (E) is composed of two parts, a 
 planned (V) and one-sided (U) parts/pieces, a 
 Cobb-Douglas production function of the following 
 form was specified: 
 lnlj = lnf3 0 
 
 + I:i f3;lnXij + Ej 
 
 (1) 
 
 where lj =paddy output in Quintals, X 1j =land area 
 under paddy in ha, x2j = human labour used in 
 man-days, X 3 j = animal power used in little bull h, 
 X4 j = machine power used in tractor h, X 5 j = 
 (material that makes plants grow better) (NPK) used in kg, X 6 j = Seed used in kg, 
 X7j = expenses on crop-watering/rinsing with water water, bug-killers and 
 chemicals in rupees (Rs), In = natural logarithm, and 
 the error term (E) is defined as 
 Ej = 
 
 &#126;- &#126; 
 
 187 
 
 and the ratio of the two standard errors as used by 
 Jondrow et al. (1982), 
 ,\=8uj8v 
 
 (4) 
 
 or 
 
 (5) 
 is defined as the total difference/different version of output from the 
 edge of something/unexplored area which can be attributed to technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) (Battese and Corra, 1977). Because of this, on the 
 idea (you think is true) that &#126; and &#126; are independent, the limits/guidelines of the production edge of something/unexplored area (Eq. (1)) were 
 guessed using maximum chance method by an 
 econometric software called LIMDEP. Further, given 
 a (related to multiplying numbers) production edge of something/unexplored area for which CobbDouglas production function (Eq. (1)) was specified, 
 the farm-specific technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) (TE) of the jtlt 
 farmer was guessed by using the expectation of &#126; 
 (may or may not happen, depending on something) on the random (number or thing that changes) Ej as shown by 
 Battese and Coelli (1988). That is, 
 TEj = exp(- &#126;) 
 
 (6) 
 
 So that, 
 0 .:s; TEj .:s; 1. 
 After getting farm-specific technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) using Eq. (6), the farms were separated into their 
 (pertaining to each person or thing) areas and different size groups, for 
 which the average technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) was figured out/calculated 
 and compared using F-test and changed moving backward 
 (Tobit) model. 
 
 (2) 
 
 j = 1, 2, ... n farms. 
 
 The planned part-related &#126;Â· which captures 
 random difference/different version in output due to factors outside the 
 control of the farmer, is assumed to be independently 
 and identically distributed as N (0, 8 2 v ), independent of &#126; which measures the technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) 
 relative to the (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area. Following most of 
 the scientific books, Neff et al. (1993) and Dawson and Lingard (1989), &#126; is assumed to have a 
 non-negative (one-sided) half-(usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) distribution 
 with IN (0, 8 2 u)l. 
 Now, let 8 2 u and 8 2 v be the variances of the 
 limits/guidelines one-sided (u) and planned (v ). Therefore,

 4. Results 
 Ordinary least squares (OLS) guesses of the 
 limits/guidelines which show the average performance of 
 the sample farms are presented in Table 1. With the 
 (changed to make better/changed to fit new conditions) R 2 value of 0.96, the inputs used in the 
 model were able to explain 96% of the difference/different version in 
 paddy production for the state. The coefficients of 
 land, labour, animal power and (material that makes plants grow better)s were highly 
 significant, but animal power has an unexpected 
 sign. This is because, in many of the 
 farms, own little bulls, for which the farmer pays no 
 hiring charge, are available. Because of this, given the (almost nothing/very little) opportunity cost of own little bulls, it is likely that 
 animal power could be overused. (in almost the same way), the coef-

 ficients of expenses on crop-watering/rinsing with water, bug-killers and 
 chemicals, although not significant, was unexpected. 
 On the other hand, the guesses of the (random/including random data points) 
 edge of something/unexplored area which shows the best practice performance, 
 (in other words) (producing a lot with very little waste) use of the available technology, is presented in Table 2. It is obvious from the table that the 
 guesses of A(3.1748)and u (0.2411)arelargeand 
 very different from zero, pointing to/showing a good 
 fit and the correctness of the specified distributional 
 idea (you think is true). More than that, the guess of y, which is 
 the ratio of the variance of farm-specific technical 
 (wasting very little while working or producing something) to the total variance of output, was 0.909. 
 This would mean that more than 90% of the difference/different version in output among the farms is due to the differences in technical (wasting very little while working or producing something). 
 With an upward move/change in the constant term 1 , the 
 coefficient of land, animal power and (material that makes plants grow better)s remained significant in the Cobb-Douglas (random/including random data points) 
 edge of something/unexplored area production function 2 , suggesting that farmers 
 could be (gave opinions about what could or should be done about a situation) to use more (material that makes plants grow better)s and less 
 animal power than what they now use to increase production. 
 Also, given the number of many 
 not important and small farmers in the state, from the 
 highly significant coefficient of land, we could guess 
 that it is possible to increase rice production by 
 combining holdings through cooperative effort. 
 It was also watched/followed that the farm-specific technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) varied between 0.59 and 0.97 with a 
 mean of 0.83. So, in the short run, there is a scope 
 for increasing rice production by 17%, by adopting 
 the technology and the ways of doing things used by the best 
 practice paddy farms. 
 The frequency distribution of the farm-specific 
 technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) separated into the four agroecological zones (Table 3) shows that 36.4%, 29.4%, 
 16.0% and 30.0% of farms in Zones I, II, III and IV, 
 (match up each pair of items in order), were operating at a technical (wasting very little while working or producing something)

 more farms (15.6%) in Zone III, Zone I (12.12%)

 (producing a lot with very little waste). Although, in terms of the (producing the most with the least waste)

 (55-65%) as in the other three zones.

 An upward move/change in the constant term is (designed only for/happening only within)  the COLS 
 guess procedure. However, in the maximum chance guess of the (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area, the same shift may happen, 
 although it is not a built-in nature of the model. 
 2 As an other choice to this, a more flexible production function 
 such as the translog production function was tried. However, it 
 gave low t-ratios for all inputs used and a highly significant 
 constant term.

 of no difference in the mean technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) 
 across the four (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) zones, tested using a 
 two-way ANOVA, was rejected. As the data are 
 unbalanced, the two-way ANOVA was worked out 
 through general linear model (GLM), the value of 
 which is received/made from based on the (one after the other) sum of 
 squares. The rejection of the null guess would 
 mean that at mean level, there exists significant 
 (F6, 128 a= 0.10) difference/different version in the technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) 
 (accomplished or gained) by paddy farms across the four (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) 
 zones in the state. 
 Anyway, ANOVA believes (beforehand) (usually/ in a common and regular way) distributed data. Although the data are (at first/before other things happened) (usually/ in a common and regular way) distributed, guessed (wasting very little while working or producing something) measures are 
 very (in the present analysis) half-(usually/ in a common and regular way) distributed. Because of this, the use of ANOVA may involve 
 (detailed description of exactly what is required) bias. Therefore, the technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) 
 measures were moved backward on dummies for (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) 
 zones, farm size and their interaction. These were 
 
 changed between 0 and 1 without a constant term 
 using Tobit moving backward. 
 The results were agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with the ANOVA 
 table but showed described/explained results. In the same way/in that way, 
 with a log chance ratio of - 94.021 for the changed Tobit moving backward model, t values for individual 
 coefficients pointed to/showed that farms in Zone II and Zone 
 ill are less (producing a lot with very little waste) than paddy farms in Zone IV 
 (Table 6). However, the average (wasting very little while working or producing something) reached 
 by paddy farms in Zone I was not significantly 
 different from that of paddy farms in Zone IV. 
 Further comparison by using individual 3{ coefficients of the dummy (numbers that change/things that change) by t-test (Gujaratti, 
 1995) showed that paddy farms in Zone I operate at 
 higher (wasting very little while working or producing something) levels than those in Zone II, and 
 the difference between (wasting very little while working or producing something) of farms in Zones 
 II and ill was not significant. 
 We can therefore decide that paddy farms in 
 Zones IV and I are (producing more with less waste) than those located

 in Zones II and III, (match up each pair of items in order) and regularly. 
 This would suggest that, given the existing technology 
 for rice production in Tamil Nadu, further improvement in paddy working well can be made by farms in 
 Zones II and III if extension packages are geared to 
 advising rice farms in these zones to use the practices of those in Zones IV and I. 
 A almost the same  analysis was done by collecting groups 
 of farms into small, medium and large based upon 
 the size of operational holdings 3 . This was done in 
 order to provide an understanding of the old debate on 
 the small vs. large farm size (wasting very little while working or producing something) differences 
 (difference/different version), which has not been settled yet. The 
 frequency distribution is given in Table 4. It is 
 obvious from the table that 37% of the (producing the most with the least waste) 
 (91-97% technical (wasting very little while working or producing something)) farms contain those 
 that operate small farms. The same was only 26 and 
 13% in medium and large farms, (match up each pair of items in order). On 
 the other hand, the largest proportion (14.3%) of the 
 least (producing a lot with very little waste) farms were those that operated large 
 farms while the same was about 8 and 7% for smalland medium-sized farms. 
 On these bases, the two-way ANOV A, with a 
 calculated F ratio of 6.07 at 2.128 degrees of freedom gave strong (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) to reject the null guess that there is no difference in the average technical 
 (wasting very little while working or producing something) across small-, medium- and large-sized 
 farms (Table 5). The Tobit model's dummy coeffi- 
 
 3 Small farms are those operating less than 1.5 ha of land, while 
 medium-sized farms are those operating 1.5 ha to 4.00 ha of land. 
 Those operating more than 4.00 ha of land were thought about/believed 
 large-sized farms. 
 
 cients further showed/told about the existence of significant 
 differences in technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) across the farm 
 size groups thought about/believed (Table 6). That is, paddy 
 farms on small- and medium-sized holdings operate 
 at a higher level of technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) than largesized farms. This is likely because under conditions 
 where (how easy something is to get to, use, or understand) to institutional finance depends 
 on valuable thing position, especially land (Lahiri, 1993), 
 small farms will be forced to set apart their poor/not enough

 useful things/valuable supplies more effectively. Related to this, the studies 
 of Sekar et al. (1994), Bagi (1981) and Lau and 
 Yotopoulos (1971) in different parts of India show 
 almost the same  findings. Specially in the examination of the 
 relationship between farm size and money-based (wasting very little while working or producing something), Bagi ( 1981) has shown that using more own 
 useful things/valuable supplies such as human labour, little bull power and 
 fertilisers per hectare of land, small farms reach 
 more output and better technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) than large 
 farms. 
 However, this study has not thought about/believed (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) 
 effects as an important issue of the present time. To 
 this end, the size-(related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) zone-interaction-effect 
 dummies, in the present analysis, showed/told about that 
 small-sized farms in Zone II and medium-sized farms 
 in Zone III are weird. That is, the dummy coefficients are significant (at p s 0.01 and p s 0.05) 
 suggesting small- and medium-sized paddy farms, in 
 these zones, are represented by (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth)ly size-(created unfair thinking in)/(unfair-thinking) production technologies (practices). This could 
 be taken as an advantage in the short run by the state 
 policy makers to increase rice production. 
 In a nutshell, we could guess  that the difference/different version in 
 the level of technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) among paddy farms 
 in the state exists across agro-(related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) areas and 
 the size of operational holdings also. Identification of clearly stated/particular factors that led to such differences/different versions in 
 the farm-specific technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) is of deep/extreme 
 relevance for creating plans necessary to narrow the winning/most common gap and increase working well. 
 With the given information file, this was (can't be understood). 
 However, the  useful thing/valuable supply use pattern of some of the 
 (producing the most with the least waste) (above 90% technical (wasting very little while working or producing something)) farms 
 were examined. It was found that the (producing the most with the least waste) 
 farms employed 150.94 man-days of labour, 112.22 
 h of animal power and 11.04 tractor h, used 222.48 
 kg of (material that makes plants grow better)s and 40 kg of seeds, and spent 
 Rs484.66 as payments on crop-watering/rinsing with water, bug-killers and 
 chemicals for helping grow a hectare of land, which 
 produced 57.49 quintals of paddy.

 production is more well-known/obvious. Farmers were overusing animal power in rice (producing crops/helping something grow). 
 Overall, the mean technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) of 83.3% is 
 (accomplished or gained) by paddy farms in the state showing the 
 scope for increasing paddy production by 17% with 
 the present technology (way of doing things) itself. A significant difference/different version was watched/followed in the mean level of 
 technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) among the four major rice growing zones of the state, and farmers operating on 
 small and medium sized farms (accomplished or gained) a higher 
 level of technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) than those with large 
 holdings. The farm size-(related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) zone interaction 
 effects also show/tell about that small- and medium-sized 
 paddy farms in Zones II and III, (match up each pair of items in order), are 
 operating at a higher level of technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) 
 than all other farms. 
 As a result, paddy farmers, in general, could be 
 (gave opinions about what could or should be done about a situation) on the use of less animal power, and more 
 combined use of land. Besides strengthening extension services to enable farmers to follow the  useful thing/valuable supply use pattern and practices of the paddy farms 
 in Zones IV and I, special attention should be given 
 to improve the (wasting very little while working or producing something) of paddy farms with large 
 holdings through the adoption of practices of smalland medium-sized farms, especially in Zones II and 
 III. This could help increase rice production in the 
 state in the short run.
