 Abstract 
 (having characteristics that were changed by people) (GM) crops are popular in many areas of the world, but their use/military service in Africa is interfered with by safety concerns and 
 legal/law-based issues, although the continent is in terrible  need of boosting its food production. Although people' acceptance of GM food has been 
 carefully studied in many continents, no such studies have been done in Africa. Therefore, a survey of 604 people was done in Nairobi, 
 Kenya, in 2003, to measure people' knowledge of GM crops, their desire to pay (WTP) for GM food, and the factors that influence their 
 WTP. People' knowledge of GM crops was limited and only 38% of the 604 people who responded were aware of GM crops. People in college 
 and income groups were more aware than others. (anyway/in any event), people were generally (full of thanks) of the technology, and a large majority (68%) 
 would be willing to buy GM maize meal at the same price as their favorite brand. People were, however, worried about possible side effects, 
 especially on (the health of the Earth/the surrounding conditions) and (lots of different living things all existing together). 
 WTP was guessed using a double-bounded (divided into two) choice model, and the mean WTP was found to be 13.8% higher than the average price 
 of non-GM maize meal. Perceptions of health risk, and good and equity concerns had a negative influence on the chance of buying GM 
 maize meal, whereas trust in government to secure/make sure of food quality had a positive influence on WTP. People with at least some secondary education 
 and those in the high-income category were more likely to buy GM maize meal at the same price. The study ends/decides that, because knowledge 
 is still low, appropriate communications are needed to involve the person in the debate. People' acceptance in this study was high, but the 
 research needs to be expanded to areas away from cities, where most people live, and other survey methods need to be explored.

 1. Science in Africa 
 Since their introduction in 1996, (having characteristics that were changed by people) (GM) 
 crops have spread at a rate almost never seen in the spreading around 
 of farming-based technology. In 2005, GM crops were grown on 
 90 million ha, by 8.5 million farmers in 21 countries (James, 
 2006), with more than a third of that area (33.9 million ha) 
 in developing countries. After herbicide resistance, the most 
 important feature  used in GM crops is Bt insect resistance. A (tiny chemical assembly instruction inside of living things) 
 came/coming from the common soil germ, Germ thuringiensis 
 (Bt), is inserted in the plants (especially cotton and maize), 
 which causes them to produce proteins that are poisonous  to certain 
 insect pests, in particular lepidopteran stem borer pests (FAO, 
 2004, p. 44). 
 GM crops have been the subject of an intense debate, with 
 people (who say bad things or give opinions) questioning whether the benefits outweigh the risks, and

 whether the poor will benefit. The major benefits are reduced 
 pest damage and costs of pest control. Bt crops provide very 
 good control of lepidopteran insect pests, so for farmers who 
 tend to use insecticides, as most commercial farmers do, production costs are reduced (in a big way) (FAO, 2004, p. 48). 
 Useful thing/valuable supply-poor farmers, who rarely use bug-killers, benefit from 
 reduced crop losses, and higher and more stable yields (FAO, 
 2004, p. 43; Qaim, 2003). In Kenya alone, crop losses from 
 stem borers in maize are guessed at 13.5% or 417,000 tons 
 every year (De Groote, Bett, et al., 2004). In South Africa, Bt cotton has been shown to increase produces and reduce costs for small 
 holders (Thirtle et al., 2003). Reduced bug-killer use is also helpful to (the health of the Earth/the surrounding conditions) and to human health (McGloughlin, 
 1999). 
 The adoption of GM crops has been very fast in North 
 and South America and most parts of Asia. GM crops were 
 first approved in the United States, for feed as well as food, 
 and are now accepted by most people (Ganiere and Chern, 
 2004). Between 60 and 70% of processed foods sold in U.S.

 supermarket is guessed to contain (having characteristics of a living thing controlled by people) ingredients (Onyango et al., 2006). 
 In Europe and Japan, however, adoption has been slow and 
 personal acceptance has been a major factor (Chern et al., 
 2002; Zhang et al., 2004). Safety and legal/law-based concerns still 
 make up/be equal to a major hurdle for developing countries (FAO, 2004), 
 as well as the fear of losing export markets (Curtis and Moeltner, 
 2006). This is a particular problem for Africa, with its high 
 population growth and high levels of food (state of not being safe/source of mental worry), as it stands 
 to gain most from GM crops. 
 In Sub-Saharan Africa, only South Africa is growing GM 
 crops commercially (Eicher et al., 2006), with 0.5 million ha 
 in 2005 (James, 2006). It is also the only country where a 
 staple GM food crop is grown (Eicher et al., 2006; Gouse et al., 
 2006). A few other countries are at different stages of trials 
 for different GM crops. In Kenya, confined field trials with Bt 
 maize and Bt cotton are (happening now) (Mugo et al., 2005). Trials 
 with Bt cotton are also (happening now) in Tanzania, Mali, and Burkina 
 Faso. Research is being managed and did/done on Bt cowpeas in Zimbabwe, 
 virus-resistant cassava in Kenya, disease-resistant bananas in 
 Uganda, and GM potatoes in South Africa. Egypt, however, 
 has halted the (making something available for lots of people to buy) of GM potatoes, (even though there is the existence of) years 
 of successful research, for fear of losing its (related to Europe) export 
 market (Eicher et al., 2006). 
 Because of its importance, many studies of personal acceptance have happened in the developed countries and Asia 
 (Curtis et al., 2004). Although Africa could benefit (in a big way) 
 from GM technology and GM varieties are being produced for 
 this area, almost the same  research on the opinions of African people or producers is missing. Such studies are important because the successful introduction of GM crops into Africa will 
 depend mostly on personal acceptance (Horseain et al., 2003; 
 Trapr et al., 2002). 
 The critical crop for East and Southern Africa is likely to be 
 Bt maize. Maize is the most important food staple in this area, but production has not kept up with population growth (De 
 Groote et al., 2005). Major restrictions as perceived by farmers 
 are lack of cash, access to technology and improved seed, and 
 soil life-creating ability, whereas the major pest problems are stem borers 
 and storage pests (De Groote, Okuro, et al., 2004). Therefore, 
 the Insect Resistant Maize for Africa (IRMA) project--a group effort of the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre (CIMMYT) and the Kenya Farming-based Research 
 Institute (KARI)--is developing maize varieties resistant to pest 
 stem borers, using both ordinary breeding and Bt technology (Mugo et al., 2005). 
 To study the acceptance of Bt maize by people, a survey was carried out in Nairobi in 2003, exploring people' 
 knowledge of GM crops and their attitudes toward GM foods 
 in general. Desire to pay (WTP) was guessed through 
 the contingent (putting a value on something) (CV) method, and the factors that 
 influence people' acceptance and mean WTP were carefully studied. This article reports the results of that study. To our 
 knowledge, this is the first study of people' attitudes and 
 acceptance of a major GM crop in Sub-Saharan Africa, and 
 
 the first study to use CV and the double-bound method in the 
 area. 
 2. Personal acceptance of GM food 
 Person acceptance of GM foods differs (in a big way) 
 around the world. In the United States, people generally 
 accept GM products (Ganiere and Chern, 2004), and the premiums they are willing to pay for non-GM products are small 
 (Chen and Chern, 2002). A study comparing U.S. and Chinese 
 people found their attitudes generally supportive of the new 
 technology (Zhang et al., 2004). (related to Europe) people, on the 
 other hand, have strong serious doubt about GM crops. In the 
 United Kingdom, only few people would accept to eat GM 
 food, even with a discount (Moon et al., 2004). U.K. people 
 would pay much higher premiums for non-GM food than their 
 U.S. partners (Moon and Balasubramanian, 2001). On average, 73% of people in 15 (related to Europe) countries rejected 
 GM food, ranging from 58% in the United Kingdom to 85% in 
 Greece (Trapr et al., 2002). Swedish people, especially, disliked GM food, and would even pay a lot to ban 
 GM feed for their animals (Carlsson et al., 2004). 
 In Asia, Japan and Korea stand out as countries with low 
 personal acceptance for GM food, compared with China and 
 Taiwan (Kim and Kim, 2004). People in Beijing were willing to pay more for GM food (38% for rice and 16% for GM 
 soybean) than for the ordinary partner (Li et al., 2002). 
 In Korea, large numbers of people are willing to buy GM 
 products when offered at a discount (Kim and Kim, 2004). Compared with developed nations and Asia, however, few studies 
 have talked to/looked at personal acceptance of GM crops in developing countries, especially in Africa. 
 A few factors have been found that influence personal acceptance of GM food. In the United States, people' perceptions and attitudes toward GM food were found to influence 
 their WTP (Kaneko and Chern, 2003), and the perception that 
 GM food offers particular benefits such as a price discount, 
 health attributes, or (things that are good for the planet) had a positive effect 
 (Ganiere and Chern, 2004). Income and presence of children 
 in the household, on the other hand, had a negative effect on 
 U.S. people who responded' acceptance of GM food products, and female 
 people who responded and middle-(old/allowed to get old/got older) people were found to be willing to pay a higher higher cost for non-GM food products (Chen 
 and Chern, 2002). 
 In Europe, negative perceptions of GM food were found 
 to decrease WTP, both in the United Kingdom (Moon and 
 Balasubramanian, 2004) and Belgium (Verdurme and Viaene, 
 2003). Thinking-related factors came out as the most important factors to explain the differences in WTP between EU countries 
 (Trapr et al., 2002), with risk perception having a negative 
 effect on WTP, and beliefs, knowledge, and trust in government 
 having a positive effect. 
 In China, people' positive opinions toward GM rice 
 and soybean oil increase their WTP, and higher knowledge 
 levels increased the WTP for GM soybean oil (Li et al., 2002). In 
 
 S. C. Kimenju, H. De Groote / Farming-based Money flow 38 (2008) 35-46 
 
 Japan, concern about food safety and knowledge about science decrease WTP for GM food (McCluskey et al., 2003). 
 Person acceptance was much higher in countries with lowrisk perceptions such as China, than in countries with high-risk 
 perceptions such as Romania (Curtis and Moeltner, 2006). People in developing nations (China and Colombia) were found 
 to have more positive attitudes than those in developed countries 
 (UK and US; Curtis et al., 2004). 
 It can be argued that food security problems are more important in developing countries, whereas perceived levels of risk 
 may be smaller because of a higher trust in government, more 
 positive perceptions of science, and more positive media influences. (in almost the same way), per person food production struggles to keep 
 pace with population growth in Sub-Saharan Africa, and serious food shortages are a regular event, so arguments in 
 favor of GM crops are stronger (De Groote, Mugo, et al., 2004; 
 Pinstrup-Andersen and Schioler, 2002). The fear of losing export markets, on the other hand, is a negative factor for many 
 developing countries, and was the major reason why Romania stopped the (making something available for lots of people to buy) of GM crops (Curtis and 
 Moeltner, 2006) and Egypt the development of GM potatoes 
 (Eicher et al., 2006). However, the risk of losing export markets 
 for Kenyan maize can be thought about/believed small. The country rarely 
 produces enough maize for export (the last time was in 1996), 
 as the country struggles to meet food independence and had to 
 import on average 335,000 tons every year over the last 10 years 
 (FAO Statistics Division, 2007). About 50% of the Kenyan 
 population doesn't have access to (good) enough food, and the government 
 has been spending roughly US$40-65 million every year on food 
 relief (Republic of Kenya, 2004). 
 
 3. Way(s) of doing things 
 Based on this book-related review, and given a limited budget, 
 good places/locations were selected, a sample survey designed with 
 good tools, and the right/the proper idea-based and (related to careful studying or deep thinking) 
 (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) developed. 
 
 3.1. Site selection and data collection 
 People' access to information and knowledge of GM 
 food are likely to be higher in city-based  areas, and surveys in these 
 areas are cheaper and easier to organize. Therefore, Nairobi 
 was selected for the first personal survey on GM food. Interviews were done in November and December 2003 at three 
 types of outlets: supermarkets, small stores/computers (small roadside shops), 
 and fancyo mills (small hammer mills). Supermarkets provide 
 a wide variety of finished maize products at central locations, 
 serving higher-income groups. Small stores/computers also provide finished 
 products, but in a much smaller mixed group of things, and are in 
 (where there are lots of homes) areas. Fancyo mills, mechanical hammer mills, are 
 usually found in neighborhoods with high concentrations of 
 poor families. Their clients bring maize grain from 
 
 37 
 
 the market and have it ground to flour, resulting in a less high-quality 
 but much cheaper meal. 
 From a list of supermarkets received/got from Kenya's Central 
 Bureau of Statistics, 15 supermarkets were randomly selected: 
 10 large ones (with more than three local branches), and 5 small 
 ones. For the small stores/computers, seven huge houses ((related to managing and running a company or organization) subdivisions 
 of Nairobi) were selected from a list of city huge houses, and three 
 small stores/computers randomly selected per estate. Twenty-one fancyo mills 
 were randomly selected from the 16 huge houses known to house 
 them, and the number selected in each was (fair in amount, related to/properly sized, related to) the 
 total number in the estate. 
 In total, 604 people were interviewed: 183 at supermarkets, 210 at small stores/computers, and 211 at fancyo mills. Five enumerators 
 were hired and trained specifically for this survey. In the selected outlets, they approached every third person looking 
 for maize products and asked for an interview. Interviewing 
 people was harder in the supermarkets where shoppers were usually in a hurry and about one out of every four 
 shoppers approached refused to cooperate, mostly referring to lack 
 of time. Another 27 shoppers left without completing the interview as they thought it was taking too long, reducing the 
 number of interviews to 183 for this type of outlet. People 
 in the other outlets, however, had more time, and only a few 
 people in the small stores/computers refused to be interviewed, and none in 
 the fancyo mills. 
 First, the people' knowledge of GM crops was tested by 
 checking whether they had read or heard about science 
 and GM crops in general, and about Bt maize, Bt cotton, and 
 virus-resistant sweet potato especially. People who responded aware 
 of GM crops were then given/gave the whole list of questions, 
 whereas those unaware were first presented with a short explanation of the scientific background of GM crops, their advantages and disadvantages, and the countries now growing 
 them (see Add on). In order to control for possible order effects, two formats of the list of questions were developed. Half 
 of them presented the short explanation with benefits of GM 
 crops first, whereas the other half presented risks first. After the 
 presentation, those (before that/before now) unaware were also given/gave 
 the list of questions. This list of questions included questions about 
 people' sources of information on GM crops, their attitudes 
 toward GM food, their information about people, and their 
 WTP for GM food. 
 Risk perceptions of people were gauged by asking people who responded if they agreed or disagreed with 16 statements on the 
 risks and benefits connected with GM crops, and how strongly. 
 There were four statements on benefit perception, three each 
 for (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) risk and health risk perceptions, and six for 
 equity and good concerns. The replies were changed into 
 a score (from a'1 for "totally disagree," a'0.5 for "disagree," 
 0 for "neutral," 0.5 for "agree," and 1 for "totally agree"). 
 The scores were then averaged to form a perception index for 
 each category: benefit perceptions (IBP ), health risk perceptions 
 (IHRP ), (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) risk perceptions (IERP ), and good and 
 equity concerns (IEEC ). Age was expressed in years, and (male/female status) 
 changed into a dummy (number or thing that changes) (1 for female, 0 for male).

 People who responded were classified into four education categories, according to the highest education level reached: no education or 
 some first (or most important) (combined, because only six people who responded did not 
 attend any school); at least some secondary education, at least 
 some third/(related to three) college; and at least some university education, 
 with a binary (number or thing that changes) for each category. Finally, people who responded 
 were classified into five income categories: people without income (leaving out/keeping out students), students without income (because 
 their behavior often reflects that of higher-income groups), people with a poor of up to 15,000 Kenyan shilling (KShs) 
 per month, middle income (between KShs 15,001 and KShs 
 50,000), and high income (more than KShs 50,000/month) 
 (US$1 = KShs 75 at the time of the survey). Of the 604 people who responded, 52 had some missing values, so 553 remained for 
 the moving backward analysis. 
 This is the first study of its kind to use maize meal outlets, 
 layered by type, as the first stage in the sampling design. This 
 design avoids the expense of building a sampling frame, 
 typical for the common, city-based  household surveys with city 
 blocks or huge houses as the first stage. Another (pretty, inexpensive toy/the quality of being new) is the use of 
 indices to number personal attitudes, allowing the guess 
 of not important effects on WTP. 
 3.2. Person (features/ qualities/ traits), knowledge, and attitudes 
 Overall, there were (a) little more men (55%) than women in 
 the sample. Most people who responded had attended school, and had either some first (or most important) education (20%), some secondary education 
 (40%), or higher (39%) (Table 1). Most people who responded worked, 
 either in formal employment (41%) or self-employment (29%). 
 Almost half (48%) had an income below KShs 15,000, and 
 a large group (28%) had no income. Most of the people 
 (72%) lived in families together with children under 18. The 
 (how money affects people's lives) (features/ qualities/ traits) of maize people surveyed in 
 
 this study differed (in a big way) between the different types of 
 outlets. Supermarkets, especially, had more clients with formal employment, university education, and higher income. This 
 had an effect on people' knowledge and attitudes, which has 
 been carefully studied in other places (Kimenju et al., 2005). Average sample statistics, however, compare well with the city's population 
 (features/ qualities/ traits) came/coming from the 1999 (official count of everyone who lives in a country, city, etc.). The (official count of everyone who lives in a country, city, etc.)  found 
 56% of Nairobi residents older than 14 years to be male, with 
 few people having no education, a large group (52%) with at 
 least some secondary education, and a large group who worked 
 for pay (37%; Central Bureau of Statistics, 2001). 
 Almost half of the people who responded (46%) had heard or read 
 something about science, and (a) little less (38%) about 
 GM crops (Table 1). Of those people who responded who were aware of 
 GM crops, 95% were aware of the term "gene"; 65% had heard 
 of virus-resistant sweet potato; 54% knew about Bt maize; and 
 21% about Bt cotton. These numbers likely reflect the order 
 of introduction of the different GM crops in Kenya. Virusresistant sweet potatoes were introduced in 2000, Bt maize 
 in 2001, and Bt cotton in 2004. Trust in the government was 
 high: most people who responded (76%) thought that there were (good) enough 
 government controls to secure/make sure of food quality. 
 There were large differences in knowledge between the (how money affects people's lives) groups. It increased strongly with education, from 
 17% in those with no formal education to 90% for those with 
 some university education. Knowledge increased strongly with 
 income, from 28% for those with no income (leaving out/keeping out students) to 92% for those with monthly incomes of over KShs 
 50,000 per month (around US$667). Men were more aware 
 (45%) than women (29%). 
 Most of the people who responded agreed (73%) or strongly agreed 
 (9%) that GM crops can increase working well (Table 2). The 
 average score for the perception of increased working well was 
 calculated at 0.38 (from a'1 for "strongly disagree" to 1 for 
 "strongly agree"). (in almost the same way), most people who responded agreed that GM 
 crops could reduce bug-killers on food (average score 0.37) and 
 in (the health of the Earth/the surrounding conditions) (0.32) and improve the (related to vitamins, protein, etc., in food) quality 
 (0.36). Averaging the score for the four questions on potential 
 benefits gave/given a perception index IBP , with an average of 
 0.36. People who responded aware of GM crops had (a) little lower benefit 
 perceptions, reflected in higher scores, than the others. 
 Many people who responded, however, had concerns about (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) risks. More than half of the people agreed that GM 
 crops could cause death of nontarget insects (score = 0.11), and 
 can lead to the loss of land races (score = 0.07). However, more 
 than half of the people who responded disagreed with the general statement that GM threatens (the health of the Earth/the surrounding conditions) (a negative score of 
 a'0.09). Averaging the three scores led to a (a) little positive index of (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) risk perception (IERP= 0.03). People 
 aware of GM crops had (a) little higher (surrounding conditions) risk perceptions (IERP = 0.07) than the others (IERP = 0.01). 
 People who responded' opinion about the effect of GM food on human 
 health was mixed. Asked if GM foods would cause (likely to have a strong, bad body reaction) reaction, about equal numbers disagreed (39%) as agreed (40%). 
 (a) little more people disagreed with the statement that GM

 food can damage one's health (48%) than agreed (37%). (in almost the same way), more people disagreed with the statement that GM foods 
 could lead to an increase in (hard to treat) sicknesses (43% 
 vs. 35%), leading to a (a) little negative index of health risk 
 perception (IHRP = a'0.02; Table 2). 
 
 About half of the people agreed that (related to tiny chemical assembly instructions inside of living things) change is tampering with nature and that GM food is (not made by nature/fake). 
 Otherwise, more people disagreed with the good and equity 
 concerns, in particular that GM technology developers are playing God (72%), and that GM products are being forced upon

 developing countries (54%), that they only benefit the huge companies (64%) and not the small-scale farmer (71%). This led 
 to a (a) little negative perception score (IEEC = a'0.10), with 
 the group aware of GM crops having a (a) little higher index 
 of good and equity concerns (IEEC = a'0.08) than the others 
 (IEEC = a'0.12; Table 2). 
 3.3. Idea-based (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) 
 CV is a survey-based method of bringing out how people 
 test products (that are bought and sold)  and services not found in the market place. 
 These surveys only give meaningful results if they are properly 
 grounded in a personal (biggest increase/best possible extent) (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) (Hanemann 
 and Kanninen, 1998). It is generally assumed that people 
 (make as big as possible) their utility subject to a budget restriction and will, 
 therefore, choose the option that gives them the highest utility. In this big picture, WTP is the most money a 
 person would be willing to pay for the new product. Different people have different WTP for a particular good, and it is 
 the distribution of this WTP among the target population that 
 offers interesting market information. This distribution can be 
 guessed through open-ended or close-ended questions. Openended questions provide direct guesses and are easy to carefully study, but people often find it hard to state their WTP for a new 
 product (Hanemann and Kanninen, 1998). Close-ended questions are closer to real-life situations and have, therefore, become the method of choice (Arrow et al., 1993). In this method, 
 WTP is not directly watched/followed, but ideas (you think are true) about its distribution can be made, and its limits/guidelines, including the mean 
 WTP of a population in money-based terms, can be guessed from 
 survey data (Lusk and Hudson, 2004). 
 A few approaches have been developed, including the 
 single-bounded, the double-bounded, and the multi-bounded 
 approaches. In the single-bounded, (divided into two) choice approach, the person who responded is offered only one bid (a certain product 
 at a certain price), to accept or reject. This method is (reward or reason for doing something) 
 compatible because it is in the person who responded's (related to a plan to reach a goal) interest to 
 accept whether her WTP is greater or equal to the price asked 
 and to reject otherwise (Mitchell and Carson, 1989). Utility 
 (biggest increase/best possible extent) hints that a person will then only answer "yes" 
 to the offered bid if his maximum WTP is greater or equal 
 to the bid. However, the method needs/demands a large sample size 
 and is (related to numbers) not very (producing a lot with very little waste) (Hanemann et al., 1991). In 
 the double-bounded approach, a second bid is offered, higher or 
 lower depending on the first response. This method incorporates 
 more information about an person's WTP and, therefore, 
 provides (producing more with less waste) guesses and tighter confidence periods of time (or space) (Hanemann et al., 1991). The double-bounded approach 
 has been used a lot in valuing nonmarket products (that are bought and sold), as well 
 as for personal acceptance of GM crops (Kaneko and Chern, 
 2003; Li et al., 2002; McCluskey et al., 2003). The analysis, 
 however, needs/demands maximum chance guess, and the (understanding/ explanation) is not always plain/honest/easy. 
 (not very long ago), multiple-bounded and polychotomous choice 
 methods are being explored, which offer many bids as well 
 
 as multiple response options (Alberini et al., 2003). They allow 
 for many bids, which is useful when limited information is 
 available at first to decide which bids to include. They also 
 allow for many choices, which offer the possibility of including options for doubt. Multiple-bounded approaches 
 are, however, subject to design bias, and are influenced by the 
 range of bids included (Roach et al., 2002; Vossler et al., 2004). 
 The hidden (under) ideas (you think are true) of the approach when including 
 doubt is still under debate (Vossler and Poe, 2005). More 
 research, now under way, is expected to shed more light 
 on these issues. 
 When this survey was managed and did/done, however, multiple-bounded 
 models were still being developed, so the double-bounded 
 model was chosen. This method has a good possible reason; it is (reward or reason for doing something) compatible and leads to fair guesses. It is (producing more with less waste) than the single-bounded approach 
 (Hanemann et al., 1991) and has been used in many person 
 studies on acceptance of GM food. The maximum chance 
 procedure using the logistic distribution is fairly plain/honest/easy with standard econometric software. More than that, average 
 prices of related products are (good or well enough) known to help set the 
 bids. 
 Mentally, the WTP of a group of people for a particular product at a price (or bid) B can be assumed to have a 
 certain chance distribution function. More than that, this distribution function can be seen as a function of the price, with a 
 higher price having a lesser chance of being accepted. In 
 applied research, the logistic distribution is commonly used, 
 and the effect of the price is entered indirectly in an argument 
 called the index function, represented as v. The most common index 
 function is linear in the price or bid, B: 
 v = Î± a' ÏB, 
 
 (1) 
 
 and the chance distribution of the WTP is then presented 
 by 
 P (WTP = B) = exp(v)/(1 + exp(v))2 . 
 
 (2) 
 
 The logistic function has the advantage of a closed-form 
 total distribution function G(.), which then represents the 
 proportion of people/of the group whose WTP lies below a certain 
 value B: 
 G(B) = P (WTP &amp;lt; B) = exp(v)/(1 + exp(v)). 
 
 (3) 
 
 People who would accept an offer of value B are those whose 
 WTP is equal to, or higher than, B (Hanemann and Kanninen, 
 1998; Hanemann et al., 1991). 
 In the double-bounded (divided into two) choice model, the person is presented with two in-a-row bids, and the second 
 bid depends on the response to the first. If the personal answers 
 "yes" to the first bid (Bi ), the second bid (Biu ) is set higher, but 
 if the individual responds "no" to the first bid, the second bid 
 (Bid ) is set lower. There are four possible results: "yes" to the 
 first bid followed by a "yes" to the second bid (with chance 
 
 S. C. Kimenju, H. De Groote / Farming-based Money flow 38 (2008) 35-46 
 
 represented by Ï yy ); "yes" followed by "no" (Ï yn ); "no" followed 
 by "yes" (Ï ny ); and two in-a-row "no" answers (Ï nn ). To receive information on a wider range of values, different amounts 
 for the bids are assigned randomly between people who responded i. The 
 chance of receiving a "yes" answer to both questions equals 
 the chance that the person who responded's WTP is higher than the 
 highest bid offered: 
 Ï yy Bi , Biu = Pr Biu &amp;lt; W T Pi = 1 a' G Biu . 
 
 (4) 
 
 (in almost the same way), the chance of receiving a "yes" followed by a 
 "no" equals the chance that the WTP of person who responded i lies 
 between the first bid and the second, higher bid offered: 
 Ï yn Bi , Biu = Pr Bi &amp;lt; W T Pi &amp;lt; Biu 
 = G Biu a' G(Bi ). 
 
 (5) 
 
 The chance of receiving a "no" followed by a "yes" is 
 again the chance that WTPi lies between the first and the 
 second, now lower, bid offered: 
 Ï ny Bi , Bid = Pr Bid &amp;lt; W T Pi &amp;lt; Bi 
 = G(Bi ) a' G Bid . 
 
 (6) 
 
 Ï nn Bi , Bid = Pr Bid &amp;lt; W T P 
 
 i 
 
 = G Bid . 
 
 (7) 
 
 Combining the chances of the four results, the loglikelihood function for a sample of N people takes the form

 ln LD (Î¸ ) =

 give more attention to the demand for (made different), often 
 called/labeled food products, to the disaggregation of people/of the group, 
 and to a recognition that traditional information about people may 
 have limited explanatory power (Senauer, 2001). Even if there 
 is an unemotional measure of a particular quality, it does not follow 
 that all people perceive quality in the same way. It is not 
 unusual to find that one consumer's utility increases with a particular quality, whereas another consumer's utility decreases. 
 In such cases, demand for quality depends on an person's 
 knowledge and perception of that quality, as well as trust in the 
 people in charge guarding this quality. The effect of these factors on 
 people' acceptance of GM food has already been (showed/shown or proved) in a few studies in developed countries and Asia, as 
 was reviewed earlier, but no such studies have been conducted 
 in Africa. 
 Given the general nature of personal explanation, we explore 
 whether the same thinking-related (numbers that change/things that change) influence WTP in Africa, 
 in addition to price and (how money affects people's lives) factors. Formally, the 
 chance of personal i buying a new product, in particular a 
 GM food, when offered at a certain price Bi can be guessed 
 to be a function of a vector of thinking-related and (how money affects people's lives) 
 factors zi : 
 Ï y (Bi , z i ) = Ï y (vi ), 
 
 Finally, the chance of receiving two "no" answers is equal 
 to the chance that WTPi lies below the second, lowest bid 
 offered: 
 
 ny 
 
 where di , dinn , di , and di are binary (numbers that change/things that change) with 1 representing 
 the event of that particular result, and 0 otherwise. To 
 operationalize this model, we need to specify the total amount of 
 distribution function G(-). We use the logistic function (Eq. (3)) 
 with a linear index function (Eq. (1)). Substituting this function 
 for G(-) in Eqs. (4)-(7) fully specifies the chances of the 
 four results and the chance function (Eq. (8)). Limit/guideline 
 guesses can then be gotten by making the most of the chance 
 function, the mean WTP is calculated as Î±/Ï (Hanemann and 
 Kanninen, 1998; Hanemann et al., 1991), and the standard errors 
 are calculated using the helping thing method. 
 3.4. Factors that influence WTP 
 Market analyses usually/(in the past) deal with the demand for (group of things that are all pretty much the same) products (that are bought and sold), figured out by/decided by a set of (connected/related) prices and information about people. Demand for quality qualities, however, need not 
 be figured out by/decided by the same set of (numbers that change/things that change). Research needs to 
 
 41 
 
 (9) 
 
 where Î½ i , as defined earlier, is the index function with the pre-planned relationship between Bi and zi , thought here to be 
 linear: 
 vi = Î± a' ÏBi + Î» z i + Îµi , 
 
 (10) 
 
 and Îµi is a random term. As in the basic model of the previous 
 section, the chance of a bid being accepted (either the first 
 or the second bid in the double-bounded method), taking into 
 account other person (features/ qualities/ traits), becomes 
 Ï y (vi ) = 1 a' G(vi ) or Ï y (Bi , z i ) 
 = 1 a' 1/(1 + exp(Î± a' ÏBi + Î» z i )). 
 
 (11) 
 
 The proper log-chance function for the double-bound 
 method can then be built in comparison to Eq. (8). 
 Based on results from studies on GM food from other areas 
 worldwide, the thinking-related factors included were knowledge of 
 GM technology (binary (number or thing that changes)), perceptions of GM food as 
 measured by the benefit perception index (IBP ), health perception index (IHRP ), good and equity concerns index (IEEC ), and 
 having trust in the government (yes = 1, no = 0). 
 Further, the (how money affects people's lives) (numbers that change/things that change) such as age, (male/female status), 
 presence of children in the household, education, and income 
 were included. For education, binary (numbers that change/things that change) were included 
 for at least some secondary, third/(related to three) college, or university education, with none or at least some first (or most important) education as base. 
 For income, binary (numbers that change/things that change) were included for students without income and for the low-, middle- and high-income groups. 
 The group without income, leaving out/keeping out students, was used as the 
 base.

 Fig. 1. People' desire to buy GM maize meal at the same price as their preferred brand (first bid), at a higher cost (second bid, after they accepted the first 
 bid), or at a discount (second bid, after they rejected the first bid). 
 
 People were first asked which is their favorite maize 
 meal brand, and which price they usually pay for a 2-kg packet. 
 Then, they were asked whether they would be willing to buy 
 GM maize meal at that same price, in Kenya shillings for a 
 2 kg packet. Those who answered "yes" were then asked if 
 they would be willing to buy GM maize meal at a higher price 
 (higher cost). Therefore, different higher cost levels were assigned 
 randomly to different people who responded (5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, or 
 50% of the price of their favorite brand), but each person who responded 
 was only offered one second bid: the price of their favorite brand 
 plus the random high-quality level, calculated by the enumerator 
 and expressed in KShs per 2-kg packet. 
 People who responded who answered "no" to the first bid were offered 
 a lower price; the price of their favorite brand, reduced by a 
 randomly assigned discount (5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, or 50%), 
 calculated in KShs/2 kg. The higher cost or discount percentages 
 were equally distributed across the sample. The average price 
 of the people' favorite brand was 51 KShs/2 kg, and the 
 second bid ranged from 18 to 105 KShs/2 kg. 
 To calculate the mean WTP, the simple model (without personal (features/ qualities/ traits) or setting, all Î»i = 0) was guessed first 
 with the maximum chance procedure, and average WTP was 
 calculated as Î±/Ï. The confidence period of time (or space) for mean WTP was 
 guessed with the helping thing method (Greene, 1991). Then the 
 full model, including personal (features/ qualities/ traits), was guessed. 
 Not important effects were calculated to decide/figure out the influence of 
 people who responded' (features/ qualities/ traits) on WTP. The mean WTP was calculated from the full model, by (changing to make better/changing to fit new conditions) the Î± to include the 
 guessed limits/guidelines and the average values for the vector of 
 factors z : 
 E(WTP|Î±, Î», Ï, z ) = [_((Î± + Î» z )/Ï] 
 
 (12) 
 
 (after Haab and McConnel, 2002, p. 35). The standard error 
 was again calculated using the helping thing method. 
 The results of the different steps in this research way(s) of doing things 
 are presented in the next section, covering the level of knowledge 
 and desire to buy GM maize meal, the guess of the 
 short model and calculation of the average WTP for GM maize, 
 and the analysis of the different factors influencing this WTP. 
 4. Results 
 A large majority of the surveyed people (68%) would be 
 willing to buy GM maize meal at the same price as their favorite 
 maize meal brand. They are represented by the hatched bars in 
 Fig. 1. A third of the people (32%), however, rejected the 
 first bid. They were then offered a discount, ranging from 5% to 
 50% of the price of their favorite brand, but presented as a money-based amount (in KShs for a 2 kg packet). Of those who were 
 offered the largest discount (50%), almost half (41%) would accept. In other words, an added 13% of people (32% Ã-- 
 41%), would be willing to buy GM maize meal if offered a 
 discount of 50%. This is represented by the gray section of the 
 first bar at the left of Fig. 1. Because 68% of people would 
 already buy it at no discount (hatched proportion of the bar), a 
 total of 81% of people would buy GM maize at the 50% 
 discount (represented by the stacked bars). The proportion of 
 people accepting the bid generally (lowered in number/got worse/gotten worse) with its size, 
 down to 31% of people accepting the 5% discount. This 
 represents 9% (32% Ã-- 31%) of all people, so on top of 
 the 68% who accepted the first bid, this makes 77% of people who would buy GM maize at a 5% discount (fifth bar in 
 Fig. 1).

 (meaningful numbers) at the 99% confidence level. 
 
 The 68% of people who accepted the first bid (central 
 bar, at 0% higher cost or discount) were then asked whether they 
 would be willing to buy GM maize meal at a higher price, 
 or a higher cost, ranging from 5% to 50%. Of those offered a 
 higher cost of 5%, half would accept (next bar on the right). At 
 a higher cost of 10%, most people (43%) would still accept. 
 The proportion of people willing to accept the bid generally 
 decreased with its size, with a quarter of people (26%) still 
 willing to accept the highest higher cost of 50% (last bar on the 
 right in Fig. 1). The bars roughly represent the logistic curve of 
 decreasing WTP with increased price. 
 To calculate the mean WTP, the logistic curve was fitted on 
 the data, and the coefficients of the restricted Eq. (8) were guessed (Table 3). The mean WTP was calculated from the coefficients as Î±/Ï = KShs 58.0 (standard error of 1.129, confidence 
 period of time (or space) 55.75-60.18). This price was an increase of 13.8% over 
 the average price for the favorite brand (51.0 KShs/2 kg packet), 
 
 43 
 
 pointing to/showing that people are willing to pay a lot for GM 
 maize meal. 
 To carefully study the hit/effect of different factors on WTP, the limits/guidelines of the expanded model (Eq. (11)) were guessed, the 
 not important effects calculated at the means of the explanatory (numbers that change/things that change), and the mean WTP recalculated (Table 4). Calculating the 
 mean WTP from the guessed coefficients of the full model, 
 following Eq. (12), results in an guess of 57.9 KShs/2 kg 
 packet, (a) little less than the first guess, but still leading to a 
 higher cost of 13.8%. 
 Among the factors tested, knowledge of GM crops was clearly 
 not significant. This is not unexpected, because unaware people were given an explanatory text on the topic. 
 The information gave/given did not seem to influence their WTP 
 in a way different from aware people, who did not receive 
 that information. People' perceptions, on the other hand, 
 were very important. Interestingly, the effects of the positive 
 benefit perceptions were not significant, whereas the effects of 
 the negative perceptions, health risks, and concerns about (rules and beliefs related to doing the right thing) 
 and equity were large and significant. Trust in the government's 
 ability to control and control the industry, on the other hand, 
 was a strong positive factor. 
 The size of the effects can be gauged by carefully studying the 
 not important effects, which are indicators of percentage change in 
 people willing to pay, when all other factors, including price, are 
 kept at their average value. An increase in the health perception 
 index of 1, for example, decreased the number of people 
 willing to pay for GM maize meal, at the average price, by 
 18%. An increase in the good and equity perception index

 S. C. Kimenju, H. De Groote / Farming-based Money flow 38 (2008) 35-46 
 
 by 1 reduced the percentage of people willing to pay by 13%, 
 whereas people who trusted the government were 18% more 
 likely to pay for GM maize meal. 
 Of the (how money affects people's lives) (features/ qualities/ traits), only education and 
 income showed significant effects. Age, (male/female status), and presence of 
 children did not have significant effects. The effect of education 
 was mixed, however. People with some secondary education 
 had a much higher WTP than those with either less or 
 more education, but those with college levels did not. 
 WTP does clearly increase with income, and people in the 
 high-income group are 30% more likely to buy GM food. 
 
 5. Ends/end results 
 The survey results point to/show that more than a third (38%) of 
 the people in Nairobi were aware of GM crops. People 
 with college and income levels are usually more 
 aware. Most people (68%) would be willing to 
 buy GM maize meal at the price of their favorite maize meal 
 brand. On average, they would even be willing to pay more: 
 a 13.8% payment over the average price. Nairobi people' 
 acceptance of GM food is just like that in other developing 
 countries such as China, Colombia (Curtis et al., 2004; Zhang 
 et al., 2004), United States (Chen and Chern, 2002; Ganiere and 
 Chern, 2004), and Taiwan (Kim and Kim, 2004). They clearly 
 differ from people in Europe (Moon and Balasubramanian, 
 2001; Moon et al., 2004; Trapr et al., 2002), Japan, and South 
 Korea (Kim and Kim, 2004). However, although people who responded in 
 this study generally appreciated the positive benefits of the GM 
 technology, they were worried about the potential negative 
 effects, especially on (the health of the Earth/the surrounding conditions) and the loss of land races. 
 Econometric guess points to/shows that these person perceptions have an effect on WTP, as has been watched/followed in other places. Knowledge and positive perceptions of the technology, 
 however, did not have significant effects, unlike the result of 
 person studies in China (Li et al., 2002). Negative perceptions, in particular perceived negative effects on health, had a 
 clear negative effect on WTP, as watched/followed in other countries 
 (Curtis and Moeltner, 2006; McCluskey et al., 2003). Perceived 
 good and equity concerns also influenced WTP negatively. 
 Trust in the government's ability to secure/make sure of food quality had 
 a positive influence on WTP, as has been watched/followed in Europe 
 (Trapr et al., 2002). Among (how money affects people's lives) factors, only income and education significantly influenced WTP, almost the same as 
 the findings of Chen and Chern (2002) who found that U.S. 
 people with more money were willing to pay more. People with at least some secondary education have higher WTP 
 for GM maize meal than those with only some first (or most important) education. (in almost the same way), people with an income higher than KShs 
 50,000 per month have a higher WTP than those in the lowest income categories. People' information about people 
 such as age, (male/female status), and presence of children had no significant 
 effects, unlike in people in the United States (Chen and 
 Chern, 2002). 
 
 It also comes out that general knowledge on science 
 and GM technology is limited, and that some people' 
 WTP for GM crops is influenced by perceptions clearly not 
 based on scientific (event(s) or object(s) that prove something). The scientific community has 
 come to a agreement, for example, that consumption of GM 
 foods presents/causes no health risks different from the consumption 
 of their ordinary partners (FAO, 2004). More than that, the 
 new GM maize varieties no longer use germ-killer markers, so 
 the changed plants cannot create resistance to germ-killing drugs 
 as is often perceived. The positive perceptions, on the other 
 hand, have scientific reason, but do not seem to influence WTP. Because this information is important for people 
 to participate effectively in the debate, there is a need for increased education on GM technology. Attention is needed to 
 communicate the effects of GM crops to people. Regular person surveys will better inform scientists and media 
 professionals about the perceptions (related to/looking at/thinking about) GM crops in the 
 country. 
 Given the experience of this survey, some methodological improvements can be suggested for future studies. For instance, 
 people might be asked to describe the reasons for their opinions or perceptions. We found that personal (features/ qualities/ traits), 
 as well as perceptions and attitudes, differ between (how money affects people's lives) groups, and that different groups buy their maize at different types of outlets. Therefore, household surveys, although 
 more expensive, would produce more representative results. This
