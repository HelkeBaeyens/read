 Abstract 
 This paper (asks lots of questions about/tries to find the truth about) patterns of soil (protecting something from harm) adoption among poor farmers in the Philippines. A model is presented that 
 focuses attention on the role of valuable things and consumption risk in influencing soil (protecting something from harm) adoption decisions. Results from a reduced-form 
 probit model of adoption are reported. These econometric findings point to/show that patterns of soil (protecting something from harm) adoption reflect relative risk 
 (things to carefully think about) in addition to farm and household (features/ qualities/ traits). Farm size, (length of time at work or in power/right to permanent employment) security, labor availability, and land quality all show a 
 strong connection with soil (protecting something from harm) adoption. In contrast, controlling on these and other household (features/ qualities/ traits), the chance of 
 adoption falls as consumption risk rises. These results highlight a need for greater sensitivity among policymakers to the role of 
 consumption risk in influencing soil (protecting something from harm) decisions in poor settings. Â© 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

 1. Introduction 
 Land worsening is an important money-based and 
 (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) policy problem in developing countries. To maintain farm incomes and reduce externalities connected with erosive farming-based ways of doing things, 
 a lot of work has been directed toward identifying and (helping increase/showing in a good way) money-making soil (protecting something from harm) plans in poor countries. 1 However, as many

 1 Some reviews of soil (protecting something from harm) practices are given by 
 Lutz et a!. (1994) and Sanders et a!. (1995). External effects are 
 not clearly treated here. For a general balance model of 
 farming-based externalities, see Coxhead and Slicely (1996). 
 
 (people who are watching something) now recognize, a money-making state is necessary 
 but rarely (good) enough to secure/make sure of soil (protecting something from harm) adoption (Barbier and Church supervisor, 1995; Ervin and Ervin, 
 1982; L6pez-Pereira et al., 1994). In poor 
 settings, where valuable thing holdings are modest and borrowing for eating/drinking is hard, money-based restrictions can be important (things that decide other things) of investment 
 patterns (Reardon and Vosti, 1995). The first (or most important) 
 statement/book of this paper is that the income risk connected 
 with soil (protecting something from harm) measures can discourage 
 adoption by useful thing/valuable supply-held back farmers. 
 To test this statement/book, this paper (asks lots of questions about/tries to find the truth about) the 
 (pertaining to each person or thing) roles of valuable things and relative risk in explaining patterns of outline hedgerow adoption in the 
 Philippines. Outline hedgerows are permanent (like a vegetable) (blocking things) planted across the width of a field and

 spaced 5-10 m apart. The (blocking things) restrict soil and 
 water movement, and improve nutrient recycling. 
 Once-a-year crops are planted in the areas between the 
 hedgerows. A first (or most important) advantage of hedgerows compared with other soil (protecting something from harm) measures such as 
 rock walls and terraces is their (compared to other things) low labor 
 and material cost for construction. However, an important (bad result or effect) with hedgerows is their opportunity cost and hit/effect on traditional farming-based practices. They occupy cultivable space and 5-7 years 
 may be needed/demanded before their yield-increasing properties make up for previous/unavoidable grain. (even though there is the existence of) being 
 money-making in the long run, the first consumption 
 loss can discourage adoption on small or useful thing/valuable supplypoor farms. 
 This paper is scientifically oriented. However, it 
 also tries to extend the (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) for studying 
 adoption decisions by presenting a model that focuses clearly stated/particular attention on the role of risk in conditioning adoption. 2 The paper (asks lots of questions about/tries to find the truth about) the scientific roles of valuable things and relative risk in explaining 
 patterns of hedgerow adoption. A reduced form 
 model is guessed using data from a sample of 
 Philippine farms. Econometric findings demonstrate 
 that patterns of soil (protecting something from harm) adoption reflect 
 relative risk (things to carefully think about) in addition to farm and 
 household (features/ qualities/ traits). Results highlight a need 
 for greater sensitivity among policymakers to the 
 role of consumption risk in influencing soil (protecting something from harm) decisions in poor settings. 
 
 2. Soil (protecting something from harm) adoption and risk 
 
 2.1. Model (detailed description of exactly what is required) 
 The possible result of consumption risk on 
 hedgerow adoption can be illustrated using a simplified model of an agriq.Iltural household. The house- 
 
 hold is assumed to (make as big as possible) its expected returns 
 from farming, (in other words),: 
 Max E[ 
 
 fj 17T1 (rt) 
 
 l 
 
 subject to the definition of farm income: 
 7T 1 
 
 ( 
 
 1) 
 
 3 
 
 =A[f(S,e,x,s) -c(e,x)]_) +wL+I 
 
 (2) 
 
 and a household-specific safety-first restriction: 
 Pr( 7T 1 &amp;lt;D)&#126; 
 
 a 
 
 'rft. 
 
 (3) 
 
 In Eq. (1), fj is a per-period discount factor; 7T1 is 
 per-period net farm income, and e = 0{,1} represents 
 the use of hedgerows. In Eq. (2), A represents farm 
 size; f(S,x,e,s) is a (random/including random data points) production function 
 that depends on the soil stock (S), conservation 
 effortS ( 8 ), other inputs (X), and a (random/including random data points) shock 
 ( s ); and c( e, x) is a cost function. Eq. (2) also 
 includes noncrop income which is the combination 
 of nonwage income (I) and labor ( L) supplied at the 
 wage rate ( w ). In Eq. (3), D is a dividing line or critical 
 level of income and a represents a maximum (OK to say or do) chance of falling below the dividing line. Bigman (1996) provides a review of safety-first judging requirements. 
 As pointed to/showed above, the benefits connected with 
 hedgerows appear with a delay. For example, if fo 
 represents production without soil (protecting something from harm) and / 1 
 represents production with soil (protecting something from harm), it may be 
 the case that fo &amp;gt; f 1 early in the planning (line in the distance where the Earth and sky meet) 
 and f 1 &amp;gt; fo in later years. An initial 'negative flow' 
 is typical for investments in soil (protecting something from harm), and 
 may be especially important to useful thing/valuable supply-held back farmers operating near their dividing line income level. 
 Including the safety-first restriction in the 
 farmer's problem means that the decision maker 
 must test expected returns in terms of a chance distribution for minimum income. This distribution will depend on the income-earning ability (to hold or do something) 
 of the household. Although restrictions could be used 
 to specify a closed form for the (may or may not happen, depending on something) chance distribution of returns, a more general approach is 
 to re-express the safety-first restriction as: 
 1r1(8) 
 
 2 In this study, adoption is framed as a binary choice. For an 
 analysis of two-stage adoption decisions (i.e., a yesjno decision 
 followed by an land decision) see Lohr and Park (1995).

 3 Best control models based on Eqs. (1) and (2) are usually (made as big as possible) subject to an equation of movement for the soil 
 stock (e.g., Barbier, 1988; Barrett, 1991; LaFrance, 1992). 
 
 G.E. Slicely/ Farming-based Money flow 17 ( 1997) 165-177 
 
 where F- 1 (a) aw is the inverse of the distribution 
 function of returns and aw is a measure of spread 
 (Boussard, 1979). 
 (biggest increase/best possible extent) of Eq. (1) subject to Eqs. (2) and 
 (3') leads to an best where in each period

 Eq. (5) is a not important benefit-not important cost condition for adoption that clearly accounts for the cost 
 of adoption in terms of its hit/effect on the safety-first 
 restriction in each period. If this restriction is binding 
 (i.e., if A&amp;gt; 0), adoption decisions will not be based 
 only on a comparison of net benefit flows between 
 ways of doing things, but will also depend on farm size, nonfarm income, and the hit/effect of adoption on the 
 chance of consumption shortfall. 
 
 2.2. The adoption decision 
 Inverting Eq. (5) leads to a demand function for 
 soil (protecting something from harm) investments of the form: 
 
 (6) 
 Eq. (6) says that the decision (related to/looking at/thinking about) soil (protecting something from harm) adoption will depend on farm size, the cost 
 of adoption, and the shape of the expected chance distribution connected with the safety-first restriction. The chance distribution is conditioned on 
 the income-earning ability (to hold or do something) of the household. Given 
 the (related to the study of how likely or unlikely things are to happen) nature of the safety-first restriction, 
 expectations will clearly influence adoption decisions. What's more, by influencing technology performance or adoption cost, farm-clearly stated/particular attributes 
 such as land quality or slope may also influence 
 adoption decisions. Including the safety-first restriction in the adoption problem highlights the point 
 that when technology adoption is expensive, it has the 
 possible ability to  push a lo&#126;-income hdusehold below its 
 disaster level. One would therefore expect adoption 
 decisions to be influenced by (and explained by) the 
 productive ability (to hold or do something) of the household. Eq. (6) therefore serves as the basis for the reduced-form scientific model (examined closely) below.

 3. Sample description 
 
 3.1. Description of data and study site 
 Data used to guess the model are drawn from a 
 1994-1995 farm survey of 115 com producers in an 
 upland area near Bansalan, in the Philippine area of control/area of land 
 of Davao del Sur. The site is described in Garcia et 
 al. (1995). Farms are located at elevations of 10001500 m above sea level. A majority of sample farms 
 lie at or above 18% slope, and once-a-year rates of soil 
 wearing away in the area have been guessed at 100 tjha 
 (Latada et al., 1994). The combination of land worsening, small farm sizes ( &amp;lt; 3 ha), low yields (1350 
 kgjha), and poors (US$600 per household) 
 means that many families in the area cannot reliably 
 maintain household food security. 
 
 3.2. Farm (features/ qualities/ traits) and the opportunity cost of 
 soil conservation 
 Guesses of the labor and opportunity costs of 
 hedgerow construction are summarized in Table 1. 
 The consumption risk included in soil conservation 
 adoption is directly related to the opportunity cost of 
 hedgerows. This opportunity cost can be calculated 
 in terms of the previous/unavoidable grain connected with the 
 area occupied by hedgerows. The guess of opportunity cost for each parcel is based on recommended 
 hedgerow spacing for watched/followed field slope, and was 
 converted to a grain-equal measure using the 
 sample average yield. The opportunity cost of adoption on a parcel is measured as a ratio. The numerator is the total amount of amount of grain that would 
 have been previous/unavoidable if hedgerows had been built at the recommended strength on the parcel; 
 the denominator is the total household com harvest 
 of the previous year. Based on extension guesses, 
 lab&#126;r needed/demanded for establishment was assumed to be 
 40 -days /ha. This-' value was converted to grain 
 equals using the local farming-based wage (50 
 pesos/ day) and the winning/most common wholesale market price 
 of com (5 pesos/kg). 
 The entries in Table 1 suggest that per-hectare 
 labor needed things for hedgerow adoption were rather

 low, usually on the order of 4-7% of available 
 household labor. (in the opposite way), the opportunity cost of 
 land used for hedgerows was quite high, especially 
 for small farms on steep fields (where greater 
 hedgerow strength must reduce wearing away). As 
 the entries in Table 1 point to/show, in the first years of 
 adoption the total amount of amount of grain previous/unavoidable 
 due to hedgerow construction on a parcel was about 
 80% of the once-a-year available supply for a household 
 in the lowest farm-size quintile, and about 15% for a 
 household in the highest farm-size quintile. These 
 high measures of opportunity cost reflect three facts. 
 First, the output gap between traditional and 
 hedgerow plots can be as much as 25% of output 
 during the first years of hedgerow establishment. 
 Second, it usually takes 5-7 years for the yield 
 increasing properties of hedgerows to erase this 
 gap. And third, small farms usually depend on a single 
 parcel of land to meet food production needs while 
 large farms spread production over a few parcels. 
 The opportunity cost of adopting hedgerows on any 
 single parcel therefore tends to be higher on small 
 farms than on large farms. The overall cost (in terms 
 of labor, land, and materials) of beginning and building on 
 hedgerows ranged from 16 to 55% of total once-a-year 
 income on average. At the time of the survey, 60% 
 of sample farmers had adopted outline hedgerows 
 on one or more parcels. 
 3.3. Farm (features/ qualities/ traits) 
 Table 2 reports average values watched/followed for (numbers that change/things that change) thought about/believed in this analysis. The first three 
 columns in Table 2 go along with/match up to values for the full 
 household sample of adopters and non-adopters; the 
 last three columns go along with/match up to a subsample of 
 plots (both with and without hedgerows) for which 
 described/explained plot-level information was available. 4 (things that you control (like study times), that cause other things to change (like test scores)) are presented in four groups: (A) 
 valuable things; (B) off-farm income; (C) farmer (features/ qualities/ traits); and (D) plot (features/ qualities/ traits). 
 
 4 Plot-level data are a subset of the farm-level data and contain 
 a larger proportion of second-season harvests. Farmers who planted 
 com during the second cropping season had larger farms, more 
 non-farming-based income, and higher first-season yields than their 
 groups of people.

 3.3.1. Valuable things 
 Valuable things thought about/believed in this study include farm size, 
 (length of time at work or in power/right to permanent employment) security, and labor amount and quality. As a 
 factor of production and store of wealth, land is 
 probably the most important valuable thing influencing adoption. Land provides money and is one of the few 
 sources of credit and liquidity for poor families. For these reasons, one might expect a household's desire or ability to invest in soil (protecting something from harm) to be positively related to farm size. 
 For example, models of technology adoption that 
 clearly account for farm size and risk (describe the future) 
 higher adoption rates on large farms (Feder and 
 O'Mara, 1981; Just and Zilberman, 1983; Feder et 
 al., 1985). (in almost the same way), scientific studies from LDCs 
 have pointed to/showed that agroforestry adoption rates are 
 higher on large farms (Scherr, 1995), and that farmers regard small farm size as a (blocking thing) to investing in 
 soil (protection of natural things/using less energy, water, etc.) (Fujisaka, 1993). 5 In the (moving backwards), farm size is expressed as area per adult-equal unit. 
 Land ownership is also likely to be an important 
 (thing that decides something) of adoption. (length of time at work or in power/right to permanent employment) security can influence access to credit, the length of a household's 
 planning (line in the distance where the Earth and sky meet), or a household's desire to 
 invest. Although investments in soil conservation 
 have been found to be lower on rented land than 
 owned land (e.g., Clay and Reardon, 1994), confusing statement can sometimes arise (related to/looking at/thinking about) the role of (length of time at work or in power/right to permanent employment) 
 security in influencing adoption. For example, while 
 (length of time at work or in power/right to permanent employment) security may be a (something that must exist before something else can happen) for investments in maintaining land working well, in some 
 settings investments may help farmers to get de 
 facto if not (based on the law) land rights (Russell, 1986). This 
 logic applies a little bit in the study area for this 
 (act of asking questions and trying to find the truth about something). Most farms lie within Mt. Apo National Park on what is legally classified as public 
 land. Although this might be viewed as a situation of 
 (length of time at work or in power/right to permanent employment) (state of not being safe/source of mental worry), farmers covered by traditional 
 (length of time at work or in power/right to permanent employment) governments anyway see farming-based investments as a way to (make legal/make acceptable) their claim to the land, 
 and local people in charge terfc:l to officially recognize tra- 
 
 5 However, as a reviewer has pointed out, a large farm size may 
 also allow longer rotations, which could reduce retums from 
 conservation and interfere with (rewards or reasons for doing something) for soil (protecting something from harm) investments.

 ditional -forms of (length of time at work or in power/right to permanent employment) when good land-use practices are watched/followed. For this reason, both traditional 
 land claims and titled ownership are classified as 
 secure (length of time at work or in power/right to permanent employment) in this study. Rented land is classified 
 as insecure (length of time at work or in power/right to permanent employment). By this definition, about 
 75% of sample farms had secure (length of time at work or in power/right to permanent employment) at the time 
 of the survey. 
 Labor needed things are well-known as a important element influencing adoption of soil conservation 
 (Fujisaka, 1993; Harper and El-Swaify, 1988; Clay 
 and Reardon, 1994). Measures of both labor amount 
 and labor quality are included in this study. Families had an average of two adult-male equal 
 workers and average labor ability (to hold or do something) of about 
 500 days per year. In the (moving backwards), labor availability is measured as man days per hectare. Land 
 quality is measured as educational accomplishment (in 
 years) among household heads. 
 3.3.2. Off-farm income 
 Results from previous studies suggest an confusing role for off-farm income in influencing soil 
 conservation adoption. A negative relationship may 
 reflect labor competition between off-farm activities 
 and farming, or may signal a move/change in household 
 interests away from farming as a first (or most important) job. 
 For example, in a previous study of soil conservation 
 adoption in the Philippines, de los Angeles (1986) 
 reported a negative relationship between the level of 
 non-farm income in a household, and the chance 
 of (protecting something from harm) adoption, and decided that families without off-farm income had greater (rewards or reasons for doing something) 
 to maintain on-farm useful things/valuable supplies. In contrast, other 
 authors have argued that off-farm income provides 
 cash for investments in (protection of natural things/using less energy, water, etc.), especially when 
 labor or materials must be gotten (e.g., Reardon 
 and Vosti, 1995). Two off-farm income (numbers that change/things that change) are 
 used in this analysis. The first measures non-farming-based, nonwage income. The second measures wage 
 income. In both cases, the (number or thing that changes) entered in the 
 (moving backwards) is expressed in pesos per adult-equal 
 unit. 
 3.3.3. Farmer (features/ qualities/ traits) 
 Farmer (features/ qualities/ traits) incorporated in the analysis 
 include an indicator of religious preference, a measure of attitudes toward hedgerows, and a (not definite) 
 
 171 
 
 guess of hedgerow yields. About 30% of 
 farmers in the sample reported membership in the 
 local Baptist church, a factor that is important for 
 this study because of a church-based extension program that (helped increase/showed in a good way) hedgerows in the area. An attitude measure is included because previous studies 
 have shown that farmer attitudes are important (things that decide other things) of new technology adoption (e.g., Adesina 
 and Zinnah, 1993). An index of a decision maker's 
 attitude toward hedgerows is used. This index was 
 built using responses from a series of 10 
 questions (related to/looking at/thinking about) positive and negative parts of 
 hedgerows. For each question a negative response 
 was recorded as -1, a positive response was 
 recorded as + 1, and (not caring) was recorded as 0. 
 The index, figured out/calculated as the sum across the 10 
 questions, was centered and scaled so that it is 
 positive for decision makers who judge hedgerows 
 more positively/well than average, and is negative for 
 decision makers who judge hedgerows less positively/well 
 than average. The (moving backwards) also include a measure 
 of a farmer's guess of the hit/effect of hedgerows on 
 corn yields. Construction of this (not definite) yield 
 guess is described in Add on A. The (number or thing that changes) is 
 a ratio figured out/calculated as the farmer's yield guess for a 
 hedgerow plot divided by his yield guess for a 
 traditional plot. As built, this ratio goes beyond 1 
 for farmers who think about/believe hedgerows superior to 
 traditional methods of growing corn, falls below 1 
 for farmers who think about/believe hedgerows (compared to other things) inferior to traditional ways of doing things, and equals 1 for farmers who regard yields under the two ways of doing things as 
 mostly almost the same. On average, both adopters and 
 non-adopters judged hedgerows as (compared to other things) more 
 productive than traditional ways of doing things. 
 
 3.3.4. Plot (features/ qualities/ traits) 
 Plot (features/ qualities/ traits) used in the analysis include 
 parcel size, measures of land quality, and an guess 
 of the opportunity cost of adoption. Two (numbers that change/things that change) 
 represent land quality: soil depth and length of time of use. 
 Soil depth on each parcel was credited using data 
 from a recent soil survey. The length of time of use (number or thing that changes) is measured in months and was figured out/calculated as the 
 total length of time since the parcel was first cropped, 
 minus any (in-between/helping) periods of unplanted. Both (features/ qualities/ traits) could be expected to influence adoption 
 
 172 
 
 G. E. Slicely/ Farming-based Money flow 17 ( 1997) 165-177 
 
 because returns to soil (protecting something from harm) can be lower on 
 insulted/got worse land. Parcel slope is also included in the 
 analysis under the idea (you think is true) that greater slope increases the cost of hedgerow adoption. As the entries 
 in Table 1 point to/show, small farms tend to occupy 
 steeper land, a pattern that would suggest in a planned way higher costs of adoption on small farms. 
 Finally, in order to test whether the fixed cost 
 of adopting hedgerows on a particular plot might 
 add/give to overall consumption risk in a household, a measure of the opportunity cost of adoption 
 is employed. This (number or thing that changes) is measured as a ratio. 
 The numerator is the total amount of amount of forgone 
 grain connected with hedgerow construction on the 
 parcel. The denominator is the total once-a-year com 
 harvest for the household from all parcels. 6 A small 
 value points to/shows that adoption would have reduced the 
 household com supply by a small proportion. A large 
 value points to/shows that adoption would have needed/demanded a 
 farm to give up/forget about  an amount of grain that was a (compared to other things) large proportion of its typical com harvest. 
 
 4. Model guess and results 
 A reduced-form model was used to relate 
 hedgerow adoption to (numbers that change/things that change) organized and listed in Section 3. 
 Analysis was conducted at both the farm level and 
 the plot level. In the farm-level (moving backwards), adoption 
 is registered as a binary (number or thing that changes) equal to 1 if the 
 household adopted outline hedgerows anywhere on 
 the farm, and 0 otherwise. In the plot-level (moving backwards), adoption is registered as a binary (number or thing that changes) 
 equal to 1 if the household adopted outline 
 hedgerows on a clearly stated/particular plot and 0 otherwise. A 
 probit model was used under the ideas (you think are true) that an 
 hidden (under) (but unseen) response (number or thing that changes) describes a household's chance of technology 
 
 6 This ratio generally increases as farm size falls, although it 
 need not, since a large plot on a large farm may have a larger ratio 
 than a small plot on a small farm. The denominator of this 
 measure is an endogenous function of the adoption decision, but 
 the bias introduced in the (moving backwards) is in favor of a positive 
 coefficient on the move backwardor. Given the large and (related to numbers) 
 strong negative sign on the guessed coefficient, this (related to studying numbers) 
 bias is not of great concern. 
 
 adoption, and that unseen disturbances are (usually/ in a common and regular way) distributed. 7 
 Table 3 contains results from four probit (moving backwards). (moving backwards) A1 and A2 were conducted at the 
 farm level; (moving backwards) B1 and B2 were conducted at 
 the plot level. All (moving backwards) contain measures of 
 valuable things and off-farm income. Model A2 adds to model 
 A1 the set of farmer-clearly stated/particular (numbers that change/things that change). Model B2 
 contains both farmer-clearly stated/particular (numbers that change/things that change) and plotspecific (numbers that change/things that change). The farm-level dataset contains 
 115 (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements); the plot-level dataset contains 89 
 (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements). Overall, the models (describe the future) farm-level 
 adoption patterns somewhat better than plot-level 
 adoption patterns, reaching an 86% success rate in 
 model A2. 
 
 4.1. Valuable things 
 Results from all reported models point to/show that 
 after controlling other factors, hedgerow adoption 
 was more likely on large farms. These results are 
 agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with previous Philippine research on soil 
 conservation adoption (de los Angeles, 1986). Results suggest that farm size may be a substitute for lower 
 risk exposure, fewer liquidity restrictions, or improved access to useful things/valuable supplies. In ability to stretch terms, a 1% 
 increase in per person farm size is related to a 
 0.15% increase in the chance of adoption at the 
 mean. In the farm-level (moving backwards) (models A1 and 
 A2), the chance of adoption is positively and 
 significantly related to the proportion of a 
 household's holdings that are securely held (either 
 formally or informally). This relationship is somewhat weaker in the plot level (moving backwards) (models B 1 
 and B2). In contrast, in the farm-level (moving backwards) 
 (models A1 and A2) the relationship between labor 
 availability and adoption is weak in the farm-level 
 (moving backwards), but per hectare labor availability is positively related to hedgerow adoption at a 95% 
 confidence level in the plot-level (moving backwards). Education of the household head shows a positive but 
 (related to numbers) weak relationship with adoption in all 
 models. The (related to studying numbers) weakness likely reflects the 
 
 7 The results of the pro bit models do not differ very (much) from 
 those of logit models (in which disturbances are assumed to be 
 log-(usually/ in a common and regular way) distributed).

 fact that educational accomplishments in the sample were 
 completely low. 
 4.2. Off-farm income 
 Including measures of off-farm income presents 
 an econometric challenge because decisions (related to/looking at/thinking about) soil (protecting something from harm) investments and off-farm labor 
 supply are often (at the same time) decided/figured out. The 
 possible endogeneity of off-farm income is a feature 
 that complicates efforts to include measures of offfarm income in any adoption study. Here, the null 
 guess that off-farm income is (coming from the outside of something) to 
 adoption is tested, rather than assumed. The testing 
 method follows the procedure of Smith and Blundell 
 ( 1986) for testing exogeneity in a Tobit moving backward. 
 Formally, the procedure consists of testing whether 
 c = 0 in the moving backward y =ax+ bm + cv + c:, where 
 y is the adoption (number or thing that changes), m is the off-farm income 
 (number or thing that changes), and v is the (described the future) leftover/extra from a 
 moving backward of m on a set of instrumental (numbers that change/things that change). 
 For this study, tests were managed and did/done on both measures of off-farm income. Results suggest that only 
 the measure of per person wages strictly fails the test 
 of exogeneity. 8 Anyway, given the likely endogeneity of both measures of off-farm income, each 
 has been replaced by its instrumented value. The 
 (moving backwards) used for figuring out/calculating (tools or objects used to do work or measure something) are reported in Add on B. 
 Moving backward results point to/show that neither off-farm 
 income (number or thing that changes) is related to adoption at standard importance levels. Anyway, the patterns 
 showed in the (moving backwards) help to explain previous 
 disagreements in scientific findings in two ways. 
 First, the chance of adoption is negatively related to non-farming-based, non-wage income. This 
 may reflect reduced interest in farming among 
 families with non-farming-based income, some of 
 whom had started small businesses that competed 
 with farming for money-givings. Second, families with wage income appear to have invested in 
 hedgerows at a higher rate than those without. Far 
 
 8 Specific t-statistics for the tests are as follows: for per person 
 non-farming-based, non-wage income: t = 1.31, and for per person 
 wage income: t = 2.11. 
 
 from pointing to/showing a habit/desire to invest wage earnings 
 in soil (protecting something from harm), however, this more likely represents a greater reliance on once-a-year crop income by 
 wage earners, who tended to have below-average 
 incomes. 
 4.3. Farmer (features/ qualities/ traits) 
 Membership in the local Baptist church and participation in farming-based training workshops run by 
 the church are highly related in the sample. Not 
 surprisingly, therefore, data point to/show that families 
 identified as Baptist tended to adopt hedgerows at a 
 higher rate than their non-Baptist groups of people. Model A2 
 points to/shows that hedgerow adopters generally show a 
 more good (point of view/way of behaving) toward hedgerows than nonadopters. While such a pattern might not itself be 
 surprising, what is surprising is that adding this 
 (not definite) measure does not reduce the explanatory power of farm-level (features/ qualities/ traits). Model A2 
 also includes farmer guesses of the hit/effect of 
 hedgerows on yields. On average, both adopters and 
 non-adopters judged hedgerows as (compared to other things) more 
 productive than traditional ways of doing things. However, moving backward results point to/show that adopters were likely to 
 judge them less positively/well than non-adopters. This 
 pattern is unexpected, but may point to/show that adopters 
 were more correct in their guess of hits/effects than 
 non-adopters (since lower com output was watched/followed 
 on hedgerow plots). 
 4.4. Plot (features/ qualities/ traits) 
 The results of the plot-level (moving backwards) point to/show 
 that adoption was less likely on large parcels than on 
 small parcels (model B2). This pattern is consistent 
 with research from Africa that shows large farms 
 tend to invest less per hectare in soil conservation 
 than small farms (e.g., Clay and Reardon, 1994). 
 However, (things causing other things to happen) could run the other way as well: 
 if parcels are large because soil quality is poor, then 
 the returns to soil (protecting something from harm) investments on large 
 parcels might be low, and therefore (rewards or reasons for doing something) to 
 adopt may be weaker than on smaller parcels. 
 The guessed coefficients on the land quality 
 (numbers that change/things that change) are negative and very different from 
 
 G.E. Slicely/ Farming-based Money flow 17 (1997) 165-177 
 
 zero at a 95% confidence level. Parcels with greater 
 soil depth were less likely to receive investments in 
 soil (protecting something from harm), and older parcels were also less 
 likely to receive investments. Since older parcels are 
 likely to have experienced greater total soil 
 loss, these results suggest a (not going in a straight line) hit/effect of land 
 quality on adoption. Farmers may delay (protection of natural things/using less energy, water, etc.) on parcels that have remaining productive 
 (possible greatness or power), but stop investing on parcels that 
 are very old and, probably, exhausted. Although a 
 idea-based link between parcel slope and cost of 
 adoption is clear, this explanation for lower adoption 
 rates on small farms is not fully carried out by the 
 data. In the (moving backwards), greater slope is negatively 
 related to adoption, but not at (meaningful numbers) levels. 
 Finally, to test whether the opportunity cost of 
 adopting hedgerows on a particular plot discouraged 
 adoption, a measure of the opportunity cost of adoption is included in model B2. The guessed coefficient is negative and very different from zero 
 at a 95% confidence level. This pattern points to/shows that 
 as the opportunity cost of adoption on a plot rises, 
 the chance of adoption falls. Greater consumption risk, as reflected by a higher opportunity cost of 
 soil (protecting something from harm) adoption on a plot, appears to be 
 negatively related to the chance of adopting 
 hedgerows. 9 
 
 5. Ends/end results 
 
 This paper examined the (pertaining to each person or thing) roles of farm 
 (features/ qualities/ traits) and relative risk in explaining patterns 
 of soil (protecting something from harm) adoption by a group of poor farmers in the Philippines. A idea-based model 
 based on a safety-first judging requirement was presented. The 
 model highlighted the importance of consumption 
 
 9 As a reviewer pointed out, a change in opportunity cost could 
 shift the distribution of (money made/good things received) and in that way lead to a change in the 
 level of production risk. Therefore, sometimes the (substitute-related) 
 measure of consumption risk used in the (moving backwards) could also be 
 picking-up the hit/effect of higher production risk on adoption. 
 Obviously, an increase in either production risk or consumption 
 risk could discourage adoption.

 risk in influencing adoption decisions. A reducedform model of hedgerow adoption was guessed 
 using probit analysis. Among the scientific findings 
 watched/followed were that land- and labor-poor families 
 are less likely to invest in soil (protecting something from harm). Larger 
 farm size, greater (length of time at work or in power/right to permanent employment) security, and higher labor 
 availability were all related to higher chance of adoption on sample farms. Higher adoption 
 chance was also positively related to wage 
 income, but was negatively related to other 
 forms of off-farm income. 
 Factors that helped explain patterns of adoption at 
 the plot level include land quality and risk exposure. 
 Adoption was seen to be less likely when land 
 quality was high, or when plots were old. In the case 
 of risk exposure, results supported the main guess tested in the paper, namely that after controlling 
 valuable thing holdings, household (features/ qualities/ traits), and (not definite) factors, consumption risk influences (protection of natural things/using less energy, water, etc.) adoption. As the consumption risk (designed only for/happening only within) 
 adoption increased, as measured here by the opportunity cost of (protection of natural things/using less energy, water, etc.) adoption on a plot, the 
 chance of adoption fell. 
 Focusing on the change in (described the future) chance of 
 hedgerow adoption connected with changes in available labor and land, the results show that individually, labor is (compared to other things) less important than land. This 
 pattern is agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with the modest labor needed things for hedgerow establishment (e.g., 40 daysjha 
 compared with up to 500 days jha for bench terraces). In contrast, per person farm size was positively and significantly related to the chance of adoption. Larger farms, of course, have both 
 greater productive ability (to hold or do something) and greater liquidity, both 
 of which translate into lower consumption risk. 
 From a policy (way of seeing things / sensible view of what is and is not important), these patterns highlight the importance of risk management in (helping increase/showing in a good way) soil (protecting something from harm) technologies to useful thing/valuable supply-held back farmers. Future work should focus on three 
 related areas of research: first, (asking lots of questions about/trying to find the truth about) the extent to which risk (things to carefully think about) influence soil (protecting something from harm) decisions in other settings; second, testing the degree to which specific soil conservation 
 plans influence consumption risk; and third, separating the hit/effect of adoption on consumption risk 
 from the possible hit/effect of adoption on production 
 risk. A better understanding of these factors will 
 likely add/give to efforts directed at the twin goals

 A two-moment analysis was used to bring out (not definite) yield distributions based on the relative ease 
 with which a triangular distribution could be done scientifically (Anderson et al., 1977; Pingali, 
 1982). During the survey, each decision maker was 
 asked to guess the most likely (m), lowest (a), and 
 highest (b) corn harvest he thought possible, with 
 and without soil (protecting something from harm), on a clearly stated/particular parcel of 
 land. Parcels used for the guesses were (after that) measured, and the person's yield guesses were figured out/calculated for lowest value, modal, and 
 maximum values under both pictures/situations. Chance 
 density functions were then guessed as:

 Farmers tended to provide higher guesses for 
 mean produces and variances with hedgerows than 
 without hedgerows. Paired comparison tests between 
 adopters and non-adopters point to/show that the difference between true and (not definite) guesses of means 
 were (a) little higher for adopters and that the difference between true and (not definite) guesses of variances did not differ across farmer groups. This hints that adopters tend to be somewhat more hopeful (related to/looking at/thinking about) hedgerows than non-adopters. An 
 different (understanding/ explanation) is that the measure serves 
 as a substitute for farmer skill: better farmers might have 
 a lower guess error; because of this, a ratio closer to the 
 true value, in this case, a about 0.90.
