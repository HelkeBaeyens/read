 ABSTRACT 
 Applied econometric analyses of market (combination of different things together that work as one unit) based on price data alone have been criticised, because 
 they neglect the role of transaction costs. To meet this objection dividing line vector error correction models are 
 used. Dividing line models can account for the effects of transaction costs in price transmission without directly 
 relying upon information about these costs, which are often unavailable. Results from dividing line models that 
 are based on two dividing lines provide results that are (money-based)/cheaply more (intelligent/obvious) than those received/got from 
 one dividing line models. However there is no (good) enough econometric test for dividing line importance in a twothreshold model available so far; such tests are only available for the one dividing line model. In this paper a 
 restricted two-dividing line model is developed in which the importance of the dividing lines can be tested. This 
 model is therefore agreeable to money-based (understanding/ explanation) and (related to studying numbers) guessing. This model is used to 
 guess market (combination of different things together that work as one unit) on the (related to Europe) pig market.

 INTRODUCTION 
 Econometric analyses of market (combination of different things together that work as one unit) are becoming more and more popular. Farmers as well as 
 farming-based money-flow experts are interested to what extent price shocks are transmitted between markets. For 
 example, German pig producers use the valuable thing exchange AEX in Amsterdam for hedging the price risk, 
 assuming that German and Dutch markets are highly (having different things working together as one unit). Money-flow experts often use market (combination of different things together that work as one unit), 
 defined as the degree of price transmission between two either (up and down) or (related to space or existing in space)ly related markets, as a 
 substitute for market (wasting very little while working or producing something). To answer questions about market (combination of different things together that work as one unit), (good) enough scientific methods are 
 necessary. Especially over the last few years, these methods have improved much. Anyway there is still 
 no brought together (as one) approach to test market integration2. Recent studies that depend on price data alone have been 
 criticised by Barrett for their neglecting of transaction costs (Barrett 2001; Barrett &amp; Li 2002). Due to 
 commonly unavailable information on transaction costs, we therefore propose an approach of measuring 
 market (combination of different things together that work as one unit) based on price data alone but also (thinking about/when one thinks about) effects of transaction costs. Unlike most 
 studies that analyse price (change to make better/related to changing something) between up-and-down related stages of the marketing chain we focus on 
 (related to space or existing in space) market (combination of different things together that work as one unit). Because of this our analysis is related to the books on the "Law of one price" (Lo &amp; 
 Zivot 2001; Obstfeld &amp; Taylor 1997). To number the price (change to make better/related to changing something) we use the (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) of a vector 
 error correction model (VECM). As an extension and invention of new things we also take testable dividing line effects into 
 account. To illustrate this approach we analyse market (combination of different things together that work as one unit) between pig markets in Germany and the 
 Netherlands. 
 In the following section of the paper we describe the scientific method. In section 3 the results of our 
 scientific application to German/Dutch pork markets are presented. In section 4 ends/end results are drawn and 
 suggestions for further research are given.

 THRESHOLD VECTOR ERROR CORRECTION MODEL 
 Price series of farming-based valuable things are often non-unmoving. Therefore guessing price (change to make better/related to changing something) as 
 the hit/effect of a change in one price on another price should be based on appropriate methods which allow for 
 non-unmoving (numbers that change/things that change). In market (combination of different things together that work as one unit) models, the error correction model (ECM) (detailed description of exactly what is required) has 
 gained (quality of being liked a lot or done a lot) because of its obviously appealing (understanding/ explanation). For example, v. Cramon-Taubadel 
 (1998) analyses up-and-down price transmission between farm gate and wholesale pig prices in Germany using an 
 ECM. To incorporate also produces of transaction costs into models of price transmission, dividing line error 
 correction models (TECM) have been developed. Based on work by Balke and Fomby (1997) many studies 
 have been done/tried so far. Obstfeld and Taylor (1997) for example analyse the "Law of one Price" within 
 such (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built). Goodwin and Piggott use a dividing line error correction model to number (related to space or existing in space) integration 
 in US corn and soybeans markets (Goodwin &amp; Piggott 2001). Ben-Kaabia, Gil et al. (2002) estimate price 
 transmission between (up and down) related stages of the Spanish lamb market using a dividing line model. In the 
 following we describe the idea  of our analysis dealing with (problems, delays, etc.) (related to/looking at/thinking about) the money-based 
 (understanding/ explanation) of the (change to make better/related to changing something) process and the econometric testability of dividing line limits/guidelines. These issues 
 have been often ignored in the books. 
 On (related to space or existing in space)ly (having different things working together as one unit) markets such as Germany and the Netherlands, where it is not (based on what's seen or what seems obvious) clear which 
 price causes the other, the use of an vector error correction model (VECM) is appropriate. A (detailed description of exactly what is required) of 
 a VECM is given is the following equation:

 with ap t = p t a' p t a'1 . Here changes in the Dutch as well as changes in the German pig price are 
 (at the same time) explained by constant terms ( Î±1, 2 ), fell behind (for only a short time) reactions to previous changes in the 
 Dutch and the German pig price ( ap t a'i ) and by mistakes from the long-term balance represented ECT. 
 If a VECM such as (1) is used to guess price (change to make better/related to changing something) one understood idea (you think is true) has to be noted. 
 (change to make better/related to changing something) of prices caused by mistakes from the long-term balance (ECT) are assumed to be 
 continuous and a linear function of the importance of the moving away from long-term balance. So even very 
 small mistakes from the long-term balance will always lead to an (change to make better/related to changing something) process on each market.3 
 This idea (you think is true) might lead to a (created unfair thinking in)/(unfair-thinking) result, because it ignores the hit/effect of transaction costs. In (related to space or existing in space) 
 markets, transportation costs will limit the transmission of price shocks below a critical level because 
 possible gains from trade cannot outweigh these costs and because of this a perfect price (change to make better/related to changing something) will not happen.4 
 Therefore in the case of significant transaction costs (change to make better/related to changing something) to the long-term balance should not be 
 continuous. 
 Taking these effects/results/suggestions of transaction costs into the process of carefully thinking about something provides a reason for the use of 
 models with price (change to make better/related to changing something) including dividing lines, with the error-correction term (ECT) as the dividing line 
 (number or thing that changes).5 Within such models, the extent to which mistakes from balance are responsible for a price 
 (change to make better/related to changing something) depends on the importance of these mistakes. The price (change to make better/related to changing something) process may be different if 
 mistakes are above or below a clearly stated/particular dividing line. 
 In figure 1, price (change to make better/related to changing something) ( ap t ), as a function of mistakes from the long-term balance (ECT), is 
 represented by a) a linear error-correction model (ECM), b) a one dividing line error-correction model (TECM) 
 and c) a two dividing line error-correction model (TECM). Because of its (interrupted/not touching) nature the TECM is 
 often labelled as "non-linear".

 Figure 1. Hit/effect of the error correction term on the price (change to make better/related to changing something). 
 Based on the number of dividing lines (c) the model contains c+1 different governments of price (change to make better/related to changing something). Studies 
 on price transmission using dividing line error correction models have either used one dividing line (c0) to separate 
 the (change to make better/related to changing something) process into two governments (Balke &amp; Fomby 1997; Enders &amp; Granger 1998; Abdulai 2002; 
 Ben-Kaabia, Gil et al. 2002) or two dividing lines (c1 and c2) to separate the (change to make better/related to changing something) process into three 
 governments6 (Obstfeld &amp; Taylor 1997; Goodwin &amp; Piggott 2001; Serra &amp; Goodwin 2002). We suggest that a 
 price (change to make better/related to changing something) model with three governments separated by two dividing lines7 can make more money-based sense than 
 a two-government model with only one dividing line. The band between the two dividing lines, which are below and 
 above the long-term balance, can be understood/explained as those mistakes from the long-term balance 
 which are, compared to (change to make better/related to changing something) costs, so small that they will not lead to a long-term (change to make better/related to changing something) process 
 of related prices. Results from a TECM with only one dividing line cannot be understood/explained in such an obviously 
 appealing way. 
 The advantage of easy understand/explainable results from a two-dividing line error correction model is unfortunately 
 weakened by the fact that so far no (good) enough econometric test for the importance of two dividing lines has been 
 developed (Hansen &amp; Seo 2001). To overcome this problem, we use a version of a one dividing line vector error 
 correction model (TVECM) proposed by Hansen and Seo (2001):

 Like the VECM (1) this one dividing line model explains the price changes by (for only a short time) as well as long-term 
 (change to make better/related to changing something), but also (may or may not happen, depending on something) on the moving away from the long-term balance. If the moving away from the 
 long-term balance is greater than the dividing line Î³, the price transmission process is defined by a different 
 government (government 2) than in the case of smaller mistakes from the long-term balance (government 1).

 Price (change to make better/related to changing something) defined by those long-term mistakes between c1 and c2 must not necessarily equal to zero.

 The difference between (2) and (3) is the government definition. In (detailed description of exactly what is required) (2) one price (change to make better/related to changing something) process 
 applies if the mistakes from the long-term balance are below a dividing line (government 1) and another applies 
 if the mistakes are above a dividing line (government 2)8. This (detailed description of exactly what is required) leaves out/keeps out the possibility of a "band of 
 non-(change to make better/related to changing something)"9 of smaller mistakes from a long-term balance inside a government of (change to make better/related to changing something) to bigger 
 mistakes (figure 2). (detailed description of exactly what is required) (3) allows this and is therefore (money-based)/cheaply more meaningful. Using 
 TVECM (3) we assume one government of price (change to make better/related to changing something) defined by total mistakes from the long-term 
 balance that are below the dividing line Î³ (government 1) and another defined by mistakes that go beyond the 
 dividing line Î³ in (value of a number, ignoring its sign)s (government 2). Because of this government definition we produce a TVECM that is based 
 on only one dividing line (Î³) and therefore is testable (related to/looking at/thinking about) dividing line importance, but that also possibly 
 allows for the (money-based)/cheaply meaningful "band of non-(change to make better/related to changing something)" (government 1) inside a government of price 
 (change to make better/related to changing something) to greater mistakes from the long-term balance (government 2). Note that TVECM (3) is 
 mostly a restricted version of the general two dividing line model showed in figure 1; restricted in the sense 
 that c1 = c 2 = Î³ in (3) and in the sense that no not mirror-images price transmission is possible in (3) as the same 
 price reaction happens (without any concern about/having nothing to do with) whether ECTt-1.is larger than Î³ or smaller than -Î³. The simple linear ECM 
 in figure 1, in turn, is a restricted form of (3) in which Î³=0.

 Figure 2. Hit/effect of the error correction term on the price (change to make better/related to changing something). 
 We propose a three-step procedure to guess the restricted TVECM (3). In a first step the two series of 
 prices to be analysed for (combination of different things together that work as one unit) are tested for stationarity, using the increased Dickey-Fuller (ADF) 
 unit root test. After the confirmation of non-stationarity the price series are tested for cointegration using the 
 Johansen method. 
 For comparison reasons and if non-stationarity as well as cointegration can be ended/decided, a linear vector 
 error correction model (1) is guessed in a second step using the error correction term created by the

 Johansen method. The number of included falls behind (k) is figured out by/decided by the Akaike information judging requirement (AIC). 
 To guess the more general dividing line vector error correction model (3) we have to decide/figure out the dividing line 
 Î³. For this we use a version of the Hansen and Seo (2001) search procedure10 that depends on the log 
 (thing that decides something) of the guessed error covariance matrix of (3) as the selection judging requirements. The selection judging requirements has 
 the following form: 
 
 (4) 
 Goodwin and Piggott (2001) use a different selection judging requirement that is based on the trace of the variancecovariance matrix of the extras/payments. This selection judging requirement ignores the possible cross relationship between the 
 two equations of (3). In a paper Serra and Goodwin (2002) focus on the issues of choosing selection judging requirements. 
 Using a Monte Carlo experiment they found no scientific support that ignoring the cross-equation relationship 
 leads to wrong guesses of the dividing line. 
 The value of Î³ that (makes small) (4) is chosen. (forced (on people)/caused an inconvenient situation) on this search procedure is the restriction that both 
 governments should contain at least a pre-specified fraction (Ï0) of the total sample.11 So the following 
 expression should always be made happy: 
 (5) 
 After deciding/figuring out the dividing line limit/guideline Î³, the (meaningful numbers) of the dividing line is calculated in a 
 third step. Because of the unidentified annoyance limit/guideline (Î³) that is not present in the non-linear model (1), 
 ordinary tests statistics have non-standard distributions. Therefore, Hansen and Seo propose the use of a 
 SupLM test and helping ways of doing things to calculate p-values. 
 RESULTS OF AN EMPIRICAL APPLICATION 
 For our analysis we have chosen pig prices in Germany and the Netherlands, both major pig markets in 
 Europe. The share of German pig production in total EU production was 21% in 1995, and the share of 
 Dutch pig production was 13% (ZMP 1999). In our analysis we use weekly price data for pigs ((Euro)/100kg 
 murderweight). The price data is collected in the Netherlands and Germany at the farm gate level and 
 given by the ZMP (Zentrale Markt- und Preisberichtstelle). Our price series starts in June 1989 and ends 
 in March 2001. 14 weeks with missing data in one or both countries have been left out from the sample. 
 Therefore our total sample for this period contains 600 (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements). For further analysis we use the 
 logarithmic form of the price data. 
 The increased Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test confirms a unit-root in the pig price series for the Netherlands and 
 also in the series of pig prices in Germany (see table 1). Johansen's maximum eigenvalue statistic as well as 
 the Johansen trace statistic reject the null guess of no cointegrating vector at a importance level of 99% 
 (see table 1) 12. After (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy)ization with respect to the Dutch pig prices13, we calculate the cointegration 
 relationship (table 1) and get extras/payments, which can be understood/explained as mistakes from a long-term 
 balance. 
 
 10 
 
 We only search over the dividing line limit/guideline Î³ and not also over the cointegration limit/guideline(s). 
 For the scientific application we set the trimming limit/guideline to 0.05. Therefore each government is restricted to contain at 
 least 5% of all (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements). Hansen &amp; Seo 2002; Ben-Kaabia &amp; Gil et al. 2002 and Goodwin &amp; Piggott 2001 choose 
 the same value. 
 12 
 The constant is held down and stopped from the fitted moving backward and included in the cointegration moving backward. 
 13 
 (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy)isation with respect to the German pig prices leads to very almost the same  results.

 The Breusch-Godfrey test points to/shows the presence of autocorrelation at the 5% importance level. 
 Autocorrelation may be due to a misspecified functional form. As we will see below the TVECM does not 
 suffer from autocorrelation. So the results of autocorrelation might be understood/explained as (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) in favour 
 of the TVECM. Due to the autocorrelated extras/payments of the VECM, the results can only be understood/explained with 
 NL 
 caution. Fell behind price changes in the Netherlands ( ap tNL 
 a'1 ;ap t a' 2 ) have no significant effect on the price 
 (change to make better/related to changing something) in Germany or the Netherlands, whereas fell behind price changes in Germany seem to have a shortNL 
 term effect on price (change to make better/related to changing something) (except ap GER 
 t a'2 on ap t ). The guessed coefficients for the (change to make better/related to changing something) to 
 mistakes from the long-term balance point to/show a stronger reaction of pig prices in the Netherlands to 
 such mistakes ( Ï NL = a'0.114 ) than in Germany ( ÏGER = 0.068 ). 
 Applying the described search procedure produces /gives up a dividing line limit/guideline of Î³=0.095. Based on this limit/guideline 
 the TVECM (3) is divided into two governments. Government 1 is defined by those weekly prices where the total 
 moving away from the long-term balance is below 9.5%. Calculated at average prices this moving away represent 
 roughly 14 (Euro)/100kg murderweight. This way if the moving away from the long-term balance is below 
 14 (Euro)/100kg murderweight, no (change to make better/related to changing something) will happen. For every (instance of watching, noticing, or making a statement) in government 2 the total 
 moving away from the long-term balance is above 9.5%. The (change to make better/related to changing something) government 1 (the "band of nonadjustment") contains 94,6% of all (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements). This (change to make better/related to changing something) government can therefore be represented as the 
 "general" government whereas government 2, containing only 5,4% of all (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements), is referred as an "extreme" 
 government, containing bigger mistakes from the long-term balance. Using Hansen's fixed move backwardor 
 help way of doing things with 10.000 answers/copies we find the critical dividing line to be significant at 5% (p-value = 
 0.032). Results for the SupLM tests can be found in Table 1.

 Guessed coefficients in government 1 are just like the guesses from the linear VECM. As in the VECM, only 
 (for only a short time) reactions to fell behind price changes in Germany have a significant effect on the German or Dutch 
 pig price changes in the TVECM. But unlike the VECM, the dividing line model shows no significant 
 (change to make better/related to changing something) to mistakes from the long-term balance, if these mistakes are below the critical dividing line 
 (government 1). These results are in line with assumed transaction costs that prohibit a perfect price (change to make better/related to changing something). 
 Only if the total mistakes from the long-term balance are above the critical dividing line (government 2) 
 (change to make better/related to changing something) does happen. These expected results can be found in the strong (change to make better/related to changing something) of the German pig 
 price to mistakes from the long-term balance contained in government 2 ( ÏGER 
 = 0.417 ). The Dutch price 
 2 
 shows no significant (change to make better/related to changing something) to mistakes from the long-term balance in both governments. 
 Price (change to make better/related to changing something) according to the guessed VECM differs much from (change to make better/related to changing something) according to the 
 TVECM. The VECM suggest that the Dutch pig price as well as the German price react to mistakes from 
 the long-term balance. The possibly more meaningful TVECM points to/shows no significant reaction of the 
 Dutch price to such mistakes. Price leadership analyses that are based on guessed reactions to mistakes 
 from the long-term balance (eg. Kuiper &amp; Meulenberg 2002) will be sensitive to those differences. 
 CONCLUSIONS AND SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH 
 Analyses of market (combination of different things together that work as one unit) based on price data alone have been criticised, because they often neglect the 
 role of transaction costs. To overcome this opinion we suggest the use of dividing line vector error correction 
 models. These models can account for the effects of transaction costs in price transmission, without directly 
 depending on transaction cost data. A three government TVECM would be most good to fit the money-based 
 needed things for the analysis of price (change to make better/related to changing something), but unfortunately so far no consistent (related to studying numbers) test for the 
 importance of two dividing lines is available. Therefore we propose a testable two-government dividing line model that 
 includes a "band of non-(change to make better/related to changing something)". Our results show that ignoring dividing line effects lead to sneaky and false 
 results. 
 Clearly the use of TVECM for analysing price (change to make better/related to changing something) is at its beginning. Tests for a three government 
 TVECM could be developed. Such models would have the advantage of (taking control of) potential not mirror-images 
 price (change to make better/related to changing something) processes. A (big statement based on very little information) to a multivariate model (thinking about/when one thinks about) (change to make better/related to changing something) of more than 
 two prices is also of interest, as are models that clearly account for transaction costs. 
 The TVECM is based on the idea (you think is true) of constant transaction costs through the analysed period. If market 
 integration is expected to increase over time e.g. due to less transaction costs, the TVECM could be 
 extended to variable dividing lines.
