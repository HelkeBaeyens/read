 Abstract 
 Factors affecting the cost to the farmer of employing soil wearing away reduction plans are examined for the steep 
 hillsides near Tegucigalpa, Honduras. Linear programming and MOTAD are used to examine these factors. Results 
 point to/show that some modest reductions in wearing away can be (accomplished or gained) at little cost to the farmer by reorganizing 
 production, switching .rotations, and using outline plowing. These modest reductions still lead to very high 
 rates of wearing away. Sharper reductions may be (accomplished or gained) at (more and more) higher costs as wearing away control structures are 
 built and land is left unplanted. There is a high cost to the farmer of reducing wearing away to 'sustainable' levels. A 
 consistent tradeoff comes out between levels of soil (protecting something from harm), income, and risk; wearing away reduction efforts lead to 
 lower incomes and higher risk. The analysis of likely benefits to farmers for wearing away reduction shows that even under 
 ideas (you think are true) of very high yield losses from soil wearing away, best farm plans still lead to high rates of soil loss, suggesting 
 a need for policies that (make a part of you) externalities if off-farm damages are to be (made small). 
 
 1. Introduction 
 
 Major increases in farming-based production have 
 happened/been made real in developing countries over the 
 last half century. However, those increases have 
 been weird over time, uneven among countries 
 and areas, and concerns are more and more expressed that production growth may not be (able to last/helping the planet) under current farming-based practices. One 
 of the first (or most important) (the ability to keep something around, or keep something going) concerns is that soils 
 are wearing away at a fast rate leading to declines in

 potential farming-based working well. Soil wearing away 
 also leads to off-farm hits/effects such as siltation of 
 rivers resulting in flooding, reduced water quality, 
 and reduced holding tank ability (to hold or do something). In many countries, poorness and population pressures have led 
 to increased (producing crops/helping something grow) of steep delicate lands. In 
 other countries, pricing policies have created (rewards or reasons for doing something) for intensive (producing crops/helping something grow) in areas (before that/before now) farmed a lot. Traditional practices, 
 which may have been (able to last/helping the planet) under lower 
 population pressures and long/big farming conditions, are highly erosive under intensive farming of not important lands. 
 The long-run solutions to soil wearing away problems depend on reduced population growth, in-

 creased non-farm employment opportunities, 
 more fair distribution of land in certain 
 countries, and policies that discourage farming on 
 highly erosive lands. In the short run, however, 
 (rewards or reasons for doing something) can be created to encourage the use of 
 soil (protecting something from harm) practices on these lands. Farmer 
 decisions to employ soil conserving measures are 
 influenced by net returns, attitudes toward risk, 
 planning horizons and discount rates, available 
 technology, and education, among other factors 
 (Anderson and Thampapillai, 1990). These factors, in turn, can be influenced by government 
 policies that affect prices, access to credit, land 
 titling, and education. 
 The importance of these factors has been the 
 subject of a big amount of scientific analysis in developed countries since the 1950s. Boggess 
 et al. (1979), Walker and Timmons (1980) and 
 White and Partenheimer (1980), each found that 
 soil (protection of natural things/using less energy, water, etc.) methods reduced net farm income in the short run in the United States. 
 Kramer et al. (1983) found that risk disgust 
 suggested crop mixes with greater levels of per area of land 
 soil loss in Virginia. Again in the United States, 
 Seitz et al. (1979), Erwin and Washburn (1981) 
 and Walker (1982) found that farmers will not 
 use wearing away control practices to maintain working well of their land unless they have very low 
 discount rates and long planning horizons. Soil 
 wearing away can take many years to have a significant 
 effect on farming-based working well. Unfortunately, 
 in not important areas of developing countries, planning horizons are likely to be short and the rate 
 of discount high because farmers operate at barely 
 an income level. They are likely to place (in a big way) higher value on the use of soil useful things/valuable supplies 
 today than in the future. 
 Luckily, many technical solutions exist for 
 controlling soil wearing away not only in developed but 
 also in developing countries. Terraces, outline 
 (producing crops/helping something grow), reduced land, live (blocking things), hill-side 
 ditches, and changed crop rotations are just a 
 few of the field-level practices employed. Most of 
 these practices are quite practical even in low 
 income countries, and have been (helped increase/showed in a good way) by 
 extension services there for many years. Because 
 these practices often require investments, access 
 to credit may be important to the adoption deci- 
 
 sian (Bored/boring, 1960; Van Vuuren, 1986). Binswanger (1980) found that in (away from cities) India, farmers' 
 investment in land improvements is affected by 
 ability to get credit. Output and input pricing 
 policies can also influence decisions to put into use 
 conservation practices. (material that makes plants grow better) payments may 
 cause farmers to ignore soil (protecting something from harm) practices in the belief that (material that makes plants grow better)s will maintain 
 farming-based working well (even though there is the existence of) losses in topsoil 
 (Walker and Young, 1986). Price policies, including exchange rate policies, that often discriminate 
 against farming in developing countries may 
 reduce (rewards or reasons for doing something) to invest in land-conserving activities by reducing the value of farmland (Repetto, 1989). Policies that distort individual output 
 prices may either encourage or reduce soil wearing away depending on the degree of erosivity of 
 particular crops. Land titling can influence soil 
 wearing away as secure land (length of time at work or in power/right to permanent employment) may be needed for 
 farmers to invest in soil (protecting something from harm) practices. 
 Feder and Onchan (1987) found this to be the 
 case in Thailand, although Lee (1980) found little 
 relationship between (length of time at work or in power/right to permanent employment) security and soil wearing away in the United States. 
 (compared to other things) little scientific analysis of farm-level 
 money-based (rewards or reasons for doing something) for soil (protecting something from harm) has been 
 done in developing countries. Barbier (1990) 
 summarized (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) from a few sources on the 
 factors influencing adoption of soil conservation 
 in the uplands of Java. Veloz et al. (1985) guessed net returns and social benefits from wearing away control in a (related to an area of land that drains into a river) in the Dominican 
 Republic. But scientific analysis of (rewards or reasons for doing something) for 
 different practices has been thinly distributed, in part because of the difficulty in calculating soil losses 
 connected with the practices. Also, no scientific 
 studies in developing countries have incorporated 
 risk analysis in their money-based tests of soil 
 conservation practices. The purpose of the current paper is to present the results of a case study 
 of the on-site costs and benefits of different soil 
 conservation practices in Honduras. 1

 not because they are unimportant, but in order to focus on 
 money-based factors influencing farmers decisions concerning soil 
 conservation.

 Problems of soil wearing away are reported to be 
 critical in the central and southern areas of the 
 country (Tracy, 1988). Guesses of soil loss per 
 ha go beyond 300 tons per year on steep slopes 
 under traditional farming-based practices. Doubt about land (length of time at work or in power/right to permanent employment) describes almost 
 the whole country. Honduran farmers also face 
 doubt about money-based returns. Information 
 is needed on the risk connected with those practices as previous studies suggest that farmers are 
 likely to be risk disliking (Just, 1974). 
 Specific goals of this paper are to: (a) 
 summarize the results of a study that examined 
 the most money-making mix of soil (protecting something from harm) practices and crops under a few levels of soil loss 
 and risk; (b) carefully study the effects that different 
 planning horizons have on the money-making ability of 
 those practices and because of this, indirectly, on the importance of land (length of time at work or in power/right to permanent employment); and (c) present effects/results/suggestions for specific public policies affecting soil 
 wearing away in Honduras. A linear programming 
 model is used in the scientific analyses. 
 
 2. Description of the study area 
 
 The study area is located in the Guacerique 
 Watershed in the central area of Honduras. 
 This (related to an area of land that drains into a river) provides 60% of the water ate/destroyed in the capital city, Tegucigalpa. Soil wearing away is a concern for policy makers due to its 
 effect on water quality and on the lives of the 
 major holding tanks for Tegucigalpa.

 About 20% of the (related to an area of land that drains into a river) (180 km 2 ) 
 is dedicated to agriculture while 70% is forested 
 and 10% is loyal to/is dedicated to animal production and to 
 population centers. The average height is 1420 
 m above sea level and the average once-a-year temperature of 18Â°C differs/changes by height. Average (rain, snow, etc.) is 1200 mm per year. 
 The study area is the most important supplier 
 of (plant-related) products for the central and 
 southern markets of the country, although only 
 5% of the farming-based area is loyal to/is dedicated to vegetable production. Eighty-two percent of the farming-based area is planted to survival/income crops, especially corn and, less so, beans. Fields 
 are usually small, from 0.3 to 1.0 manzanas, 
 and farms average 1.5 to 2.0 manzanas. 2 
 Two of the first (or most important) problems facing farming in the  (related to an area of land that drains into a river) are soil wearing away and improper use of bug-killers that contaminate the 
 Guacerique river (Welchez, personal interview, 
 1991). Concern for both these problems (gave a reason to do something) the (creation and construction/ group of objects) of the USAID-supported 
 Land Use and Production Improvement (LUPE) 
 project in the area. LUPE personnel educate 
 farmers about (able to last/helping the planet) farming practices, and 
 have did lots of (lists of people's interests, qualities, skills, etc.) of the area.

 3. Methods and data 
 
 A representative farm model was built 
 for the (related to an area of land that drains into a river) using field survey data, business/project budgets, and calculations of soil loss using 
 the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) with its 
 coefficients custom-designed to Honduras. The model was 
 solved using linear programming, with an goal of making the most of net returns subject to different 
 levels of soil loss and risk. The model included a few soil (protecting something from harm) practices and (producing crops/helping something grow) methods. 
 A highly grouped scene for the base model 
 without risk activities and restrictions is presented 
 in Table 1. The letters A, B and C represent sets 
 of coefficients. In general, a negative sign on a 
 coefficient in the scene points to/shows that an activity 
 supplies cash, production, labor, etc., while a 
 positive sign points to/shows that a product, input, or 
 cash is needed/demanded. The presence of both a positive 
 and a negative sign on the same coefficient points to/shows that the coefficient in the scene represents a set of coefficients on rows and activities 
 containing poth positive and negative signs. 
 Major activities included crop production on 
 three land types, labor hiring, borrowing, selling 
 crops, construction of soil (protecting something from harm) devices, 
 cash moves (from one place to another), and an activity to place a minimum bound on family expenses. A total of 
 243 activities were included. Major restrictions 
 included land, labor, crop moves (from one place to another), rotations, 
 credit, soil loss, and cash. A total of 197 restrictions were included. When a risk part was added to the model, the unemotional function was to (make small) mean total mistakes 
 from average income for a few levels of net 
 returns and soil loss. Mistakes from mean income from each activity were included in a set of 
 risk restrictions at the bottom of the model following the MOTAD procedure of Hazell and 
 Norton (1986). 
 Crops may be grown on land type A (2% 
 slope), land type B (10% slope), or land type C 
 (24% slope). There were 181 crop production 
 activities that resulted from combinations of 
 crops, planting seasons, land types, soil (protecting something from harm) devices used, and land systems. Cropping 
 activities used land, labor, and capital to produce 
 
 crops that were moved (from one place to another) and sold. Land could 
 also be taken out of production to meet soil loss 
 restrictions. Borrowing activities were allowed in 
 each month at the interest rate being charged by 
 the farmers' cooperative, the first (or most important) source of 
 credit in the area. Borrowing supplied cash in 
 each month and needed/demanded payment with interest 
 in later months. Available family labor was 
 48 person-months per year. 
 Monthly cash needed things for productive inputs were calculated for each crop. All such cash 
 needed things and family expenses were paid from 
 an initial cash gift, crop sales, or from 
 borrowing. Moves (from one place to another) of extra cash to the later month were made each month. At the end 
 of the year, cash had to be (good) enough to pay back 
 loans and to replace the first cash gift. 3 
 Coefficients on cropping activities in the soil loss 
 restriction specified the amount of soil loss for 
 particular crops on each land type in each time 
 period under different land practices and with 
 different soil (protecting something from harm) devices. The right hand 
 side of this restriction specified the amount of soil 
 loss allowed for the farm. 
 3.1. Farmer survey 
 
 Data to create many of the coefficients for 
 the representative farm models were gotten by 
 surveying farmers in the (related to an area of land that drains into a river) during July 
 1991. Twelve farmers were chosen at random 
 from the list of farmers in the area given by 
 the LUPE project. In each interview farmers were 
 asked questions about the make-up of the family, 
 land (length of time at work or in power/right to permanent employment), crops and rotations including production costs and output prices, soil conservation 
 practices, labor use and costs, and credit. The 
 length and slope of each field were measured, 
 and the number of manzanas that fall within each 
 
 3 The cash restriction began with an gift of 494 
 Lempiras (US$1.00 = 5.5 L.). Each month, 386 L. for family 
 expenses and input expenses that varied by crop, depending 
 on the budget and farming-based calendar, were subtracted. 
 Sales of crops added to the cash in the month in which the 
 sales happened, and the household was free to borrow for 
 consumption at the appropriate interest rate.

 slope and the crops grown on each degree of 
 slope were recorded. 
 The average farm in the survey was found to 
 have 1.7 manzanas with 35% of the area with an 
 average slope of 2%, 26% of the area with an 
 average slope of 10%, and 39% with an average 
 slope of 24%. 
 The most important crops in the area are corn, 
 beans, corn and beans intercropped, cabbage, 
 onions, and tomatoes. A small amount of coffee 
 is also produced. Production is continuous from 
 May through December (the rainy season), and 
 when crop-watering/rinsing with water is available it extends through the 
 summer months of January through April. Sixty 
 percent of the farmers have crop-watering/rinsing with water on an average of 24% of the area. 
 The main means of conserving soil found in 
 the survey included outline (producing crops/helping something grow), live (blocking things), hill-side ditches, and terraces. The most common land system found was ordinary, with 
 minimum and no-till watched/followed on a few farms. All 
 three land systems were included in the linear 
 programming model for corn, beans, and cornbeans intercropped. Only ordinary land was 
 allowed in the model for cabbage, tomatoes, 
 onions, and coffee. 
 The average family consisted of four people. 
 Farming-based activities were (did/done/completed) to a greater 
 degree by men and children, but women helped 
 with farming-based activities when needed. A cooperative in the area gave/given credit at a once-a-year 
 interest rate of 24% although only three out of 
 the 12 farmers surveyed used credit. 
 3.2. Soil loss values 
 
 Soil loss values were needed/demanded for each production activity. These values were included into 
 a soil loss restriction and specified the amount of 
 soil loss that would happen under clearly stated/particular management practices, weather, type of soil, slope, and 
 soil (protecting something from harm) devices. The USLE was used to 
 calculate soil loss coefficients. Briefly, the USLE 
 (describes the future) gross soil loss per unit of land as: 
 
 A =RKLSCP 
 where A is the figured out/calculated soil loss per unit area 
 per unit of time, R is a rainfall and runoff factor, 
 
 261 
 
 K is a soil erodability factor, L is a slope length 
 factor, S is a slope steepness factor, C is a ground cover and management factor, and P is a 
 support practice factor. The last thing just mentioned is the ratio of 
 soil loss with a device like outlineing or terracing 
 to that with straight-row farming up and down 
 the slope. 
 Values for each factor were received/made from for the 
 study area. The rainfall and runoff factor, R, was 
 located in a study completed near the study area 
 (Wouters, 1980). The soil erodability factor was 
 calculated using information from a soil analysis 
 in the study area (Recursos Hfdricos, 1983) and 
 from Wischmeier and Smith (1978). Values for P, 
 L and S were also received/got from Wischmeier 
 and Smith except for live (blocking things). Values for live 
 (blocking things) were based on figured-out values between outline (producing crops/helping something grow) and hillside ditches. 
 The C factor is measured as the ratio of soil loss 
 from an area with specified cover and management to that with tilled unplanted. It was calculated 
 for each combination of crop and land system 
 following procedures in Wischmeier and Smith. 
 Crop stages were identified through discussion 
 with farm experts in the area. Cabbage, onions, 
 and beans were the most erosive crops. 
 3.3. Budgets 
 
 Crop budgets were built and the resulting information on input use, prices, and input 
 costs was included into the linear programming model. Budgets were based on those published for the Central area of Honduras and 
 (changed to make better/changed to fit new conditions) by information gathered in the farm 
 level survey and by farm experts in the area. Yields 
 were varied by slope. Land with 2% slope was 
 assumed to produce 0.5% more than land with 10% 
 slope and 3% more than land with 24% slope. 
 These yield differences reflect only the effect of 
 slope on the amount of flat/left-and-right land area 
 under production and because of this may be thought about/believed 
 to be minimum differences. Other factors such as 
 lower root depth, and poorer nutrient content are 
 likely to reduce yields on higher sloped lands by 
 even more; data for these changes/recalculations do not, 
 however, exist.

 servation devices were calculated based on information in Almendariz (1990), Tracy and Mungia 
 (1986), Michaelson (1986), and from information 
 given by LUPE personnel. These costs, which 
 were composed completely of hired labor expenses, 
 were averaged over a 10-year planning (line in the distance where the Earth and sky meet); 
 the practices were assumed to have a 10-year life. 
 So, one tenth of the total construction labor 
 and a 10% once-a-year maintenance (money given/freedom to move) were 
 charged for each (protection of natural things/using less energy, water, etc.) device in the once-a-year model. Including in something of (protection of natural things/using less energy, water, etc.) devices also 
 needed/demanded calculation of their effects on the amount 
 of land available to help grow. The amount of land 
 removed from production by the presence of these 
 devices (such as grass strips, etc.) on steep slopes 
 is (large/relatively large). 
 
 Risk was included in the model by gathering 5 
 years of average yield data from different sources 4 
 and crop prices (retail) from a (book, magazine, etc.) of the 
 Unidad de Planificaci6n Part/areaial Agricola (1990). 
 So, both produce and price risk were included in 
 the measurement of income risk in the model. 
 A one-year linear programming model that 
 (makes as big as possible) net farm income was used to examine 
 the effects of different soil loss levels on farm 
 income. The one-year model may be thought about/believed 
 to be an average year when the farmer is in an 
 balance state. A MOTAD model that mini-

 4.1. Income-soil loss tradeoffs 
 
 4. Results 
 
 Four sets of analyses were completed with the 
 linear programming model: (a) income-soil loss 
 tradeoffs, (b) risk-income tradeoffs, (c) (serious thought/something to think about/respect) of the effects of changing the length of planning (line in the distance where the Earth and sky meet), and (d) an analysis of the best 
 level of soil loss given a range of ideas (you think are true) 
 about the effect of wearing away reduction on average 
 produces. The result of these analyses are presented 
 below with (understanding/ explanation) of selected shadow 
 
 The effects of different soil loss limits on net 
 farm income, crops produced, and on (protecting something from harm) devices and land systems are presented in 
 Table 2. With no limit on soil loss, 328 tons of 
 soil per manzana per year would be lost (this 
 amount is called the base loss) and a net income 
 of 5929 L. (this is equal to US$1078) would 
 be earned on the representative farm. More than 
 a 50% reduction in soil wearing away can be (accomplished or gained) 
 with little effect on income. However, when soil 
 loss is restricted to 20% or less of the first base

 loss, income drops more sharply. If only 2% of 
 the amount of soil loss under no restrictions is 
 allowed (7 tons per manzana per year), income is 
 reduced to 2826 L. 5 
 Bean, cabbage, and onion production under 
 ordinary land and outline (producing crops/helping something grow) lead 
 to the highest income and greatest soil loss. Borrowing happens only in May and labor is not hired. 
 Soil loss restrictions have little effect on the mix 
 of crops grown until only 20% of the base soil 
 loss is allowed. At that point, coffee is grown on 
 the steepest slopes. When only 2% of the base 
 soil loss is permitted, the steepest slopes are left 
 rude. 
 Ordinary land with outline (producing crops/helping something grow) 
 rules, but as wearing away restrictions are 
 tightened, first live (blocking things) with ordinary 
 land and later terraces with ordinary land 
 enter the solution. With only 10% of the first 
 soil loss allowed, live (blocking things) with minimum 
 land come in, and at 2% soil loss allowed, 
 terraces combined with minimum and no-till enter the solution. Hillside ditches never enter the 
 solution because they are roughly as effective as 
 live (blocking things) in reducing wearing away but cost more to 
 construct. Income levels drop when lower 
 amounts of soil loss are allowed because of the 
 cost involved in building (protecting something from harm) devices, the moves/changes in crop mix, and the land removed from production at very (serving to severely limit or control) levels 
 of soil loss. 
 4.2. Risk-income tradeoffs 
 
 The effects of wearing away reduction plans on 
 the risk-return tradeoff faced by farmers were 
 carefully studied under two pictures/situations. In the first, risk 
 was (made small) subject to different levels of income with no restriction on the amount of soil 
 loss. In the second, risk was (made small) subject to 
 the income and wearing away levels in Table 2. The 
 results of the analysis for the (free to move around/without rules or restrictions) soil 
 loss picture/situation are summarized in Table 3 with 
 
 5 Average per person income in Honduras in 1989 was

 respect to income levels, soil loss, and cropping 
 activities. 
 Income and risk are positively related and so 
 as risk is reduced, so too is income. Soil loss 
 declines with income and risk, but (definitely/as one would expect)
 higher levels of soil loss are related to any 
 particular level of income when soil loss is (free to move around/without rules or restrictions) compared to the case when soil loss is 
 held back. When risk is (made small), beans and 
 cabbage enter the solution at every income level 
 whereas corn and beans-corn intercropped enter 
 only at lower levels of income and risk (compare 
 Tables 2 and 3). Onions enter only at higher 
 levels of income and risk. Under this picture/situation 
 with no soil loss restrictions, wearing away control devices are not built. Because of this, all changes in 
 soil loss are due to differences in cropping activities. 
 Expected income and variance (EV) edges of something/unexplored areas 
 were built for (a) the picture/situation in which 
 risk was (made small) for a few levels of income 
 but soil loss was not restricted and (b) the picture/situation in which risk was (made small) and both income and soil loss were held back (Fig. 1). 
 These EV edges of something/unexplored areas show that there is a lot more risk met when (accomplishing or gaining) 
 the held back level of soil loss. Because most 
 studies have found farmers to be risk disliking, this 
 hints that (machines/methods/ways) for reducing price and 
 yield risk may be needed to provide added/more 
 (rewards or reasons for doing something) for soil (protecting something from harm). Crop insurance

 research on drought and pest resistance) are examples. 
 4.3. Planning horizons 
 
 Different degrees of land (length of time at work or in power/right to permanent employment) security may 
 cause farmers to differ in their planning horizons. 
 The model was changed to allow for a few 
 lengths of planning horizons to test the effects 
 on use of soil (protecting something from harm) practices. Planning 
 horizons of 10, 5, 3 years and 1 year were carefully thought about/believed. This difference in planning (line in the distance where the Earth and sky meet)  was 
 modeled by changing the cost of the soil (protecting something from harm) devices. 6 For example, one-tenth of the 
 construction and life time maintenance costs of 
 the devices were charged for the 10-(line in the distance where the Earth and sky meet). 
 One-fifth, one-third, and full cost were charged 
 in later runs of the model. 
 Modeling of planning horizons in such a fashion maybe gave a reason for in two ways. First, since the 
 costs of construction of devices are mainly labor 
 costs, labor sharing commonly found the area is 
 agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with such a modeling of the planning 
 (line in the distance where the Earth and sky meet). Or, we could argue that we 
 
 are mid-way through the planning (line in the distance where the Earth and sky meet), and 
 that a fraction of total maintenance is needed 
 along with a payback of borrowed money for labor 
 hiring during construction. The model does not 
 include the (in a true way) lumpy costs of making 
 such investments, but as we see below, even with 
 lumpiness, model results are not changed. 
 The results of these analyses are presented in 
 Table 4. The results across the different cost 
 ideas (you think are true) about planning horizons differ very 
 little. At high levels of permitted soil loss, few 
 conservation devices are built and therefore there are very small differences in income. 
 Medium levels of soil loss lead to somewhat larger 
 income differences. When soil loss is reduced to 
 very low levels, unplanted land enters the solution 
 with the result that the cost of (protecting something from harm) devices has little effect. 
 One reason the cost of building soil (protecting something from harm) devices is (compared to other things) low is the low opportunity cost of labor, the major input in building the devices. Because of the low cost, the 
 effects of spreading the costs over varied planning horizons are (almost nothing/very little). Second, much wearing away 
 reduction comes from (changing to make better/changing to fit new conditions) cropping patterns. These costs are independent of the length 
 of planning (line in the distance where the Earth and sky meet). 
 4.4. Yield changes 
 
 6 
 
 We assume that the devices are completely built in 
 the representative year model. That is, even though costs are 
 spread over, say, a 10-year (line in the distance where the Earth and sky meet), the whole device is 
 built and adding/giving to wearing away control during the 
 year we examine. The model this way represents an average year, 
 and not the adoption of (protecting something from harm) structures. 
 
 Unfortunately, no information is available on 
 the long-term effects of soil wearing away on yields. 
 Yields probably fall over time due to reduced 
 life-creating ability following soil wearing away. The above results

 show that unless this soil working well effect is 
 significant, the length of planning (line in the distance where the Earth and sky meet)  will 
 have little influence on the decision to put into use soil 
 conservation practices. Because farmers in Honduras are likely to discount future benefits significantly due to the extreme harshness of current needs and 
 because they have little knowledge of future working well effects of wearing away, the influence of security of land (length of time at work or in power/right to permanent employment) on soil (protecting something from harm) decisions 
 is small. 
 Guesses of the best private level of soil 
 wearing away under different ideas (you think are true) about the 
 relationship between levels of wearing away and yield 
 changes were gotten in order to shed light on 
 the need for government helping actions to (help increase/show in a good way) wearing away reduction 7 . For each model activity, the percentage moving away from a recommended soil loss tolerance 8 was calculated. Activities with once-a-year wearing away rates above the tolerance were assumed to experience a yield decline, 
 while those with lower rates were assumed to 
 increase yields over time. The yield effects were 
 adjusted for all activities by assuming a yield 
 decline of a certain percentage for the most erosive activity, ordinary tilled cabbage on the 
 24% sloped land. Yields for this activity were 
 assumed to fall by 100%, 90%, 50% and 30% 
 over the 10-period (Z* in Fig. 2). A straight line 
 
 7 A energetic optimization model is the preferred approach 
 to examining the tradeoffs between benefits and costs over a 
 period of time. The average single-year approach is a fair 
 guess when the relationship between soil loss and 
 yields is linear. 
 8 The recommended loss tolerance used was 5 tons per 
 area of land, or 8.68 tons per manzana. There are no recommended 
 tolerances for Honduras, so we used the U.S. SCS guidelines 
 of 5 tons per area of land.

 is assumed to lose 100% of its yield over a 10period, income falls to 4472 L. per year and 
 'optimal' wearing away is 80.8 tons per manzana. If 
 produces /gives up are less (able to reply or react/quick to respond) to wearing away levels, income falls by less and wearing away increases. When 
 yields for the most erosive activity fall by only 
 30% over the 10-period, income averages 5229 L. 
 per year, with a once-a-year wearing away level of 219.1 
 tons per manzana. 
 When wearing away rates affect yields, a consistent 
 pattern comes out. Soil (protecting something from harm) devices are 
 built on the less steeply-sloped land (first 
 live (blocking things) and, as yields become more (able to reply or react/quick to respond), terraces), while rotation changes happen on 
 the less steeply-sloped land. As yield declines 
 caused by wearing away become (more and more) larger, 
 the 24% sloped land is slowly taken out of 
 production. The high rates of wearing away that happen 
 on the steeper slopes mean that production there 
 is impossible to do/impossible to keep going over time, though working well 
 actually grows (through soil (protecting something from harm)) on the 
 less steeply-sloped lands. 
 If information on produce responses were available 9 the results could be used to provide a 
 measure of best soil loss from the farmers' 
 (way of seeing things / sensible view of what is and is not important). Given the high levels of 'optimal 
 wearing away' from this analysis and the high off-farm 
 costs connected with wearing away, it is clear that there 
 
 9 No information from Honduras was available. As an example, Burt used a response ability to stretch of 0.33 in his (act of asking questions and trying to find the truth about something) of soil loss in Washington state. 
 
 is a need for government action to (help increase/show in a good way) reduced wearing away. If produces /gives up are very (able to reply or react/quick to respond) to 
 wearing away the private decision-maker will reduce 
 wearing away to 80.8 tons per manzana per year, yet 
 this level is still likely to create significant off-farm 
 damages, and soil working well on the steeplysloped lands will fall very much over the tenyear period. (rewards or reasons for doing something) need to be given to 
 increase the rates of (protecting something from harm) on more 
 steeply-sloped lands. 
 4.5. Shadow prices and sensitivity analysis 
 
 Shadow prices were calculated for different 
 levels of soil loss allowed, using the model without the risk part (Table 6). These shadow 
 prices represent the amount by which the unemotional function would change if the restriction on 
 soil loss were changed by one unit. They represent the cost of wearing away reductions. The value of 
 0.47 connected with high levels of wearing away means 
 that the not important value of an extra ton of soil loss 
 is 0.47 L. The value connected with changing the 
 soil loss restriction when only 10% is allowed is 
 20.98 L. This way as (more and more) less wearing away is 
 permitted, the cost of added/more reductions increases. 
 Sensitivity analysis was also (did/done/completed) on a few prices and on wages (Table 7). This analysis 
 is useful for testing the sensitivity of the best solution to changes in policies that might 
 influence these prices. Vegetable prices were 
 changed 10% (higher and lower), corn and beans 
 
 268 
 
 J.A. Carcamo eta!. j Farming-based Money flow 11 (1994) 257-269 
 
 were changed 15%, and coffee was changed 
 10%. 10 Farm income was more sensitive to 
 changes in vegetable prices than to changes in 
 prices of corn, beans, or coffee. Soil conservation 
 is helped as vegetable prices fall because vegetables are usually more erosive than other 
 crops. Coffee price changes have little effect on 
 income as (compared to other things) little coffee is grown even if 
 the price rises 10%. Increasing wages by 25% has 
 only a small/short effect on income. 
 5. Ends/end results and effects/results/suggestions 
 
 This paper has examined the money-based (rewards or reasons for doing something) for farmers to plant particular crops, use 
 different land practices, and construct soil 
 wearing away devices under increasing restrictions on 
 soil loss allowed and other choice levels of risk. 
 The results point to/show that (large/relatively large) reductions 
 in soil. loss can be (accomplished or gained), mostly through 
 changing cropping patterns. Big reductions 
 in the very high rates of wearing away found can only 
 be (accomplished or gained) at significant cost to the farmer. 
 Because of the high off-farm costs connected with 
 these wearing away rates, providing better information 
 to the farmer will not, alone, lead to wearing away 
 rates that are compatible with socially best 
 levels. If wearing away is reduced from 328 tons per 
 manzana per year to 7 tons per year, income 
 would be lowered from 5929 to 2826 L. However, 
 more than a 50% reduction in soil loss can be 
 (accomplished or gained) at (compared to other things) little loss of income. Cabbage and onions, the highest-return crops, are 
 also the most erosive and were always present in 
 the farm plans (without any concern about/having nothing to do with) the levels of soil loss 
 needed/demanded. The lowest levels of soil wearing away were 
 (accomplished or gained) when some land was removed from production. 
 Higher income plans were riskier (without any concern about/having nothing to do with) 
 the level of soil loss. However, reduced soil loss 
 was (accomplished or gained) at the cost of higher risk. Hence 
 risk may be a significant (blocking thing) to wider use of 
 soil wearing away practices in the (related to an area of land that drains into a river). 
 10 We examine changes in relative prices only; changes in 
 the overall price level will have a (fair in amount, related to something else/properly sized compared to something else) hit/effect on 
 income and, this way, are not examined. 
 
 (compared to other things) small differences in income were 
 found when the cost of building soil (protecting something from harm) devices was spread over a few years rather 
 than just one year. This small difference suggests 
 that insecure (length of time at work or in power/right to permanent employment) may not be a significant 
 (blocking thing) to adoption of these devices. Because of this, (reward or reason for doing something) packages designed to (help increase/show in a good way) construction of these devices may be effective (anyway/in any event) 
 of (length of time at work or in power/right to permanent employment) status. Because most of the soil wearing away 
 happened on the more steeply-sloped lands and 
 because the model never built wearing away 
 control devices on the steeply-sloped lands, special attention needs to be loyal to/be dedicated to them. (rewards or reasons for doing something) should be given either to take these 
 lands out of production (e.g., creation of permanent (area of grassy land)) or to (help increase/show in a good way) wearing away control there. 
 Government helping action is needed to (help increase/show in a good way) less erosive practices. Even if it is assumed 
 that produces /gives up are very (able to reply or react/quick to respond) to wearing away, high 
 levels of wearing away are best from a private decisionmaker's (way of seeing things / sensible view of what is and is not important). External costs of such 
 rates are likely to be too much/too many, so that action to 
 (make a part of you) the costs is necessary. 
 The idea (you think is true) of constant technical coefficients over a 10-planning (line in the distance where the Earth and sky meet)  may be silly. As soil is lost, the production relationships 
 change over time, and new technologies may also 
 change/differ  these relationships. Inventions of new things that make it 
 easier to (protect from harm) soil, including better ground 
 cover, wider root bases, and more quickly-developing plant varieties may benefit these farmers. It 
 is clear that the cost to the farmer of conserving 
 is too much/too many under current technologies, and improved (using less of something) ways of doing things are needed to 
 (accomplish or gain with effort) the twin goals of conserving soil and 
 maintaining farm incomes. The inventions of new things described above may also lower yield risk. 
 Some other policy effects/results/suggestions of this study 
 are that the government may want to provide 
 (rewards or reasons for doing something) to farmers to target steeper slopes for 
 coffee, (middle-position) slopes for corn and beans 
 and flatter areas for vegetables. These (rewards or reasons for doing something) 
 might be in the form of restrictions on particular 
 cropping practices or price policies. It appears 
 that live (blocking things) and minimum land should be 
 encouraged by the extension service. Policies to 
 reduce income risk may also encourage soil (protecting something from harm). Crop insurance, crop-watering/rinsing with water projects,

 price (making steady/making firm and strong) big plans/layouts/dishonest plans, or research to develop more drought- and pest-resistant crop varieties are examples.
