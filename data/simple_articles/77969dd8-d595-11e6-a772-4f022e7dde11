 Abstract 
 This article develops a new thin sliceal way(s) of doing things that clearly includes helpful change into an analysis of the hits/effects of climate change. 
 The way(s) of doing things examines how a farmer will change choices of species and number to change to fit climate. The approach is applied to study Africa, 
 where the hits/effects of climate change are expected to be the worst. The results point to/show that in warmer places, African farmers switch from 
 beef (cows, bulls, etc.)  to more heat-tolerant goats and sheep. In wetter places, farmers switch from (cows, bulls, etc.)  and sheep to goats and chickens. The results point to/show 
 that large commercial animals operations (focusing on doing one thing very well) in beef (cows, bulls, etc.)  will be hard hit from climate change whereas small farmers who can easily 
 substitute to goats and/or sheep will be more tough.

 1. Introduction 
 This article uses thin sliceal (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) to explore how 
 farmers change to fit (coming from the outside of something) (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) factors such as climate and soils. The model builds on the original ideas of 
 the Ricardian model that explored the center  of land value 
 per hectare (Mendelsohn et al., 1994). Although the Ricardian 
 model (takes control of) helpful change in its measure of hits/effects, it does 
 not provide any understanding of how farmers change. In this article, we develop a new approach, a (related to what holds something together and makes it strong) Ricardian Model, 
 that clearly models the hidden (under) endogenous decisions by 
 farmers. By comparing choices of farmers who face different 
 conditions, the model uncovers how farmers change. (may or may not happen, depending on something) 
 incomes, using a Ricardian approach, are then guessed for 
 each choice made by each farmer.

 We develop this new method and then apply it to study how 
 African farmers change  animals management to climate. We 
 explore which species they choose, how many animals they 
 own, and how net money/money income per animal for each species changes. 
 Understanding helpful change is an important goal in itself to help 
 planning by policy makers and private people. However, 
 understanding helpful change is also important if one is interested 
 in numbering the hits/effects of climate change. Forecasts that 
 over- or underpredict helpful change will under- or overpredict the 
 leftover/extra damages from climate change. 
 Climate hit/effect studies have regularly (described the future) long/big 
 hits/effects to the farming-based part/area from climate change across 
 the globe (Pearce et al., 1996; McCarthy et al., 2001; Tol, 2002). 
 Most of farming-based studies on the effect of climate change 
 have focused on crops. However, a large fraction of farming-based 
 output is from animals. In the United States, animals account 
 for about 40% of the market value of farming-based products sold 
 (USDA, 2002). Almost 80% of African farming-based land is used 
 for grazing. Yet there are very few money-based analyses of (related to the Earth's weather) effects on animals. An important exception is the study 
 of the effects of climate change on American animals (Adams 
 et al., 1999). American animals appear not to be (able to be hurt) 
 to climate change because most live in protected (surrounding conditions) 
 (sheds, barns, etc.) and rely heavily on additional/helping feed (e.g., 
 hay and corn). African animals have no (serving or acting to prevent harm) structures 
 and they graze off the land. As a result, we expect that

 African animals will be sensitive to climate change. In a separate article, the Ricardian model is applied to African animals 
 data (Seo et al., 2007) and shows that animals are sensitive 
 to climate. In this article we provide understanding of how farmers 
 (change to make better/change to fit new conditions) to climate and what they might do in the future. 
 The hidden (under) explanation of the (related to what holds something together and makes it strong) Ricardian Model is 
 developed in the next section. Section 3 discusses how data 
 were collected from over 5,000 farmers who own animals in 
 10 countries across Africa for this study. Section 4 discusses 
 the guess procedure and the thin sliceal scientific results. Forecasted hits/effects from three climate change pictures/situations 
 created by Air-related Ocean-related General Circulation Models (AOGCMs) are then examined in Section 5. The article 
 ends with a summary of results and policy effects/results/suggestions. 
 2. Explanation 
 A farmer's optimization decision can be seen as a (happening together) multiple-stage procedure. The farmer chooses the levels 
 of inputs, the desired number of animals, and the species that 
 will produce the highest net (money made/good thing received). Given the profit-making the most of 
 inputs from each farmer, one can guess the centers of profitmaximizing choices for each species across (coming from the outside of something) (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) factors such as temperature or (rain, snow, etc.). These 
 are the individual centers that lie beneath the overall profit function 
 for the farm (Mendelsohn et al., 1994). We call the approach 
 a "cross-sectional helpful change model" because it guesses the 
 choice of a clearly stated/particular animal, the number of animals, and the hidden (under) profit response functions per animal for each species 
 
 that form the overall profit function. For example, in Fig. 1 
 we display a traditional Ricardian response function with respect to hardenature. Underneath the center  of all choices is a 
 set of species-clearly stated/particular response functions. Given the climate, 
 the farmer must choose the most money-making species and also the 
 inputs that will (make as big as possible) the value of that species. We examine 
 the individual net money/money income functions for each species as well as 
 the overall net money/money income function across all species. We assume 
 that each farmer makes his animal farming/managing money decisions to (make as big as possible) (money made/good thing received). 2 Because of this, the chance that a species is chosen 
 depends on the money-making ability of that animal species (or crop if 
 one wants to examine the crop part/area). We assume that farmer 
 i's (money made/good thing received) in choosing animals j (j = 1, 2, . . . , J) is 
 Ïj i = V (Zj i ) + Îµj i , 
 
 (1) 
 
 where Z is a vector of (things that you control (like study times), that cause other things to change (like test scores)) that includes climate (numbers that change/things that change), soils, and other (how money affects people's lives) (numbers that change/things that change) such 
 as household (features/ qualities/ traits). The profit function in Eq. (1) is 
 composed of two parts/pieces: the (capable of being seen and known) part V and 
 an error term Îµ. The error term is unknown to the (person who works to find information), but 
 may be known to the farmer. The farmer will choose the animals that gives him the highest (money made/good thing received). The farmer will choose 
 2 The explanation of profit (biggest increase/best possible extent) can be (argued over) especially in Africa (De 
 Janvry et al., 1991; Moll, 2005; Singh et al., 1986). We made the following two 
 changes/recalculations to deal with the/to speak to the  issues arising from special situations of African markets. First, we assume that if a farmer uses/eats his own product, it is valued at 
 market price. Second, most farms depend on their own labor. Although it might 
 be reasonable to value own labor by market wages, scientific examinations did 
 not support any clearly stated/particular wage.

 Because the (money made/good thing received) described in Eq. (1) is watched/followed only for 
 the chosen species, one must correct for possible selection bias 
 when guessing the (may or may not happen, depending on something) net money/money income or numbers of 
 animals (Heckman, 1979). Since the farmer (makes as big as possible) net money/money income (may or may not happen, depending on something) on the choice of that species, the error in the 
 second-stage equation may be related to the error in the 
 first stage. According to Dubin and McFadden (1984), with the 
 idea (you think is true) of the following (being like a line) condition 4 : 
 J 
 
 The chance Pj i for the jth animals to be chosen is then 
 
 Pj i = 
 
 exp(Zj i Î³j ) 
 J 
 k=1 
 
 exp(Zki Î³k ) 
 
 , 
 
 (5) 
 
 which gives the chance that farmer i will choose animals 
 j among J animals (Chow, 1983; McFadden, 1981). 
 The limits/guidelines can be guessed by the maximum chance method using an repeating/repetitive (not going in a straight line) optimization way of doing things such as the Newton-Raphson method. These guesses 
 are CAN (Consistent and Asymptotically (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy)) under standard (happening over and over again in a predictable way) conditions (McFadden, 1999). 
 Note that farmers can choose more than one species of animals among the five species in our study. That is, there are many 
 combinations of animals species that the farmer could choose. 
 In this analysis, we assume that farmers choose one first (or most important) 
 species from the five species. A first (or most important) species is defined as 
 that which creates the highest total net money/money income for the farm 
 (Train, 2003). In another analysis of animals choice, we compare this approach using the first (or most important) species with an different 
 (mix of stocks, bonds, etc./document collection) approach that examines all possible choices including 
 combinations of species (Seo and Mendelsohn, 2007). The two 
 approaches produce almost the same  results. 
 (may or may not happen, depending on something) on the animals species chosen, we guess the 
 best number of animals per farm for each species and the 
 net money/money income per animal for each species. We depend on a two-stage 
 model. In the first stage, we guess the chance of selecting 
 a species (Eq. 5). In the second stage, (may or may not happen, depending on something) on the choice 
 of a clearly stated/particular species, we guess the best number of that 
 species and the net money/money income per animal. We identify the species 
 choice equations using the relative prices of each choice. We 
 identify the number of animal equations using the percentage 
 of grassland in the district. Note that this more general (number or thing that changes) 
 was used instead of grassland on the farm because many African 
 animals owners graze animals on common lands.

 Two common ideas (you think are true) about the error term are either the (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) or 
 the Gumbel distribution. (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) random (numbers that change/things that change) have the property that any 
 linear combination of (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) varieties is (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy). The difference between two 
 Gumbel random (numbers that change/things that change) has a logistic distribution, which is just like the 
 (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) but with larger tails. This way the choice is somewhat random with large 
 samples (Greene, 1998). 
 
 rj Â· (Îµj a' E(Îµj )), with 
 j =1 
 
 Pj i = Pr[Îµk a' Îµj &amp;lt; Vj a' Vk ]_) ak = j where Vj = V (Zj i ). (4) 
 Assuming Îµ is independently and identically Gumbel distributed 3 and Vk can be written linearly in the limits/guidelines 
 
 J 
 
 E(uj |Îµ1 , . . . , ÎµJ ) = Ï Â· 
 
 j =1 
 
 rj = 0, 
 (6) 
 
 where uj is the error from the profit equation in the second 
 stage, Îµj is the error from the choice equation in the first stage, 
 Ï is the standard error of the profit equation, and rj the relationship between the profit equation and choice equations, then 
 the selection bias-corrected (may or may not happen, depending on something) (money made/good thing received) functions can be 
 regularly guessed as 
 J 
 
 Ïj = Xj Ïj + Ï Â· 
 
 ri Â·

 Pi Â· ln Pi 
 + ln Pj

 (7a) 
 
 where the second term on the right-hand side is the selection 
 bias correction term; Xj is a set of (things that you control (like study times), that cause other things to change (like test scores)) that 
 include climate (numbers that change/things that change), soils, and (how money affects people's lives) (numbers that change/things that change); 
 Ï j is a vector of limits/guidelines; and wj is the error term. 
 The best number of animals can be guessed in the same 
 manner: 
 J 
 
 Nj = Xj Î·j + Ï Â· 
 
 ri Â· 
 i=j 
 
 Pi Â· ln Pi 
 + ln Pj 
 1 a' Pi 
 
 + vj , 
 
 (7b) 
 
 where the different terms are defined (in almost the same way) as in Eq. (7a). 
 The two-stage model is composed of Eq. (5) and equations 
 (7a) and (7b). Expected net money/money income is therefore 
 J 
 
 Wi (Zi ) = 
 
 Pj (Zj i ) Â· Ïj (Zj i ) Â· Nj (Zj i ). 
 
 (8) 
 
 j =1 
 
 Because climate is an (thing that you control (like study time), that causes something else to change (like a test score)) in all three terms 
 in Eq. (8), the not important effect on welfare of a change in a 
 climate (number or thing that changes), say Zc , has three parts/pieces: the effect on the 
 chance of the animals to be chosen, the direct effect on the 
 (may or may not happen, depending on something) (money made/good thing received) per animal, and the effect on the (may or may not happen, depending on something) 
 number of animals:

 4 See Bourguignon et al. (2004) for the details of the selection bias corrections from the multinomial choice. They find that in most cases, Dubin and 
 McFadden's method is better than the most commonly used Lee method, 
 as well as to Dhal's semiparametric method. Monte Carlo experiments show 
 that selection bias correction based on the multinomial logit model can provide 
 fairly good correction for the result equation even when the IIA guess 
 is violated.

 aPj

 (10) 
 
 k=1 
 
 and the not important effect on the net money/money income per animal, assuming 
 a quadratic relationship between the net money/money income and the similar climate (number or thing that changes), can be gotten by (making different) 
 Eq. (7a): 
 aÏj 
 = Ïj 1 + 2 Â· Ïj 2 Â· zc , 
 azc 
 
 (11) 
 
 and the not important effect on the number of animals per farm, 
 also assuming a quadratic relationship between the number of 
 animals and the (connected/related) climate (number or thing that changes), can be found by 
 (making different) Eq. (7b): 
 aNj 
 = Î· j 1 + 2 Â· Î· j 2 Â· zc , 
 azc 
 
 (12) 
 
 where the subscripts 1 and 2 in equations (11) and (12) represent 
 the guessed limits/guidelines for the linear term and the quadratic 
 term for the climate changeable zc . 
 The change in welfare resulting from a nonmarginal change 
 in climate can be figured out/calculated as the difference in the expected 
 net money/money income in the two states before and after climate change. 
 Suppose that climate changes from Cbefore to Cafter . Then the 
 change in welfare can be came close to as 
 Wi = Wi (Cafter ) a' Wi (Cbefore ). 
 
 (13) 
 
 The doubt surrounding our measure of the welfare 
 change can be described by the 95% confidence period of time (or space) of 
 the expected climate change hit/effect. In way of thinking/basic truth/rule, there are two 
 ways to calculate confidence periods of time (or space): parametric and nonparametric. It is hard to calculate the variance of the climate 
 change hit/effect parametrically in this model because welfare is 
 the product of three (statements about the future). We provide doubt guesses in this study via a helping thing method by resampling 200 
 times from the original sample and calculating the 95% confidence period of time (or space) using the mean and the standard moving away of 
 the resulting climate change hits/effects (Andrews and Buchinsky, 
 2000). 
 3. Data 
 Data for this study come from a larger Worldwide  (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) Facility (GEF)-World Bank project to study climate change 
 hits/effects on farming in Africa (Dinar et al., 2008). The countries included were Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Egypt, Ethiopia, 
 Ghana, Kenya, Niger, Senegal, South Africa, and Zambia. (Zimbabwe had to be dropped from the animals analysis because 
 of mixed-up/disturbed conditions in that country during the survey.) The 
 
 countries were selected to represent the wide range of climate 
 throughout Africa. Districts within each country were selected 
 to provide as much within-country climate difference/different version as possible. 
 Because existing money-based data were not (good) enough to support 
 an analysis, an money-based survey of farmers was managed and did/done. The 
 original survey interviewed more than 9,000 farmers from 11 
 countries. Within that sample, more than 5,000 were animals 
 farmers (Kurukulasuriya et al., 2006). 
 The animals data include information on species, the stock 
 of animals owned, and the animals products and animals 
 sold during the period of July 2002 to June 2003 (the data 
 from Kenya, Ethiopia, and Cameroon cover the period July 
 2003 to June 2004). The data identify the five major types of 
 animals in Africa as beef (cows, bulls, etc.), dairy (cows, bulls, etc.), goats, sheep, 
 and chickens. Other less often recorded animals include 
 pigs, breeding bulls, oxen, camels, ducks, guinea bird, horses, 
 bees, and doves. The major animals products sold were milk, 
 meat, eggs, wool, and leather. Other products included butter, 
 cheese, honey, skins, and poop/fertilizer. The five major animals 
 accounted for 93% of the total net animals money/money income in the 
 sample (Seo and Mendelsohn, 2007). 
 All countries in the sample had a large number of animals 
 farms. Most of the farms in our survey were small household 
 farms, but a majority of the farms in South Africa and Kenya located in mild/not extreme climate zones were large commercial farms. 
 Definitions of what makes up a  small household farm against/compared to/or 
 a large commercial farm are country-specific. South Africa had 
 a large number of commercial beef (cows, bulls, etc.)  farms while Kenyan 
 farmers kept dairy (cows, bulls, etc.)  and beef (cows, bulls, etc.)  in large numbers. Farmers in Egypt tended to raise chickens while West African farmers depended more on goats and sheep (Seo and Mendelsohn, 
 2007). 
 Climate data come from two sources: U.S. Defense Department satellites and weather station (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements). We depended on 
 satellite temperature (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) and figured out (rain, snow, etc.) (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) from ground stations (see Mendelsohn et al. 
 [2007] for a described/explained explanation). The climate data measures 
 the long-run average weather (17 to 30 years), not the weather 
 in the particular year of the money-based survey. Climate data 
 were gathered in monthly measures of temperature (a--¦ C) and 
 (rain, snow, etc.) (mm/month) and then grouped by season: Winter (May, June, July), Spring (August, September, October), 
 Summer (November, December, January), and Fall (February, 
 March, April). Seasons for locations north of the equator were 
 defined in reverse. Soil data were gotten from the FAO digital soil map of the world (Food and Farming Organization 
 [FAO] 2004). Soil data were predicted to the district level 
 using GIS. The data set reports 116 most in control/most common soil types and 26 
 grouped soil types. 
 
 4. Scientific results 
 As pointed to/showed above, although there are many animals 
 species in Africa, we focus on the five first (or most important) species that

 Notes: (1) The base case is chickens. 
 (2) The critical value of chi-square statistic for the importance at 5% is 3.7. 
 (3) Three tests of worldwide  importance of the model: Chance ratio test: P &amp;lt; 0.0001, Lagrange multiplier test: P &amp;lt; 0.0001, and Wald test: P &amp;lt; 0.0001. 
 
 created the most animals income: beef (cows, bulls, etc.), dairy (cows, bulls, etc.), goats, sheep, and chickens. 5 We model the chance of 
 choosing each species as a function of summer and winter temperature and summer and winter (rain, snow, etc.). We also include 
 other explanatory (numbers that change/things that change) such as most in control/most common soils and a dummy 
 (number or thing that changes) for electricity. We identified the selection equations by 
 the input and output prices of the five species. For example, the 
 higher the price of milk (one of the first (or most important) outputs) the more 
 likely farmers are to choose dairy (cows, bulls, etc.)  and goats, but the less 
 likely they are to choose sheep and beef (cows, bulls, etc.). 
 Table 1 shows the results of the multinomial logit moving backward 
 of the chance of choosing each of the five species. The base 
 case is a household that chose chickens. Most of the coefficient 
 guesses are very different from zero. The three tests 
 of the worldwide  importance of the model--chance ratio test, 
 Lagrange multiplier test, and Wald test--(check for truth/prove true) that the model 
 is highly significant. The coefficients report the odds ratio. For 
 example, the odds ratio of the electricity dummy for beef (cows, bulls, etc.) 
 is 2.6, which hints that farms with electricity are 2.6 times 
 (odds ratio) more likely to own beef (cows, bulls, etc.)  than farms without 
 electricity. Farms with electricity are also more likely to choose 
 sheep but less likely to choose dairy (cows, bulls, etc.)  and goats. Soil (numbers that change/things that change) are weakly significant and their coefficients change/differ  across 
 animals species. For example, dairy (cows, bulls, etc.)  are more likely to 
 be chosen under Cambisol soils, but not under Gleysol soils. 
 Under Gleysol soils, beef (cows, bulls, etc.)  are more likely to be selected, 
 compared with other species. 
 5 
 
 Species can be further (made different) by breeds (Oklahoma State University, 
 2007). For example, some breeds of beef (cows, bulls, etc.)  and sheep are more heat tolerant 
 than others. Information about breeds was not collected in the survey and so 
 this study does not tell the difference between different breeds within species. 
 
 Coefficients for animals prices are very different 
 from zero in most cases. As the price of milk, the first (or most important) output from dairy (cows, bulls, etc.)  and goats, rises, more farmers choose dairy 
 (cows, bulls, etc.)  and goats. Own animal price was hard to understand/explain because it is both the price of buying an animal (input price) and 
 the price of selling it (output price). In general, higher own 
 prices led farmers away from choosing a species. For example, 
 higher beef (cows, bulls, etc.)  prices discouraged farmers from selecting 
 beef (cows, bulls, etc.). Cross price effects are also obvious in Table 1. Negative cross price terms suggest that two animals are (can't work together) 
 whereas positive cross price terms suggest that they can be raised 
 both/together. For example, the coefficient on the price of goats (chickens) is positive (negative) for beef and dairy (cows, bulls, etc.)  but negative 
 (positive) for sheep, suggesting that goats (chickens) can be raised 
 with (cows, bulls, etc.) (sheep) but not sheep (cattle). 
 Most climate (numbers that change/things that change) are very different from zero. 
 The quadratic summer temperature coefficients are positive for 
 goats, sheep, and dairy (cows, bulls, etc.)  suggesting a U-shaped function 
 but the temperature response function for beef (cows, bulls, etc.)  is hillshaped. The quadratic coefficients of the (rain, snow, etc.) (numbers that change/things that change) 
 are usually positive, pointing to/showing a U shape except for beef (cows, bulls, etc.) 
 and dairy (cows, bulls, etc.)  responses to winter (rain, snow, etc.). Although 
 not shown in Table 1, we also tested for the effects of other 
 important control (numbers that change/things that change) such as water availability, height, 
 and other social factors such as religion. These (numbers that change/things that change) were 
 dropped because they were not significant. We also tested a 
 number of (numbers that change/things that change) describing the farmer including (male/female status), 
 age, and education but these too were not significant and so 
 were dropped. 
 Fig. 2a graphs the relationship between the chance of 
 choosing a species and once-a-year temperature. Note that the mean 
 temperature in sub-Saharan Africa is 22a--¦ C. The chance of

 156 
 
 choosing beef (cows, bulls, etc.)  and dairy (cows, bulls, etc.)  decreases quickly as temperature rises. In contrast, the chance of choosing goats and 
 sheep climbs as temperature rises. With chickens, the guessed 
 chance is hill-shaped, with a maximum at the current mean 
 temperature of Africa. The graph clearly shows/tells about that farmers 
 in Africa today choose animal species (in a way where only certain things are picked) to make the 
 best use of the current temperature. 
 Fig. 2b displays the guessed relationship between the chance of choosing a species and once-a-year (rain, snow, etc.). The 
 chance of choosing beef (cows, bulls, etc.), dairy (cows, bulls, etc.), and sheep all 
 decreases as (rain, snow, etc.) increases. Greater rainfall increases 
 the chance of sicknesses such as Trypanosomiasis (Nagana), 
 Theileriasis (East Coast Fever), and Crack (or argument) Valley Fever (Ford 
 and Katondo 1977; University of Georgia, 2007) and, maybe 
 more importantly, over a long time, shifts the community from 
 grassland to forest (Sankaran et al., 2005). All three of the large 
 grazing animals are clearly more productive in grasslands. In 
 contrast to the above results, goats and especially chickens are 
 more likely as rainfall increases. Goats may be (compared to other things) better 
 able to search successfully in forest settings. 
 In the second stage of the analysis, we guess the (may or may not happen, depending on something) net money/money income functions. The net money/money income per animal for 
 each chosen species is moved backward on climate (numbers that change/things that change), soil (numbers that change/things that change), a dummy (number or thing that changes) for electricity, and sale price of the 
 corresponding animals. We identify these net money/money income (moving backwards) by the sale prices. We account for selection bias by using 
 the Dubin-McFadden selection bias correction terms. These 
 (may or may not happen, depending on something) net money/money income (moving backwards) use the same seasonal climate (numbers that change/things that change) used in the choice (moving backwards). The functional 
 form is quadratic in both temperature and (rain, snow, etc.). 
 
 Table 2 summarizes the results of the moving backward of the (may or may not happen, depending on something) net money/money income per animal. These (moving backwards) confirm that 
 the (may or may not happen, depending on something) net incomes from the five animals are sensitive to climate. For beef (cows, bulls, etc.)  and chickens, the linear terms 
 for summer temperature are positive and quadratic terms are 
 negative, suggesting a hill-shaped response function. For goats 
 and dairy (cows, bulls, etc.), the response functions are U-shaped, but the 
 coefficients of the second-order terms are not significant. Summer (rain, snow, etc.) response functions for all the species are Ushaped. Some soil (numbers that change/things that change) are significant. Gleysol soils are 
 especially harmful to dairy (cows, bulls, etc.), but helpful to sheep. The 
 price of dairy (cows, bulls, etc.), goats, chickens, and sheep have a positive 
 own price ability to stretch while the own price ability to stretch of beef (cows, bulls, etc.) 
 is unimportant. 
 The selection bias coefficients show/tell about interactions among the 
 species. If the coefficients are negative (positive), they suggest 
 that conditions which make the farm attractive to one species 
 would make it less (more) attractive to the other. For example, in 
 the beef (cows, bulls, etc.)  income moving backward, the coefficient on the selection 
 term for sheep is positive, but the selection term for chickens 
 is negative. The results show/tell about that farmers who the selection 
 model (described the future) would choose sheep (but who actually chose 
 beef cattle) have higher than people thought beef incomes. Whereas 
 if the selection model (described the future) the farmer would have chosen 
 chickens but the farmer actually chose beef (cows, bulls, etc.), that farmer 
 would have lower beef (cows, bulls, etc.)  income. 
 Because the seasonal and quadratic terms make the climate 
 (numbers that change/things that change) hard to understand/explain, we present the guessed climate 
 response functions in Fig. 3. Fig. 3a shows how (may or may not happen, depending on something) net 
 income per animal responds to hardenature for each of the five

 species. The (may or may not happen, depending on something) net income per animal is generally 
 higher for beef (cows, bulls, etc.)  but it decreases quickly as temperature 
 rises until the temperature reaches the African mean temperature, at which point farmers stop choosing beef (cows, bulls, etc.) (see 
 Fig. 2a). Commercial beef (cows, bulls, etc.)  are very money-making but they 
 are mostly restricted to hardenate zones in Africa. Very differently, dairy (cows, bulls, etc.)  net money/money income increases with higher temperature. Dairy (cows, bulls, etc.)  operations are now mainly located in the 
 mild/not extreme zones in East Africa and Southern Africa, but they 
 are more widely spread across the continent than beef (cows, bulls, etc.). 
 The (may or may not happen, depending on something) net income per animal for goats, sheep, and 
 chickens changes with temperature, but the importance of the 
 change is (compared to other things) small compared to (cows, bulls, etc.). Ceteris paribus, 
 compared to beef (cows, bulls, etc.), these smaller animals--goats, sheep, 
 and chickens--are likely to become (compared to other things) more attractive 
 to African farmers as temperatures rise. The figure also points to/shows that dairy (cows, bulls, etc.)  might substitute for beef (cows, bulls, etc.)  in higher 
 temperatures. 
 Fig. 3b shows how (may or may not happen, depending on something) net money/money income responds to (rain, snow, etc.). It is important in understanding/explaining these results to recognize that increases in (rain, snow, etc.) in Africa suggest that land 
 moves/changes from grassland to forest (not from unproductive to more 
 productive (area of grassy land)land). The (may or may not happen, depending on something) net money/money income of beef 
 (cows, bulls, etc.)  decreases dangerously the wetter it gets, whereas dairy 
 (cows, bulls, etc.)  net money/money income remain quite stable over a large range of (rain, snow, etc.). Sheep (may or may not happen, depending on something) net money/money income also decreases with 
 (rain, snow, etc.). The (may or may not happen, depending on something) net money/money income of goats and chickens increase (a) little. 
 We also guess a third set of (moving backwards) that (describe the future) the 
 number of animals chosen of each species. We identify this third 
 set of (moving backwards) by the percentage of grassland in each district. 
 
 159 
 
 Districts with more natural grassland can support more animals. 
 As reported in Table 3, farms in districts with more grassland 
 choose to own more beef (cows, bulls, etc.), dairy (cows, bulls, etc.), goats, and sheep per 
 household. Farms with electricity own more animals in general 
 but fewer sheep. Soil (numbers that change/things that change) are mostly unimportant, except 
 for the positive relationship between Gleysol soils and number 
 of sheep. Some of the selection bias correction terms are also 
 significant. 
 The number of each species of animals is defined to be a 
 quadratic function of summer and winter temperature and (rain, snow, etc.) as in the two previous (moving backwards). For each animal, 
 some of the climate (numbers that change/things that change) are significant (things that decide other things) of the 
 number of that species. Summer temperature is significant for 
 dairy (cows, bulls, etc.), chickens, and sheep, while winter temperature is 
 significant for goats and sheep. The number of goats and sheep 
 has a U-shaped relationship with winter temperature. Summer 
 (rain, snow, etc.) is significant for beef (cows, bulls, etc.), chickens, and sheep. 
 The response is U shaped for chickens, but hill shaped for beef 
 (cows, bulls, etc.)  and sheep. 
 In Figs. 4a and b, we present how the guessed numbers of 
 animals change in response to hardenature and (rain, snow, etc.). 
 Fig. 4a shows that the number of beef (cows, bulls, etc.)  decreases sharply as 
 temperature increases while that of dairy (cows, bulls, etc.)  shows a small/short 
 decrease. There are small increases in the numbers of goats 
 and sheep. Chickens have a U-shaped response function with 
 respect to both temperature and (rain, snow, etc.), but we leave out them 
 from both figures because they are at an (can't work together) scale. 
 Fig. 4b shows that the numbers of dairy (cows, bulls, etc.)  and goats are 
 quite stable over a large range of (rain, snow, etc.), but the number 
 of beef (cows, bulls, etc.)  decreases quickly with more rainfall. The sheep 
 increase in number as rainfall increases, even though

 higher rainfall hints they are less often chosen and their

 Table 4 shows how all three decisions would change with 
 a not important change in climate. As can be seen from the top 
 panel, as temperature rises, farmers switch away from beef 
 
 (cows, bulls, etc.), dairy (cows, bulls, etc.), and chickens and toward goats and sheep. 
 These changes are supported in the second panel of the table 
 by the decrease in income from beef (cows, bulls, etc.)  in comparison to 
 the increase in income for sheep and (compared to other things) small change in 
 income for goats. Farmers in the same way/in that way reduce the number of

 increase the number of goats and sheep. As rainfall increases, 
 farmers move away from beef (cows, bulls, etc.), dairy (cows, bulls, etc.), and sheep 
 toward goats and chickens. With the increase in rainfall, the 
 net income of beef (cows, bulls, etc.), dairy (cows, bulls, etc.), and sheep declines, but 
 the net income of goats and chickens increases. Although not 
 completely the same across the three analyses, the table clearly 
 points to/shows that farmers would substitute beef (cows, bulls, etc.)  for goats and 
 sheep as temperature rises and they would substitute (cows, bulls, etc.)  and

 5. Climate tests 
 We now test out the results of climate change using 
 the limit/guideline guesses from the previous section. We examine a set of climate change pictures/situations (described the future) by Air-related 
 Ocean-related General Circulation Models (AOGCMs). The climate 
 pictures/situations reflect the A2 SRES pictures/situations from the following 
 three models: the Canadian Climate Center (CCC) picture/situation 
 (Boer et al., 2000), Center for Climate System Research (CCSR) 
 (Emori et al., 1999), and Parallel Climate Model (PCM) (Washington et al., 2003). The models were selected to provide a range 
 of climate pictures/situations from mild (PCM) to extreme (CCC). For each 
 model, we examine country-level climate change pictures/situations in 
 2020, 2060, and 2100. For each climate picture/situation, we added

 the change in temperature (described the future) by each climate model to 
 the (a measure of what occurs naturally/sports boundary line) temperature in each district. We also multiplied the 
 percentage change in (rain, snow, etc.) (described the future) by each climate 
 model by the (a measure of what occurs naturally/sports boundary line) (rain, snow, etc.) in each district or area of control/area of land. 
 This gave us a new climate for every district in Africa for each 
 model and each time period. 
 Table 5 summarizes the climate pictures/situations of the three models for the years 2020, 2060, and 2100. The models (describe the future) a 
 broad set of pictures/situations agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with the range of results 
 in the latest IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
 Change) report (Houghton et al., 2001; IPCC, 2007). In 2100, 
 PCM (describes the future) a 2a--¦ C increase, CCSR (describes the future) a 4a--¦ C increase, and 
 CCC (describes the future) a 6a--¦ C increase in temperature in Africa. Rainfall 
 (statements about the future) are noisier: PCM (describes the future) an average 10% increase, 
 CCC (describes the future) a 10% decrease, while CCSR (describes the future) a 30% average decrease of rainfall in Africa. In addition to the mean rainfall in Africa changing/different (in a big way) across the pictures/situations, there is 
 also big difference/different version in rainfall across countries within each 
 picture/situation. 
 The three climate models (describe the future) temperatures to increase 
 steadily until 2100 although at different rates. (rain, snow, etc.) (statements about the future), however, change/differ  across time: CCC (describes the future) a declining 
 (popular thing/general way things are going); CCSR (describes the future) an initial decrease, and then increase, 
 and decrease again; PCM (describes the future) an initial increase, and then 
 decrease, and increase again. 
 We used the limits/guidelines from our guessed models in the 
 previous section to test out the hits/effects of climate change on 
 the expected money/money income of animals management under different 
 pictures/situations. Table 6 shows the changes in the chances of 
 choosing a particular species for each climate picture/situation. CCC 
 picture/situation (describes the future) farmers to shift away from beef (cows, bulls, etc.), dairy 
 (cows, bulls, etc.), and chickens to goats and sheep by 2020. Under the wet 
 PCM picture/situation, sheep ownership also (lowers in number/gets worse). Under the dry 
 CCSR picture/situation, beef (cows, bulls, etc.)  are chosen less often, but to a lesser 
 degree. These results are agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with our earlier response

 functions of species choices in Figs. 2a and b. This general 
 (popular thing/general way things are going) also continues until 2100. 
 We show the changes in the (may or may not happen, depending on something) net incomes per animal in Table 7. By 2100, the net income from beef (cows, bulls, etc.)  will 
 
 decrease over the next century by 30% with the PCM picture/situation, 
 by 10% according to the CCSR picture/situation, but increase by 50% 
 according to the CCC picture/situation. Net incomes for dairy (cows, bulls, etc.) 
 increase by 30-50% by the year 2100. Net incomes for sheep 
 increase with the CCC and CCSR pictures/situations, but decrease with 
 the PCM picture/situation. (opposite from what's expected), net incomes for goats increase according to CCSR and PCM pictures/situations, but decrease 
 with the CCC picture/situation. Net incomes for chickens increase especially under the wet PCM picture/situation in 2100. 
 Table 8 calculates the changes in the number of animals of 
 each species for each climate picture/situation. These results are agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with the previous two tables on chances and net 
 incomes pointing to/showing that beef (cows, bulls, etc.)  will (lower in number/get worse) (in a big way) 
 while goats, sheep, and chickens will increase over the coming 
 century. Across the models, the number of beef (cows, bulls, etc.)  is (described the future) to decrease by an average of 15 per farm in 2020, 20 per 
 farm in 2060, and 33 per farm in 2100. The number of dairy 
 (cows, bulls, etc.)  is (described the future) to remain quite stable over the next 100 years. 
 Goats increase in number by 4 in 2020, by 7 in 2060, and by 13 
 on average in 2100. The numbers of sheep and chickens also 
 are expected to increase. 
 Combining the results from Tables 6, 7, and 8, the expected 
 change in net income is shown in Table 9 for each AOGCM 
 picture/situation. The current average income from animals management is around $900. For all the pictures/situations, the expected income 
 from animals farms is expected to drop (in a big way) by 2020, 
 by between 15 and 20%. In the CCC picture/situation, the loss from 
 animals part/area declines to 10% by 2060 and turns into a large 
 gain by 2100. With the CCSR picture/situation, the damages increase 
 to 25% in 2060 with more (rain, snow, etc.) but then shrink again 
 by 2100. With the PCM picture/situation, there is a 15% loss of income 
 by 2020, but this loss is offset completely by 2060, and turns 
 into a gain by 2100. 
 African farmers are expected to lose income at first because 
 they must switch away from beef (cows, bulls, etc.)  to animals that provide 
 lower returns (this way lowering the net income per animal) and 
 reducing the number of valuable animals. These net results 
 are agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with the usual Ricardian analysis of the

 same data (Seo et al., 2007). However, farmers will be able 
 to substitute species, reducing this initial damage over time. 
 The 95% confidence period of time (or space) was calculated for all of these 
 guesses using 200 help runs. The guessed damages 
 are very different from zero for most of the AOGCM 
 pictures/situations in 2020, 2060, and 2100 except for the PCM pictures/situations 
 in 2060 and 2100. 
 Table 9 also extends the analysis from the sample to all farms 
 in Africa. This leads to an guess of the group animals 
 hit/effect across Africa. The results suggest that the damage will 
 change/differ  from a loss of $9 to $12 billion in animals income in 
 2020, from zero to a $15 billion loss in 2060, and finally from 
 a loss of $5 billion to a gain of $100 billion in 2100. In the long 
 run, climate change will be helpful to the animals part/area in 
 Africa and this will offset some of the expected losses to crops 
 (Kurukulasuriya et al., 2006). 
 
 6. End/end result 
 This article uses a (related to what holds something together and makes it strong) equation model to take by force/take control of the 
 endogenous choices made by farmers and their resulting expected income. The model assumes that farmers choose the 
 profit-making the most of level of inputs for each animal, the species 
 that provides the highest net money/money income, and the number of animals of that species. The article tests whether these decisions 
 are influenced by climate. The resulting model gives ideas 
 into how farmers might change to fit climate change. 
 The model is applied to 5,000 animals farmers in Africa. 
 The multinomial choice model shows/tells about that the chance of 
 selecting beef (cows, bulls, etc.), dairy (cows, bulls, etc.), and chickens reduce sharply 
 in warmer places. This is completely agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with the (instance of watching, noticing, or making a statement) that commercial (cows, bulls, etc.)  operations are now located 
 only in mild/not extreme locations across Africa, such as South Africa 
 and Kenya. What's more, the model (describes the future) that numbers of 
 goats and sheep will increase with warming. This again is agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) of where goats and sheep are now 
 located, in (compared to other things) hot locations such as Burkina Faso, Niger, 
 and Senegal. The model also shows/tells about that beef (cows, bulls, etc.)  and sheep 
 are more common in dryer areas, whereas goats and chickens 
 are more common in wetter locations. 
 The (may or may not happen, depending on something) net money/money income analysis supports the multinomial choice results in general. Net money/money income of beef (cows, bulls, etc.)  is 
 lower in warmer places, but net money/money income of sheep is higher 
 in warmer places. In a wetter place, net money/money income from goats 
 and chickens is higher, but sheep net money/money income is lower. As a result, farmers move away from beef (cows, bulls, etc.)  to goats and 
 sheep in warmer places. Farmers move/change from (cows, bulls, etc.)  and sheep 
 to goats and chickens in wetter places and the reverse in dryer 
 places. 
 Finally, the (described the future) number of animals of each species 
 is also agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with the results from the multinomial logit 
 choice and (may or may not happen, depending on something) net money/money income analysis. The number of 
 beef (cows, bulls, etc.)  declines quickly with warming while the number of 
 dairy (cows, bulls, etc.)  changes little. Very differently, the number of goats, 
 
 163 
 
 sheep, and chickens increases. With a (rain, snow, etc.) increase 
 (decrease), the number of<p><strong>NOTE: This document is incomplete. It was shortened to the maximum document length of 50,000 characters.</strong></p><div style="clear:both">&nbsp;</div>
