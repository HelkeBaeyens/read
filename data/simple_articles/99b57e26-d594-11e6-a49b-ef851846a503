 Abstract 
 Technical, allocative and money-based (wasting very little while working or producing something) measures are received/made from for a sample of swine producers in Hawaii using the 
 parametric (random/including random data points) (wasting very little while working or producing something) rotting way of doing things and nonparametric data envelopment analysis (DEA). (wasting very little while working or producing something) 
 measures received/got from the two edge of something/unexplored area approaches are compared. Firm-clearly stated/particular factors affecting productive (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) are 
 also carefully studied. Finally, swine producers' (possibility of/possible happening of)  reducing cost through improved (wasting very little while working or producing something) is also examined. Under the 
 (detailed description of exactly what is required) of (number or thing that changes) returns to scale (VRS), the mean technical, allocative and money-based (wasting very little while working or producing something) indices are 75.9%, 
 75.8% and 57.1%, (match up each pair of items in order), for the paramettic approach and 75.9%, 80.3% and 60.3% for DEA; while for the constant 
 returns to scale (CRS) they are 74.5%, 73.9% and 54.7%, (match up each pair of items in order), for the parametric approach and 64.3%, 71.4% and 
 45.7% for DEA. This way the results from both approaches show/tell about (large/relatively large) inefficiencies in swine production in Hawaii. The 
 removal of possible (things that aren't part of the main group) increases the technical (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) in the parametric approach and allocative (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) in DEA, 
 but, overall, opposite to popular belief, the results received/got from DEA are found to be more strong than those from the 
 parametric approach. The guessed mean technical and money-based (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) received/got from the paramettic way of doing things are 
 higher than those from DEA for CRS models but quite almost the same  for VRS models, while allocative (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) are usually 
 higher in DEA. However, the (wasting very little while working or producing something) rankings of the sample producers based on the two approaches are highly related, 
 with the highest relationship being (accomplished or gained) for the technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) rankings under CRS. Based on mean compaiison and 
 rank relationship analyses, the return to scale idea (you think is true) is found to be important in testing the (things that are almost the same as other things) or differences in 
 (wasting very little while working or producing something) measures received/got from the two approaches. Analysis of the role of different firm-clearly stated/particular factors on productive 
 (wasting very little while working or producing something) shows that farm size has strong positive effects on (wasting very little while working or producing something) levels. (in almost the same way), farms producing market hogs are 
 (producing more with less waste) than those producing feeder pigs. Based on these results, by operating at the (producing a lot with very little waste) edge of something/unexplored area the sample swine 
 producers would be able to reduce their production costs by 38-46% depending upon the method and returns to scale 
 carefully thought about/believed. Â© 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

 Farrell's (Farrell, 1957) important article has led to 
 the development of a few ways of doing things for the mea*Conesponding author. Tel.: +1-808-956-4976; fax: +1-808956-2811; e-mail: khem@hawaii.edu 
 
 surement of (wasting very little while working or producing something) of production. These ways of doing things can be broadly labeled into two approaches: 
 parametric and nonparametric. The parametric (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area production function approach (Aigner 
 et al., 1977; Meeusen and van den Broeck, 1977) and 
 the nonparametric mathematical programming 
 approach, commonly referred to as data envelopment

 analysis (DEA) (Chames et al., 1978) are the two most 
 popular ways of doing things used in (wasting very little while working or producing something) analyses. 
 Among many authors, Coelli (1995) presents the 
 latest review of different ways of doing things used in 
 (wasting very little while working or producing something) measurement, including their limits, 
 strengths and applications in farming-based production. 
 The main strengths of the (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area approach 
 are that it deals with (random/including random data points) noise and permits 
 (related to studying numbers) tests of guesses having to do with production 
 structure and the degree of inefficiency. The need for 
 (impressive/forcing (on people)/causing an inconvenient situation) an clear parametric form for the hidden (under) technology and an clear distributional 
 idea (you think is true) for the inefficiency term are the main 
 weaknesses of the parametric approach. The main 
 advantages of the DEA approach are that it avoids 
 parametric (detailed description of exactly what is required) of technology as well as the 
 distributional idea (you think is true) for the inefficiency term. 
 However, because DEA is pre-decided and attributes 
 all the mistakes from the edge of something/unexplored area to inefficiencies, a 
 edge of something/unexplored area guessed by DEA is likely to be sensitive to 
 measurement errors or other noise in the data. 
 Given the different strengths and weaknesses of the 
 parametric and nonparametric approaches, it is of 
 interest to compare scientific performance of the 
 two approaches using the same data set. However, 
 relative to the total number offrontier studies found in 
 the books, very few studies compare the two 
 approaches (for example, Ferrier and Lovell, 1990; 
 Kalaitzandonakes and Dunn, 1995; Drake and Weyman-Jones, 1996; Hjalmarsson et al., 1996; Sharma et 
 al., 1997a). The main goal of this paper is to 
 guess the technical, allocative and money-based (wasting very little while working or producing something) measures for a sample of swine producers in 
 Hawaii using the parametric (random/including random data points) and nonparametric DEA approaches, and to compare the results 
 received/got from the two approaches. Most 
 studies aimed at comparing the two ways of doing things have 
 focused mostly on technical (wasting very little while working or producing something). Drake and 
 Weyman-Jones (1996) and Ferrier and Lovell 
 (1990) are the only studies comparing the two 
 approaches in terms of technical, allocative and money-based (wasting very little while working or producing something) measures. Because DEA has not 
 been applied often in farming (see Coelli, 
 1995), this paper also (shows or proves) its (ability to be used for something) 
 in farming by using this way of doing things in swine production. To our knowledge, Chavas and Aliber (1993) 
 is the only study carefully studying technical, allocative and 
 money-based (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) in farming using DEA. 
 
 This paper extends on an earlier paper in comparing 
 (random/including random data points) and DEA edge of something/unexplored area analyses of a sample of 
 swine producers in Hawaii (Sharma et al., 1997a). The 
 earlier paper mostly focused on the analysis of 
 output-based technical (wasting very little while working or producing something). In this study, we 
 apply the input-based approach to (wasting very little while working or producing something) measurement and extend our analysis to allocative and overall 
 money-based (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste). The role of different firm-clearly stated/particular factors in productive (wasting very little while working or producing something) not thought about/believed in 
 our earlier paper is also examined here. 
 
 2. (related to careful studying or deep thinking) (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) 
 2.1. Parametric approach 
 As in Bravo-Ureta and Evenson (1994) and BravoUreta and Rieger (1991), the parametric way of doing things 
 used in this paper follows the Kopp and Diewert 
 (1982) cost rotting procedure to guess technical, allocative and money-based (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste). 
 The firm's technology is represented by a (random/including random data points) 
 production edge of something/unexplored area as follows: 
 (1) 
 
 where li represents output of the ith firm; X; is a vector 
 of functions of actual input amounts used by 
 the ith firm; (3 is a vector of limits/guidelines to be guessed; and Ei is the (made up of different things) error term (Aigner 
 et al., 1977; Meeusen and van den Broeck, 1977) 
 defined as 
 (2) 
 
 where v;s are assumed to be independently and identically distributed N(O, O";) random errors, independent of the u;s; and the u;s are nonnegative random 
 (numbers that change/things that change), connected with technical inefficiency in 
 production, which are assumed to be independently 
 and identically distributed and cutting offs (at zero) of 
 the (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) distribution with mean, f.1, and variance, 
 O"&#126;([N(J.L, O"&#126;[). The maximum chance guess of 
 Eq. (1) provides estimators for (3 and variance limits/guidelines, 0"2 = O"; + O"&#126; and '"Y = O"&#126;/ 0"2 . Subtracting v; 
 from both sides of Eq. (1) yields 
 
 Y; = Y; 
 
 -Vi 
 
 = f(Xi; (3) - 
 
 U; 
 
 (3) 
 
 where Y; is the watched/followed output of the ith firm, 
 (changed to make better/changed to fit new conditions) for the (random/including random data points) noise (taken/took by force)/(taken/took control of) by v;. 
 
 K.R. Shamm et al./ Farming-based Money flow 20 (1999) 23-35 
 
 Bq. (3) is the basis for getting/taking the technically (producing a lot with very little waste) input vector and for (in a way when you carefully examine something) getting/taking the 
 dual cost edge of something/unexplored area of the production function represented by Bq. (1). 
 For a given level of output Y;, the technically 
 (producing a lot with very little waste) input vector for the ith firm, Xf, is received/made from 
 by (at the same time) solving Bq. (3) and the input ratios 
 XJ/X; = k;(i &amp;gt; 1), where k; is the ratio of watched/followed 
 inputs, X 1 and X;. Assuming that the production 
 function in Bq. (1) is self-dual (e.g., Cobb-Douglas), 
 the dual cost edge of something/unexplored area can be received/made from math-relatedally and 
 written in a general form as follows: 
 C; 
 
 = h(W;, Y;; a) 
 
 (4) 
 
 where C; is the minimum cost of the ith firm connected 
 with output Y;, W; is a vector of input prices for the ith 
 firm, and a is a vector of limits/guidelines. The (money-based)/cheaply (producing a lot with very little waste) input vector for the ith firm, X'f, is received/made from 
 by applying Shephard's lemma and substituting the 
 firm's input prices and output level into the resulting 
 system of input demand equations: 
 
 ac; 
 
 - 
 
 oWk = XZ(W;, Y;; '1/J) 
 
 k = 1, 2, ... , m inputs

 Following Farrell (1957), the allocative (wasting very little while working or producing something) 
 (AB) index can be came/coming from Bqs. (6) and (7) as 
 follows:

 2.2. Nonparametric approach 
 
 Under the nonparametric approach, DBA (Charnes 
 et al., 1978; Hire et al., 1985, 1994) is used to get 
 technical, scale, allocative and money-based (wasting very little while working or producing something) 
 measures. 
 Think about/believe the situation with n firms or decision 
 making units (DMUs), each producing a single output 
 by using m different inputs. Here, Y; is the output 
 produced and X; is the (mx 1) vector of inputs used by 
 the ith DMU. Yis the (1 xn) vector of outputs and X is 
 the (mxn) matrix of inputs of all n DMUs in the 
 sample. W; is the (mx 1) vector of input prices for the 
 ith DMU. 
 The technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) (TB) measure under constant returns to scale (CRS), also called the 'overall' 
 TB measure, is received/got by solving the following DBA 
 model: 
 
 subject to 
 
 Y; :::; Y .A 
 
 &amp;gt; x.&amp;gt;. 
 8cRsx. 
 l 
 ,_ 
 (9) 
 
 where '1/J is a vector of limits/guidelines. The watched/followed, 
 technically (producing a lot with very little waste) and (money-based)/cheaply (producing a lot with very little waste) costs 
 of production of the ith firm are equal to W[X;, W[Xf 
 and W[X'f, (match up each pair of items in order). These cost measures are used 
 to figure out/calculate  technical (TB) and money-based (BB) (wasting very little while working or producing something) indices for the ith firm as follows: 
 
 BE-=-'-' 
 
 25 
 
 where BfRS is a TB measure of the ith DMU under 
 CRS and .A is an n x 1 vector of weights attached to 
 each of the (producing a lot with very little waste) DMUs. A separate linear programming (LP) problem is solved to get the TB 
 score for each of the n DMUs in the sample. If 
 ecRs=1, the DMU is on the edge of something/unexplored area and is technically 
 (producing a lot with very little waste) under CRS. If ecRs&amp;lt;1, then the DMU lies 
 below the edge of something/unexplored area and is technically inefficient. Under 
 CRS DBA, the technically (producing a lot with very little waste) cost of production 
 of the ith DMU is given by W{(BfRSX;). 
 In order to get a measure of the total money-based 
 (wasting very little while working or producing something) (BB) index, one can solve the following 
 cost-(making small) DBA model (Hire et al., 1985, 1994)

 This way the total cost or money-based inefficiency of the 
 ith firm (W[X;- W[Xi) can be rotten into its 
 technical (WX{;- WXf{) and allocative (WfXf- WfXi) 
 parts/pieces.

 where X7 is the cost-(making small) or (money-based)/cheaply 
 (producing a lot with very little waste) input vector for the ith DMU, given its input 
 price vector, W;, and the output level, Y;. The total or

 overall money-based (wasting very little while working or producing something) (EE) index for the ith firm 
 is then figured out/calculated as 
 W'X* 
 EE=-i_i 
 
 ' 
 
 W[X; 
 
 (11) 
 
 which is the ratio of the minimum cost to the watched/followed 
 cost and just like the money-based (wasting very little while working or producing something) index 
 received/made from under the parametric approach Eq. (7). The 
 allocative (wasting very little while working or producing something) (AE) index, came/coming from 
 Eqs. (9) and (11), is given by 
 AE = EE, _ 
 , e;Rs 
 
 W[X7 
 
 w; (efRs X;) 
 
 (12) 
 
 It should be noted that Eq. (10) also accounts 
 for input slacks not (taken/took by force)/(taken/took control of) by Eq. (9) above. Following Ferrier and Lovell (1990) this procedure 
 attributes any input slacks to allocative inefficiency 
 on the grounds that slack reflects an inappropriate 
 input mix. 1 
 The CRS or 'overall' (TEcRs) measure can be 
 rotten into its 'pure' TE and scale (wasting very little while working or producing something) 
 parts/pieces by solving a changeable returns to scale 
 (VRS) DEA model, which is received/got by (impressive/forcing (on people)/causing an inconvenient situation) 
 the added/more restriction, '2:&#126;= 1 Aj = 1 on Eq. (9) 
 (Banker et al., 1984). Let B'(RS represent the TE index 
 of the ith DMU under (number or thing that changes) returns to scale 
 (TEvRs), then the technically (producing a lot with very little waste) cost of production of the ith DMU under VRS DEA is equal to 
 
 W[(B'(R 8 X;). 
 Because the VRS analysis is more flexible and 
 surrounds the data in a tighter way than the CRS 
 analysis, the VRS TE measure (BvRs) is equal to or 
 greater than the CRS measure (BcRs). This relationship is used to get a measure of scale (wasting very little while working or producing something) 
 (SE) of the ith DMU as 2 
 
 BCRS 
 SE; = e&#126;Rs 
 
 (13) 
 
 l 
 
 where SE= 1 points to/shows scale (wasting very little while working or producing something) or CRS and SE 
 &amp;lt;1 points to/shows scale inefficiency. Scale inefficiency is 
 
 1Some authors have treated slack as a source of technical 
 inefficiency (see Ali and Seiford, 1993). 
 2 Or, SE can also be figured out/calculated as EEcRs/EEvRs, where 
 EECRs is the total money-based or cost (wasting very little while working or producing something) measure under CRS 
 and EEVRS is the similar measure for VRS (Chavas and 
 Aliber, 1993; Lund eta!., 1993). 
 
 due to the presence of either increasing or decreasing 
 returns to scale, which can be figured out by/decided by solving a 
 nonincreasing returns to scale (NIRS) DEA model 
 which is received/got by substituting the VRS restriction 
 '2:;=1 Aj = 1 with l:j'=1 Aj ::::; 1. Let eNIRS represent the 
 TE measure under nonincreasing returns to scale. If

 eNIRS = eCRS , there are mcreasmg 
 . 
 1'f BCRS &amp;lt;BNIRS there are decreasmg 
 returns to sea1e 
 (Hire et al., 1994). 
 As in the parametric case, the total cost or money-based 
 inefficiency of the ith firm (W[X;- W[X;) can be

 2.3. Deciding/figuring out factors affecting (wasting very little while working or producing something) 
 Analysis of the effects of firm-clearly stated/particular factors on 
 productive (wasting very little while working or producing something) has created large amounts of 
 debate in edge of something/unexplored area studies. The most popular procedure 
 is to first estimate (wasting very little while working or producing something) scores and then to move backward 
 them against a set of firm-clearly stated/particular factors or to use 
 nonparametric or analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests. 
 While Kalirajan (1991) and Ray (1988) defend this 
 two-step procedure, other authors (Kumbhakar et al., 
 1991; Battese and Coelli, 1995) challenge this 
 approach by arguing that firm-clearly stated/particular factors should 
 be incorporated directly in the guess of the 
 production edge of something/unexplored area because such factors may have a 
 direct hit/effect on (wasting very little while working or producing something). (even though there is the existence of) such criticism, the 
 two-step procedure is still quite popular in (asking lots of questions about/trying to find the truth about) the relationship between (wasting very little while working or producing something) and firm-clearly stated/particular (numbers that change/things that change). 
 Existing studies aiming to incorporate firm-specific 
 effects directly into the edge of something/unexplored area model are limited to 
 the parametric approach (Kumbhakar et al., 1991; 
 Battese and Coelli, 1995). Without prior ideas (you think are true) 
 on whether the firm-clearly stated/particular factors have a positive or 
 bad effect on money-based performance (see, for 
 example, Ferrier and Lovell, 1990), the nonparametric 
 DEA way of doing things cannot easily incorporate firm-specific 
 effects directly into the guess of an (producing a lot with very little waste) 
 edge of something/unexplored area. Because the two-step procedure is equally 
 related to both approaches, we put into use this 
 approach to carefully study the role of firm-clearly stated/particular factors 
 in the money-based (wasting very little while working or producing something) of swine producers in 
 Hawaii.

 3. Data and scientific procedures 
 3.1. Data 
 Data were collected from a sample of 53 commercial swine producers in Hawaii during the fall of 1994. 
 For the purpose of our study, farms with 10 or more 
 plants seed causes are carefully thought about/believed commercial producers. Of the 
 total of 350 swine farms in Hawaii, about 60% raise 
 swine commercially and the rest raise swine as a 
 hobby, for family consumption and for cultural reasons. The sample included about one-third of all 
 commercial swine producers in Hawaii. Information 
 on the distribution of farms and sample producers by 
 size and key (features/ qualities/ traits) can be found in Sharma et 
 al. (1997a, b). 
 Hawaii's pig-related industry has experienced a continuous decline over the last few years. The number of swine 
 farms decreased from 650 in 1985 to about 350 in 
 1994 and the once-a-year hog (amount or quantity of items stored now) decreased from 
 55 000 to 34 000 during this period. The (your share of sales out of all sales) 
 of local production decreased from 45% in 1970 to 
 13.4% in 1994. This decline, which is attributed to 
 high production costs, especially feed costs, price 
 competition with imported hogs, limited land availability, fast (city growth), and increasing (worries about the health of the Earth), has presented/caused serious challenges for 
 the long-term survival of this industry. 
 The analysis of costs and returns of the sample 
 producers showed a wide difference/different version in a money-making state, 
 with most of the sample producers, especially small 
 and medium producers, earning a negative net return 
 from swine production (Sharma et al., 1997b). This 
 raises the question of the role of productive (wasting very little while working or producing something) 
 in a money-making state. We believe that the future of the swine 
 producers in Hawaii will depend on their ability to 
 improve money-based performance through improved 
 productive (wasting very little while working or producing something). 
 3.2. Description of (numbers that change/things that change) 
 Pig-related production features many outputs and 
 inputs. For the purpose of (wasting very little while working or producing something) analysis, output 
 is grouped into one category and inputs are grouped into four categories, namely, feed, labor, other 
 (number or thing that changes) inputs and fixed input. Because hog prices 
 change/differ  by types of hogs produced and location of swine 
 farms, the output (number or thing that changes) is (changed to make better/changed to fit new conditions) to account for 
 
 27 
 
 such price differences. These output and input (numbers that change/things that change) are described below. 3 
 - Output (Y) represents a weighted output of live pigs 
 produced (in tons) during 19944 - 
 - Feed (X 1) represents the total amount of swine 
 concentrates and other grain-based feeds (in tons). 
 - Labor (X2 ) represents the total amount of family 
 labor and hired labor used in swine production (in 
 person days). 
 - Other (number or thing that changes) inputs (X3 ) represent the total of all 
 changeable expenses, except feed and hired labor (in 
 thousand dollars). 
 - Fixed input (X4 ) represents total costs of fixed 
 inputs including insurance, taxes and (lowering of value) 
 on pig housing, machinery and other equipment (in 
 thousand dollars). 
 The input prices needed for getting/taking the dual cost 
 edge of something/unexplored area in the parametric approach and for solving the 
 cost-(making small) DEA model in the nonparametric 
 approach are defined below. 
 W 1 represents the price of feed figured out/calculated as total 
 feed expenses divided by XI (in dollars/ton). w2 is the 
 price of labor figured out/calculated as the weighted average of the 
 value of family labor assumed to be US$_$ 6.94/h 
 (Hawaii Farming-based Labor, 1994) and actual wage 
 paid for hired labor (in dollars/person day). Because 
 other (number or thing that changes) and fixed inputs are expressed in values, 
 the computation of their prices is far from acceptable. 
 The price of other (number or thing that changes) inputs (W3 ) is figured out/calculated as 
 total expenses on all changeable inputs except feed 
 3 Summary statistics of these (numbers that change/things that change) can be found in Sharma et 
 a!. (1997a). 
 4 The weighted average of the pigs produced on the ith farm, Y;, is 
 defined by 
 
 where s represents the number of different types of pigs, P,.1 represents 
 the price received by the ith farm for pig type r, Q,.1 represents the live 
 weight of pig type r for the ith farm, 
 P =&#126;;&#126;I P,.; Â· Q,.1jQ;; Q; =&#126;;&#126;I Q,.1, and n represents the number 
 of farms in the sample. For our study s=5, where types of pigs 
 produced were market pigs, roaster pigs, feeder pigs, suckling pigs 
 and breeding stock. Because of the small share of picked breeding 
 stock in total returns and the lack of planned picking practice, 
 picked breeding stock was not included in the output. It should be 
 noted that defining the output (number or thing that changes) this way may contaminate 
 input-based technical and allocative inefficiencies with output or 
 money/money income-based allocative inefficiencies.

 and hired labor divided by X3. (in almost the same way), the price of 
 fixed input (W4 ) is figured out/calculated as total expenses on 
 fixed inputs divided by X4 - Almost the same as  Ferrier and 
 Lovell (1990), prices for other (number or thing that changes) and fixed 
 inputs equal US$_$ 1000 for all farms. 
 Different farm-clearly stated/particular factors are carefully studied to test 
 their influence on productive (wasting very little while working or producing something). Size (Z1) 
 represents the size of a farm, defined in terms of the 
 number of pigs. The farmer's education level is 
 represented by two dummy (numbers that change/things that change), Zz and Z:3 where 
 Zz= 1 for college education, 0 otherwise, and Z3= 1 for 
 high school, 0 otherwise. Experience (Z4 ) represents 
 the farmer's experience measured in the number of 
 years he/she has been working at swine production. 
 The sample swine farmers are also (made different) in 
 terms of the types of pigs produced (Z5 ) and feeding 
 government (Z6 ) where Z5 = 1 for market hogs, 0 for feeder 
 pigs, and Z6 = 1 for garbage or mixed feeding, 0 for 
 grain feeding. Finally, location (0) is a dummy (number or thing that changes) to (make different) farms located on Oahu from those 
 on Neighbor Islands, with 0 being 1 for Oahu, 0 for 
 Neighbor Islands. 
 
 technology and the similar edge of something/unexplored area for CRS 
 can be gotten by forcing the restriction that the 
 sum of the output elasticities of inputs equals one (i.e., 
 L:&#126;=l f3k = t). 
 The dual cost edge of something/unexplored area of the production function in 
 Eq. (14) can be received/made from as 6 
 ln C; = ao 
 
 (15) 
 
 where i refers to the ith sample farm; C is the minimum cost of production; Ws are input prices, defined 
 in the previous section; Y is the output (changed to make better/changed to fit new conditions) for 
 (random/including random data points) noise vas in Eq. (3); and as are limits/guidelines. 
 Under the nonparametric approach, CRS, VRS and 
 NIRS input-reducing and CRS and VRS cost-(making small) DEA models as presented in Section 2.2 are 
 guessed for the same number of farms and the same 
 output and input (numbers that change/things that change) as for the (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area. 
 To examine the role of (connected/related) farm-clearly stated/particular factors in productive (wasting very little while working or producing something), the following equation is 
 guessed:

 3.3. Scientific models 
 Under the parametric approach, the Cobb-Douglas 
 (random/including random data points) production edge of something/unexplored area is specified as follows 5 
 ln Y; = f3o 
 
 + (31 ln Xil + f3z ln X;z + (33 ln X;3 
 (14) 
 
 where i refers to the ith farm in the sample; Y is output 
 and Xs are input (numbers that change/things that change), defined in the previous 
 section; (3s are limits/guidelines to be guessed; and c; is the 
 (made up of different things) error term, defined in Section 2.1. Note that 
 the production edge of something/unexplored area in Eq. (14) represents VRS 
 5The Cobb-Douglas form is chosen because the way(s) of doing things 
 used here needs/demands that the production function be self-dual. 
 (even though there is the existence of) its limits, the Cobb-Douglas form is found to be an 
 (good) enough representation of the data, given the (detailed description of exactly what is required) of the 
 more flexible translog form (see Sharma et al., l997a). The 
 production edge of something/unexplored area was also guessed for a sample of 5 I farms 
 after eliminating the two farms connected with the highest and 
 lowest technical and money-based (wasting very little while working or producing something) scores to test the 
 sensitivity of the two approaches to the possible (things that aren't part of the main group). It would 
 also be interesting to carefully study different sub-sets of data received/got by 
 separating the sample farms based on their key (features/ qualities/ traits) 
 (such as farm size, location, feed type, etc.) to further examine the 
 strength of the two approaches. However, because of a small 
 sample, such analyses could not be carried out.

 will have a positive (negative) effect on (wasting very little while working or producing something)

 presented in Table 1 are the OLS results of the average 
 production function for comparison. The ML results 
 for the CRS model and for models without the 
 two possible (things that aren't part of the main group) are not presented due to space 
 limits. 
 As expected, the signs of the slope coefficients of 
 the (random/including random data points) production edge of something/unexplored area are positive. Except 
 for the coefficient for fixed input, these guessed 
 coefficients are highly significant. The guess 
 of the variance limit/guideline, "(, is also significantly 
 different from zero, which hints that the inefficiency 
 effects are significant in deciding/figuring out the level 
 and (quality of changing over time or at different places) of output of swine producers in 
 Hawaii.

 guessed mean technical, allocative and money-based 
 (wasting very little while working or producing something) indices are 75.9%, 75.8% and 57.1 %, 
 (match up each pair of items in order), under VRS and 74.5%, 73.9% and 
 54.7% under CRS, pointing to/showing that there are (large/relatively large) inefficiencies in swine production in Hawaii. The 
 majority of producers fall within the ranges of 7080%, 80-90% and 60-70% of technical, allocative and 
 money-based (wasting very little while working or producing something) indices, (match up each pair of items in order). 
 4.2. DEA edge of something/unexplored area results 
 
 DEA models were guessed using the program, 
 DEAP 2.0 (Coelli, 1996). The technical, allocative and 
 money-based (wasting very little while working or producing something) measures guessed from the 
 DEA approach and their frequency distributions are 
 summarized in Table 2. The guessed mean TE measure for the sample swine producers is 75.9% for the 
 VRS DEA model and 64.3% for the CRS DEA model. 
 In terms of TE, 17 of the 53 farms (examined closely) are 
 fully (producing a lot with very little waste) under the VRS model. Under the CRS 
 model, only 10 farms are fully (producing a lot with very little waste). The mean 
 allocative and money-based (wasting very little while working or producing something) measures guessed from the DEA edge of something/unexplored area are 80.3% and 60.3%, 
 (match up each pair of items in order), for VRS, and 71.4% and 45.7% for CRS. 
 This way DEA analyses, especially CRS results, also 
 show/tell about big inefficiencies in swine production 
 in Hawaii. 
 The scale (wasting very little while working or producing something) index for the swine producers 
 differs/changes from 43.2% to 100%, with a sample mean of 
 84.1 %. In terms of scale (wasting very little while working or producing something), 13 farms 
 show CRS. Among the scale inefficient farms, 29

 show increasing returns to scale and 11 show decreasing returns to scale. As expected, most of the large 
 farms (&amp;gt; 7 5 plants seed causes) are seen as decreasing 
 returns to scale, while most small and 
 medium sized farms (&#126;75 pigs) show increasing 
 returns to scale. 
 The TE measures for the sample swine producers 
 guessed here from the input-based DEA edges of something/unexplored areas are 
 quite similar with those guessed from the 
 output-based edges of something/unexplored areas (Sharma et al., 1997a). 
 Although, the mean scale (wasting very little while working or producing something) from the 
 output-based DEA edge of something/unexplored area (89.2%) is higher than 
 that from the input-based edge of something/unexplored area (84.1% ), this difference is not significant at the 0.05 level. However, 
 the two edges of something/unexplored areas differ much with respect to 
 returns to scale properties. About 21% of sample 
 farmers show decreasing returns to scale in inputbased DEA analysis compared to 45% in output-based 
 analysis. 
 4.3. Comparing parametric and DEA results 
 The two approaches used here to measure the 
 technical, allocative and money-based (wasting very little while working or producing something) measures for the sample swine farms are based on different 
 production edges of something/unexplored areas. The parametric approach is 
 based on a (random/including random data points) production edge of something/unexplored area and nonparametric data envelopment analysis is based on a nonstochastic or pre-decided edge of something/unexplored area. It is expected that 
 
 (wasting very little while working or producing something) scores guessed from the DEA edge of something/unexplored area 
 would be less than those received/got from the (random/including random data points) 
 edge of something/unexplored area because the DEA attributes any moving away 
 from the edge of something/unexplored area to inefficiency. 
 The agreements or disagreements in the (wasting very little while working or producing something) 
 scores guessed from the two approaches are summarized in Table 3. Also presented in Table 3 are 
 almost the same  results received/got by eliminating two possible 
 (things that aren't part of the main group) connected with the highest and lowest technical and money-based (wasting very little while working or producing something) indices. Based on 
 paired t-tests, on average, the technical and money-based 
 (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) under CRS are much higher in the 
 parametric approach than in DEA, (without any concern about/having nothing to do with) the 
 presence or (not being there; not being present) of the possible (things that aren't part of the main group), while for 
 VRS models these results are almost the same  for the two 
 approaches except for a higher TE score in the parametric approach without the two (things that aren't part of the main group). On average, 
 allocative (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) are higher in DEA than in the 
 parametric approach, except for CRS models with all 
 the (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) in the sample where the allocative 
 (wasting very little while working or producing something) measure is higher under the parametric 
 way of doing things. So, for the data involved in this study 
 the idea (you think is true) on returns to scale is found to be 
 critical in explaining the differences in (wasting very little while working or producing something) 
 measures came/coming from the two procedures. Although, 
 because of its pre-decided property, DEA is believed 
 to be more sensitive to (things that aren't part of the main group) and other noise in the 
 data, comparing the results with and without the 
 possible (things that aren't part of the main group) we find DEA results to be more

 strong than those received/got from the parametric 
 approach. 9 
 To further examine the agreements between the 
 parametric and nonparametric approaches, Spearman 
 relationship coefficients between the (wasting very little while working or producing something) rankings of the sample swine producers from the two 
 approaches were also figured out/calculated. These results are 
 also presented in Table 3. All the TE, AE and EE 
 rank relationships are positive and highly significant. 
 The strongest relationship between the (wasting very little while working or producing something) rankings from the two approaches is received/got for TE under 
 CRS, while allocative (wasting very little while working or producing something) under VRS shows the 
 weakest relationship. The removal of the two (things that aren't part of the main group) 
 has little hit/effect on (wasting very little while working or producing something) rankings of the producers. 
 While the sample farms show both decreasing 
 returns and increasing returns to scale in the DEA 
 edge of something/unexplored area, the null guess of CRS is not rejected in 
 9 The high degree of strength of DEA can also be shown by 
 comparing the numbers of technically, allocatively and (money-based)/cheaply fully (producing a lot with very little waste) farms and the returns to scale properties with or 
 without the two (things that aren't part of the main group). For example, the numbers of technically 
 fully (producing a lot with very little waste) farms under CRS and VRS in the original sample are 
 10 and 17, (match up each pair of items in order), compared to 9 and 17 without the two 
 (things that aren't part of the main group). (in almost the same way), the numbers of allocatively and (money-based)/cheaply 
 fully (producing a lot with very little waste) farms for CRS and VRS models were 1 and 3, 
 (match up each pair of items in order), for the original sample compared to 1 and 4 without 
 (things that aren't part of the main group). The guesses of scale (wasting very little while working or producing something) (84.1% vs. 85.5%) and 
 the distributions of farms by returns to scale property were also 
 very almost the same  for the two analyses. 
 
 the (random/including random data points) production edge of something/unexplored area. 10 What's more, the 
 VRS and CRS (wasting very little while working or producing something) rankings of sample swine 
 farms are more highly related in the parametric 
 approach (p&amp;gt;0.98) than in nonparametric DEA 
 (0.70&amp;lt;p&amp;lt;0.75). 
 Compared to previous studies applying the two 
 approaches to the same data set, the guessed (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) presented here are more agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with the 
 expectation that (wasting very little while working or producing something) scores came/coming from the 
 parametric approach would be higher than those from 
 nonparametric DEA. However, in terms of rank relationship of the different (wasting very little while working or producing something) measures, the two 
 approaches are found to be highly similar. These 
 results are quite agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with the study of UK 
 building (communities of people) by Drake and Weyman-Jones 
 (1996). Based on the analysis of US banks, Ferrier 
 and Lovell (1990) found higher technical but lower 
 money-based (wasting very little while working or producing something) for the parametric method compared to DEA and unimportant rank relationships 
 between the guessed (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) from the two 
 approaches. Carefully studying a sample of Guatemalan farmers, Kalaitzandonakes and Dunn (1995) reported a 
 much higher level of mean TE under CRS DEA 
 than under the (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area. These results contrast sharply with this study. These disagreements in

 scientific studies in comparing the two approaches 
 can be mainly attributed to differences in the (features/ qualities/ traits) of the data carefully studied, choice of input and 
 output (numbers that change/things that change), measurement and (detailed description of exactly what is required) 
 errors, and guess procedures. 
 4.4. Factors affecting (wasting very little while working or producing something) levels 
 The limits/guidelines in Eq. (16) were guessed using 
 the OLS procedure for the parametric approach, while 
 those for the DEA approach were guessed using the 
 Shazam's tobit guess procedure, because the 
 values of the (thing that changes (like a test score) because of something else that you control (like study time)) are zero for some 
 (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) in the DEA. These results are presented 
 in Table 4. Farm size has a negative and significant 
 effect on inefficiency levels, which hints that, on 
 average, large farms operate at higher (wasting very little while working or producing something) levels 
 than small farms. Better performance among larger 
 farms is because of much lower labor use 
 per unit of output produced and a lower feed price on 
 large farms than on smaller ones (Sharma et al., 
 1997b). Farms that produce market hogs are found 
 to be (producing more with less waste) than feeder pig producers and in 
 most cases the connected coefficients are highly significant. Reasons for this difference include much lower labor use and lower feed price among 
 market hog producers than feeder pig producers. The 
 
 effect of the producer's experience on the (wasting very little while working or producing something) of 
 swine production is mostly positive but the effect is 
 either medium-level or unimportant. Except for allocative 
 (wasting very little while working or producing something), the coefficients for education dummies 
 show unexpected signs, although they are mostly 
 unimportant. In most cases, garbage feeders seem less 
 (producing a lot with very little waste) than grain feeders, and farmers on Oahu seem 
 (producing more with less waste) than those on Neighbor Islands. However, the slope coefficients for these (numbers that change/things that change) are 
 mostly unimportant. Overall, both in terms of signs 
 and importance levels of the coefficients, these results 
 are quite almost the same  for the two approaches. 
 4.5. Effects/results/suggestions 
 Both approaches show/tell about (large/relatively large) inefficiencies 
 in swine production in Hawaii. Minimum or (money-based)/cheaply (producing a lot with very little waste) costs and possible cost reductions at 
 full (wasting very little while working or producing something) levels by farm size are presented in 
 Tables 5 and 6 for the parametric and DEA 
 approaches, (match up each pair of items in order). 
 According to the parametric results, the sample 
 producers would be able to reduce their actual costs 
 by 38% by operating at full technical and allocative 
 (wasting very little while working or producing something) levels. As shown in Table 5, large farms 
 would reduce their costs by 34% and small and 
 medium sized farms by 47% by operating at full

 (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste). Operating at the full TE level accounts for 
 about 52%, 64% and 57% of the total cost reduction 
 for small, medium and large farms, (match up each pair of items in order). 
 These results are quite almost the same  under VRS and CRS 
 (detailed descriptions of exactly what is required). 
 Based on DEA (wasting very little while working or producing something) guesses, by reaching 
 full (wasting very little while working or producing something) levels, the sample producers would 
 reduce their costs by 46% under CRS and 39% under 
 VRS. As shown in Table 6, the CRS cost reductions 
 for small, medium and large farms are guessed to be 
 about 61%, 64% and 40%, (match up each pair of items in order). These numbers are (a) little smaller for the VRS DEA model. 
 Operating at full total/totally/with nothing else mixed in technical and scale (wasting very little while working or producing something) 
 ('overall' TE) levels accounts for about 52%, 76% and 
 51% of the total cost reductions for small, medium, 
 and large farms, (match up each pair of items in order). 
 Based on these results, the total potential cost 
 reduction for all commercial swine producers in 
 Hawaii is guessed to be about US$_$ 5 million/year 
 under the parametric way of doing things and US$_$ 6-7 million/ 
 year under DEA. 
 
 5. Ends/end results 
 This paper analyses technical, allocative and money-based (wasting very little while working or producing something) for a sample of swine producers in 
 Hawaii using the parametric and nonparametric edge of something/unexplored area approaches, and compares the (wasting very little while working or producing something) guesses 
 received/got from the two approaches. The parametric 
 method is based on Kopp and Diewert's cost rotting approach for guessing Farrell's (wasting very little while working or producing something) 
 measures where a Cobb-Douglas (random/including random data points) production edge of something/unexplored area is guessed and the similar dual 
 cost edge of something/unexplored area is received/made from math-relatedally. The Kopp and 
 Diewert's approach is useful when the input prices are 
 not enough to guess a cost edge of something/unexplored area econometrically. 
 The nonparametric approach involves the guess 
 of different input-based data envelopment analysis 
 (DEA) models. The effect of different factors on the 
 (wasting very little while working or producing something) levels is examined by guessing a moving backward model where different production inefficiencies (in 
 US$_$ 1000/ton of output produced) are expressed as a 
 function of different farm-clearly stated/particular factors.

 The mean technical, allocative and money-based (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) under (number or thing that changes) returns to scale (VRS) are 
 75.9%, 75.8% and 57.1 %, (match up each pair of items in order), for the parametric approach and 75.9%, 80.3% and 60.3% for 
 DEA. The similar measures for CRS are 
 74.5%, 73.9% and 54.7%, (match up each pair of items in order), for the parametric approach and 64.3%, 71.4% and 45.7% for 
 DEA. On average, the guessed technical and money-based (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) are much higher in the parametric way of doing things than in DEA for CRS models but 
 quite almost the same  for VRS models, while allocative (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) are usually higher in DEA than in the 
 parametric method. However, the (wasting very little while working or producing something) rankings 
 of the sample producers based on the two approaches 
 are positively and significantly related. Opposite to 
 the expectation that DEA is more sensitive to (things that aren't part of the main group) 
 and other noise in the data, we find DEA results to be 
 more strong than those received/got from the parametric 
 approach. This interesting finding as well as the disagreements in existing studies comparing the two 
 edge of something/unexplored area approaches (shows or proves) the need for more 
 scientific work to further examine the performance of 
 the two approaches using the same data sets. 
 The results show/tell about big production inefficiencies for sample swine producers in Hawaii and hence 
 (large/relatively large) (possibility of/possible happening of)  improving a money-making state by 
 reducing costs through improved (wasting very little while working or producing something). On average, by operating at full money-based (wasting very little while working or producing something) levels the 
 sample producers would be able to reduce their cost by 
 38-46% depending upon the method employed and 
 returns to scale idea (you think is true). These reductions in costs 
 from improvements in (wasting very little while working or producing something) are very important to 
 improve a money-making state of the sample producers, especially of medium and small producers who earn a 
 negative net return from swine production. If all farms 
 were fully (producing a lot with very little waste) in production, Hawaii's pig-related 
 industry would be able to save about US$_$ 5-7 million 
 in production costs every year. 
 Analysis of different firm-clearly stated/particular factors shows that 
 farm size has a positive and significant effect on 
 (wasting very little while working or producing something) levels, suggesting that cost inefficiency can 
 be reduced by fully using (processes of people making, selling, and buying things) of size. The analysis 
 also shows/tells about that farms which raise hogs for market are 
 (producing more with less waste) than feeder pig producers. Results also 
 show a positive relationship between a producer's 
 experience and production (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste). However, the 
 results do not support the guess that education level 
 improves/increases production performance.
