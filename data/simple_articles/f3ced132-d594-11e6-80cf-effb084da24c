 Abstract 
 The recent (away from cities) changes in China have had great effects on farming-based production and working well as well as 
 (away from cities) household consumption. While much has been written on production and working well effects of these changes, 
 very few Chinese studies have tried to carefully study the changes in (away from cities) consumption patterns. This paper uses a 
 energetic AIDS model to guess different food demand limits/guidelines for Chinese (away from cities) families using (away from cities) 
 household survey data (not very long ago) released by the China State (related to studying numbers) Bureau. The results show that all important 
 food valuable things including rice, wheat, rough grains, vegetables, meat, tobacco and alcohol have positive 
 expense elasticities. Rice, wheat and rough grains are needs, while meat, vegetables, alcohol and tobacco 
 are expensive things/special privileges. The expense elasticities for rice, rough grains and tobacco are (lowering in number/getting worse), but those for wheat, meat, 
 vegetables and alcohol are increasing. As per person income rises and population increases, the demand for these 
 items will continue to increase. Therefore, China must continue to increase its food production by a greater rate in 
 the future in order to avoid food shortages. 
 
 After 30 years of socialist revolution, China 
 started in 1979 its well known (away from cities) changes, 
 which changed farming-based production from 
 central planning to a market-driven system. These 
 changes have had significant effects on farming-based production and working well as well as (away from cities) 
 household food demand in China. While much 
 has been written on the production and working well effects of the (away from cities) changes, very few Chinese studies have tried to carefully study in detail

 (away from cities) household consumption behavior during this

 reduced (in a big way) and was increased/added

 with (away from cities) residents accounting for more than 
 70% of the national total population. So, 
 changes in the consumption pattern of China's 
 (away from cities) population can have big effects on 
 both domestic and international trade, especially on food and farming-based trade. Knowledge 
 of (away from cities) household food demand behavior, and 
 the effects of current and future changes on food 
 consumption patterns provides important information for policy makers in redesigning and testing policy options. 
 A few studies on Chinese household consumption (including (away from cities) families) have been 
 conducted (before that/before now). Linear expense systems 
 were applied for (away from cities) families in Hubei 
 area of control/area of land and city-based  families in Beijing for 
 1981 and 1982 (Van der Gaag, 1984; Li, Yang 
 and He, 1985). Lewis and Andrews (1989) also 
 employed a linear expense system to guess 
 city-based  and (away from cities) household demand in China. The 
 small number of (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) available for these 
 former studies limited the (ability to be used for something) of the 
 results. This study is different from the previous ones 
 in a few aspects. Firstly, we use (related to a local area) group time-series data from (away from cities) household 
 surveys for a (compared to other things) long-term period from 
 1982 to 1990. These data were collected by the 
 General Organization for (away from cities) Household Surveys of the State (related to studying numbers) Bureau. This data set 
 provides more (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) and more difference/different version 
 for each (number or thing that changes), plus it enables us to watch/notice 
 changes in consumption patterns over time. Secondly, a more flexible demand system, namely the 
 almost ideal demand system (AIDS), is employed 
 to guess food demand in (away from cities) China. Thirdly, 
 the energetic nature of food consumption for the 
 (away from cities) families is carefully thought about/believed in the model. During the period of analysis (1982-1990), per person 
 incomes as well as consumption patterns have 
 changed. As demand limits/guidelines may 
 have changed, the model used to carefully study these 
 limits/guidelines must be energetic. 
 The paper is organized as follows. The first 
 section of the paper reviews general food consumption patterns and their changes over time in 
 (away from cities) China. Section 2 introduces a general 
 (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) (model) which is good for carefully studying 
 food consumption patterns in China. The third 
 
 section discusses the data sources and the 
 way(s) of doing things in building (numbers that change/things that change) for food 
 demand guess. We scientifically guess the 
 demand system for (away from cities) families and discuss 
 guessed expense and price elasticities in the 
 fourth section. Finally, we discuss some policy 
 effects/results/suggestions of this study. 
 
 1. Food consumption patterns in (away from cities) China 
 
 In this part of the paper, we discuss the general (popular thing/general way things are going) of food consumption patterns in (away from cities) 
 China. We give special attention to the effects of 
 the (away from cities) changes on the changes in food consumption. However, the (away from cities) changes do not 
 have a significant direct effect on (away from cities) consumption. They affect consumption patterns indirectly 
 through income and relative price changes. Per 
 capita income has increased (in a big way) since 
 1978 due to the changes. Average per person 
 income increased only by 2.4% per year in real 
 terms from 1957 to 1978, but then it sped up 
 to 7.1% per year from 1978 to 1990. The 
 relative prices have also changed significantly 
 since the changes were introduced. The retail 
 price index increased by 0.5% per year from 
 1957 to 1978, while it increased by 6.3% per 
 year from 1978 to 1990. Among all consumption products (that are bought and sold), food prices increased the most quickly 
 since the changes, at a rate of 8.1% per year, 
 while clothing prices increased the least, at 3.3% 
 per year. Fuel and other valuable thing price increases fall between the above two groups, at 
 5.5% and 3.9% per year, (match up each pair of items in order). 
 Table 1 shows the long-term basic (popular things/general ways things are going) in 
 (away from cities) household expenses in China. The proportion of food expenses to total expenses (lowered in number/got worse/gotten worse) steadily from 65.9% in 1957 to 
 54.9% in 1990. Of the 11% decline, only 4% had 
 happened from 1957 to 1980; only after 1980, did 
 the food expense decline sharply. In fact, it 
 dropped almost 7% in the last ten years. This decline would have been even larger if the food 
 prices had not increased significantly during the 
 1980s. 
 Table 2 shows the (popular thing/general way things are going) of food consumption 
 on a per person basis in (away from cities) China. Fine grain

 Note: Total income and expenses are measured in (in name only/very small amount) terms. The personal price index from 1957 to 1990 is 232.6%. 
 Other expenses include expenses on daily used articles (soaps, detergent, bicycles, washing machines, sewing machines, watches, 
 clocks, electrical fans, refrigerators, motorcycles, sofas, dressing chests, and desks) and cultural related products (that are bought and sold) (radios, TV sets, 
 recorders, cameras, newspapers, etc.). 
 
 consumption increased (only a little bit) from 1957 to 
 1977. 2 It increased significantly from 1978 to 
 1982; then the growth slowed after 1983. Rough 
 grain consumption (lowered in number/got worse/gotten worse) very little from 1957 
 to 1978. It dropped (in a big way) from 1978 to 
 1985 and became stable after 1986. 3 As a part of total fine grain consumption, rice changed

 very little from 1982 to 1990, while wheat increased by more than 20 kg per person during the 
 same period. Per person meat consumption almost doubled over the period from 1978 to 1990. 
 Vegetable consumption changed very little, although it went up and down across years. Alcohol and 
 tobacco consumption has increased sharply. Alcohol increased four times from 1978 to 1990, while 
 tobacco increased by 80% from 1981 to 1990. 
 In terms of food expense shares, rice has 
 declined while wheat increased (a) little (Table 3).

 farmers have reduced consumption of corn, 
 (grass grown for food) and sweet potatoes. Alcohol and tobacco expenses have increased only (a) little 
 although amount ate/destroyed increased significantly, since their prices have changed very little 
 compared to other valuable things. Other food expenses including tea, sugar, fruit and fish 
 have increased (in a big way).

 As talked about/said, as a result of big increase in per person income in (away from cities) China, the 
 consumption patterns have changed 
 for some food products in the last ten years. The 
 possible model to be employed for this study 
 has to take into account these changes. So, the 
 model has to be able to take by force/take control of the energetic

 nature of the consumption limits/guidelines for Chinese (away from cities) families. In other words, the model 
 should have the ability to reflect the changes in 
 consumption patterns of the (away from cities) population. 
 However, due to data limits and the group nature of the data set, we cannot use formal 
 or ordinary energetic demand models. Therefore, the model should not only think about/believe the 
 energetic nature of the consumption patterns, but 
 also take into account the data limits. 
 The advantages of the AIDS model have been 
 discussed by Deaton and Muellbauer (1980) and 
 Alston et al. (1990) among others. The energetic 
 AIDS cost function has the following form: 
 ln C[t, u(t), p(t)]_) = ln a[t, p(t)]_) 
 +u(t)b[t,p(t)]_) 
 (1) 
 where 
 ln a [_( t, p( t)]_) 
 
 Now, we plan the habit behavior of people over time. (thinking about/when one thinks about) the data availability (only 9 years data), we think about/believe the following 
 simplified habit (creation and construction/ group of objects): 
 
 a;(t) =a?+ (;t 
 'Yij( t) = 'Y;&#126; + ()ijt

 and 
 
 +[13?+p;t](Inx(t)-lna[t,p(t)]_))

 Following Green and Alston (1990), the energetic un-paid-for price elasticities can be 
 calculated as: 
 
 W; 
 
 b[t, p(t)]_) = 13oUP;(t) 13 ;&amp;lt;c&amp;gt;

 3. Data sources and explanations 
 
 This study makes use of the greater availability 
 of good data since the earlier studies were 
 published. The income, expense and consumption data used in this study are from sample 
 surveys managed and did/done by the General Organization 
 for (away from cities) Household Survey of the State (related to studying numbers) Bureau. The survey started in 1955, was suspended during the Cultural Revolution, and was 
 resumed in 1978. China began to publish (related to a local area) group data from the surveys in 1982. 
 Families are selected using a three-stage layered and (deep-down/basic) sampling method. Counties are 
 selected from each area of control/area of land, sub-village groups 
 (production teams) are selected from counties, 
 and families are selected from sub-village 
 groups. 4 All families are ranked using a major 
 indicator, such as income in the previous year. 
 Using total population figures and the desired sample size, the sample period of time (or space) can be 
 serious and stubborn, and units falling in the midpoints of 
 each period of time (or space) are selected for including in something in the 
 survey (Taylor and Hardee, 1986; Tuan and 
 Crook, 1983; Lewis and Andrews, 1989). Chinese 
 (people in charge) recognize that this procedure is not 
 strictly obeying the ways of thinking/basic truths/rules of random sampling but claim that the hit/effect is not 
 significant (Lewis and Andrews, 1989). The number of (away from cities) families surveyed has increased 
 each year since 1978, and in 1990 the sample 
 included 66 960 families. 
 Combined time-series and thin slice data for 
 (away from cities) China were used in this study. The analysis 
 covers the period from 1982 to 1990. In a perfect world, the 
 analysis should cover some years before 1978, but 
 this may not be a serious problem to carefully study 
 changes in consumption behavior since most (away from cities) 
 price and marketing changes were done/tried 
 after 1982. Even the production responsibility 
 
 4 The (related to managing and running a company or organization) system in (away from cities) China before the reform was state, area of control/area of land, county, home, production 
 military unit/group of people, and production team. After the reform, the subcounty level has been changed to township (home), village 
 (production military unit/group of people), and sub-village group (production team). 
 
 system was not fully put into use by 1983, 5 and 
 the effects of the system were not fully released 
 until 1984. 6 Twenty-eight areas (self-ruling 
 areas or cities) were included in the 
 analysis. Tibet and Hainan are left out/kept out due to 
 data unavailability. Consumption data were available from the survey for individual food items 
 including rice, wheat, rough grain, meat (including pork, beef and mutton), vegetables, fruit, tea, 
 sugar, alcohol, fish, cooking oil and tobacco. Price 
 data for these food items were taken from different 
 issues of China's Valuable thing Price (related to studying numbers) 
 Yearbooks (China State (related to studying numbers) Bureau, 19861991) and China's Price Yearbooks (China Ministry of (the buying and selling of goods), 1987-1991). These data were 
 collected from (away from cities) markets and trade posts in 
 different areas. The expense data on these 
 items were came/coming from consumption and price 
 data. 
 
 4. Guess and scientific results 
 
 First, we guess equation (4), using repeating/repetitive 
 SUR ways of doing things with matching and evenness 
 restrictions applied. Then, we test whether the 
 price and expense elasticities have changed 
 over time. The test of whether or not price and 
 expense elasticities have changed is equal to the test of whether the limits/guidelines of time 
 (popular thing/general way things are going) in habit (creation and construction/ group of objects) (5) are equal to zero 
 (i.e., [_(; = 0, eij = 0, and P; = 0). The WALD 
 statistics are employed in the test. The test results are presented in Table 4. We reject the 
 guess that the constant term and price limits/guidelines have changed over time except for tobacco. However, we cannot reject the guess 
 that expense elasticities have changed. There- 
 
 5 The percentages of production teams that adopted the 
 household responsibility system are 14% in 1980, 45% in 
 1981, 80% in 1982, 98% in 1983, (match up each pair of items in order) (Lin, 1992). 
 6 According to Fan's guess, the production (wasting very little while working or producing something) 
 effects of the changes were released through a period of time 
 (0.753 in 1980, 0.768 in 1981, 0.788 in 1982, 0.791 in 1983, 
 0.83.1 in 1984, and 0.843 in 1985). Only after 1984 and 1985 
 did the (wasting very little while working or producing something) start to improve greatly.

 Note: The critical value of x 2 distribution for p = 0.05 is 
 16.92 (d.f. = 9). The symbol * points to/shows that we can not reject, 
 at the 5% level, the guess that demand limits/guidelines have 
 changed over the time. 
 
 fore, we re-guess the equations in which the 
 price limits/guidelines do not change while expense limits/guidelines change. 
 The guessed food demand limits/guidelines are 
 presented in Table 5. Most of the guesses for 
 price coefficients are significant at the 5% level 
 except for some cross price limits/guidelines. Expense limits/guidelines are significant while three of 
 four of the time (popular thing/general way things are going) limits/guidelines of expenses 
 are significant at the 5% level. The guessed 
 price and expense elasticities are presented 
 in Table 6. The price elasticities for grains including rice, wheat and rough grains are almost the same, 
 ranging from -0.455 for wheat to -0.547 for 
 rice. The price ability to stretch for meat is higher than 
 for both grains and vegetables. Alcohol has the 
 
 highest price ability to stretch. Tobacco has a positive 
 price ability to stretch which points to/shows that Chinese farmers increase tobacco consumption even when tobacco prices rise. In fact, per-person use 
 of tobacco in (away from cities) China has risen very much 
 even though tobacco prices have increased 
 (a) little. Most of the cross price elasticities have 
 positive signs which mean that they are substitutes. However, both tobacco and alcohol have 
 three negative signs of cross price elasticities. 
 Expense elasticities of demand for grains are 
 inelastic which point to/show that grains are necessary 
 products (that are bought and sold). The expense elasticities for rice and 
 rough grains are (lowering in number/getting worse), while the wheat expense ability to stretch is increasing. The demand for 
 meat and vegetables is elastic in total food expense, and this demand is increasing over time. 
 So, meat and vegetables are carefully thought about/believed (expensive and desirable) 
 products (that are bought and sold). The demands for tobacco and alcohol are 
 elastic with respect to food expenses, which 
 hints that Chinese farmers will spend more on 
 these items as their incomes rise. 
 These guesses can be compared with those 
 of other studies. Since very few studies (except 
 Lewis and Andrew, 1989) have reported expense and price elasticities for Chinese (away from cities) 
 families, we only compare our guesses with 
 Lewis and Andrews. All of our guesses of both 
 expense and price elasticities are higher than 
 theirs (the expense elasticities of grain, pork, 
 (related to chickens, hens, turkeys, etc.) and fish are 0.22, 1.02, 1.95 and 3.56, 
 (match up each pair of items in order), and the price elasticities of those 
 valuable things are -0.14, -0.23, -0.09 and

 - 0.69, (match up each pair of items in order)). This may be partly explained by the fact that this study covers a much 
 longer period, and that prices and marketing 
 (machines/methods/ways) have improved (not very long ago). Farmers may 
 have become more (able to reply or react/quick to respond) to the price 
 changes. The Lewis and Andrews' study only 
 covered the period from 1982 to 1985. 
 
 5. Ends/end results 
 
 This study shows that (away from cities) changes in China 
 have really affected the food consumption patterns of Chinese (away from cities) families. 
 Per-person use of grains increased in the 
 early-reform period but has (made steady/made firm and strong) (not very long ago). 
 Rice consumption has been spoiled, while wheat 
 consumption continues to increase. Rough grain 
 consumption has (lowered in number/got worse/gotten worse) almost by half since 
 1982. Meat consumption increased sharply during 
 the beginning of the reform, but the growth has 
 slowed down (not very long ago). Vegetable consumption is 
 spoiled, while alcohol and tobacco consumption 
 has increased (in a big way). In terms of the cost 
 structure in food consumption, Chinese farmers 
 have reduced their expenses on grain consumption while they have increased their expense shares on meat, vegetables, alcohol, tobacco and other food items. 
 The (away from cities) changes have affected consumption 
 behavior through both price and income changes. 
 
 We tested whether the price and expense elasticities have changed over this reforming period. Our results showed that price 
 elasticities have not changed while expense 
 elasticities have changed. 
 These results may have important policy effects/results/suggestions for China as well as farming-based and trade 
 policies of other countries. The expense elasticities for all food items are positive, suggesting 
 that Chinese (away from cities) families will continue to 
 increase their consumption on all these food items 
 as their incomes rise. The expense elasticities 
 for rice and rough grains are (lowering in number/getting worse), and that 
 for rough grains dropped to almost zero. The 
 expense elasticities for meat, vegetables, tobacco and alcohol are all elastic and increasing 
 over time. The demand for these (expensive and desirable) food 
 items will speed up as incomes rise. Therefore, 
 China will likely face increasing pressure to import food in the future as its (process of people making, selling, and buying things) expands 
 and per person incomes rise. 
 The decline of rice expense ability to stretch and 
 increase of wheat expense ability to stretch suggest that 
 China will continue to export rice and import 
 wheat. The high expense ability to stretch for meat 
 and low demand for direct rough grain consumption means that China may reduce its direct rough 
 grain consumption and increase the use of rough 
 grains as animal feed. Due to the limited land 
 useful things/valuable supplies, China may import big amounts 
 of feed grains from the international market and 
 
 S. Fan et a/. /Agricultural Money flow 11 (1994) 61-69 
 
 use its (compared to other things) cheap labor force to develop its 
 animals industry.
