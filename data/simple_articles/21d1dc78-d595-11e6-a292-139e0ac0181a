 ABSTRACT 
 Huang, J. and David, C.C., 1992. Demand for cereal grains in Asia: the effect of (city growth). Agric. Econ., 8: 107-124. 
 This paper carefully studies the effects of (city growth) on demand for cereal grains - rice, 
 wheat, and rough grains - in nine Asian countries. A complete demand system (Almost 
 Ideal Demand System in linear form) is guessed in two stages based on group time 
 series data from 1960 to 1988. 
 In the high-income countries, (in other words) Japan and South Korea, (city growth) was watched/followed to 
 reduce (a lot) demand for cereal grains. In the lower-income countries, demand for 
 cereal grains either increased or remained the same with (city growth). 
 Among cereal grains, (city growth) has had negative effects on demand for rice and 
 rough grains, but regularly positive effects on demand for wheat. Only Japan and 
 Thailand among the countries studied have negative income elasticities of demand for total 
 cereal grains and for rice especially. Hence, rice remains a need and a (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) good 
 in most Asian countries. 
 Previous guesses of income elasticities of rice based on time-series group data tend 
 to be lower than those based on thin slice household level data. When (city growth) is 
 clearly specified in the demand model, the guesses of income elasticities from time-series 
 data turn out to be agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with those from thin slice data. 
 
 INTRODUCTION 
 
 Cereal grains account for two-thirds of the calorie intake in the average 
 Asian diet. Except in Pakistan, where wheat is the staple food, rice 
 continues to be the most in control/most common staple grain, adding/giving 40-75% of total 
 calorie intake in most Asian countries. Significant amounts of wheat are

 ate/destroyed in northern parts of China and India, while rough grains such as 
 corn, grain and (grass grown for food) are important staples only in (compared to other things) small 
 parts of the Philippines, South Korea and Indonesia. Not only is rice the 
 major staple food, more than half of the (away from cities) labor force is involved in rice 
 production and so it is also the major source of job in (away from cities) Asia 
 (Barker and Herdt, 1985). Because of the political importance of food 
 independence and cheap food in Asia, the nature of future demand for 
 cereal grains, especially of rice, is of major concern for policy creation. 
 Although many studies of demand for cereal grains in Asia have 
 been done/tried, guesses of income elasticities have varied widely depending on the type of data used and the (detailed description of exactly what is required) of the demand 
 model. For example, Table 1 shows that income elasticities of rice guessed from thin slice household data tend to be higher than those 
 based on group time-series data. In fact, the study by Ito, Peterson and 
 Grant (1989) using cross-country, time-series data in Asia points to/shows rela-

 tively low and (lowering in number/getting worse) income elasticities over time, leading to the 
 end/end result that rice is becoming an inferior good. While these results have 
 been changed by Huang, David and Duff (1991) by correcting the methodological problems, there are at least two weaknesses with now available guesses. First, the model (detailed description of exactly what is required) ignores the possible restrictions of demand relationship, and secondly, the effect of (related to what holds something together and makes it strong) changes 
 in the (process of people making, selling, and buying things) such as (city growth) has not been clearly specified. 
 In this paper, we examine whether and to what extent the rate of 
 (city growth) affected the patterns of cereal grains consumption in Asia. 
 We guess a complete demand system based on time-series (1960-1988) 
 group data from nine major rice growing countries. These are 
 Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, Japan, South 
 Korea and Pakistan, which together make up about 85% of the world's 
 rice consumption and production. 
 CEREAL GRAIN CONSUMPTION IN ASIA 
 
 Table 2 summarizes the once-a-year per-use of rice, wheat 
 and rough grains in nine selected Asian countries over the past three 
 20 years. Whereas rice consumption per person decreased significantly in 
 three countries - Bangladesh, Japan and Thailand, wheat consumption per 
 capita increased significantly in nearly all countries. In fact, it was only in 
 China and Indonesia, and less so the Philippines, where big increases in per person rice consumption were experienced. In India, 
 South Korea and Pakistan, rice consumption per person remained essen-

 tially the same. While (lowering in number/getting worse) (popular things/general ways things are going) for Japan and even Thailand may be 
 expected because of (compared to other things) high per person income, this is somewhat 
 unexpected for Bangladesh, which has one of the lowest per person incomes 
 in Asia. On the other hand, consumption of per person rough grains 
 decreased in most countries. The only exceptions are in Japan and the 
 Philippines, but this may be likely due to (problems, delays, etc.) in identifying the use 
 of rough grains between food and feed. Overall, Table 2 points to/shows that 
 over time, consumption of wheat increases relative to rice, and especially 
 rough grains, where consumption per person generally (lowered in number/got worse/gotten worse) in total 
 terms. The increase in per-use of wheat was bigger in China, Bangladesh, India and South Korea. 
 There is a common belief that wheat is substituted for rice as income 
 grows. However, thin slice household survey data (Table 3) point to/show 
 that per person rice consumption is larger at higher-income levels in both 
 the city-based  and areas away from cities. On the other hand, per person rice consumption 
 in the city-based  part/area is much lower than in the (away from cities) part/area. This 
 pattern may have two explanations. First, demand for more conveniently 
 ate/destroyed food is greater in the city-based  areas where both (husband or wife)s usually 
 work outside the home, travel time between work and home are large, and 
 cost of household help is higher than in the areas away from cities. Because wheat is 
 usually ate/destroyed in the form of commercially supplied bread and instant 
 noodles which can be easily (bought something for money) and ate/destroyed, it offers big 
 time savings for the household. Secondly, farming-based labor needs/demands more 
 physical energy and so calorie inputs than industrial work. At a given 
 income, (away from cities) people will have a greater demand for the cheaper food 
 per calorie, such as cereal grains, or even roots and tubers to maintain the 
 calorie needed things for survival/income. 1 (based on facts and other evidence), changes in the rate of 
 (city growth) together with changes in relative prices and income will affect 
 consumption patterns of cereal grains in Asia. 
 MODEL AND DATA 
 
 Idea-based model 
 The Almost Ideal Demand System (Deaton and Muellbauer, 1980) in 
 linear form (LA/ AIDS) has been used as a basic model and extended to 
 
 1 Consumption and price data for the roots, tubers, animal products and vegetables are not 
 available for most countries studied. Therefore, the substitution effects between these 
 valuable things and cereal grains are not examined clearly in this study.

 cereal grains except rice. 
 Sources: Bangladesh data are from They (1988, table 9), Philippines from Quisumbing et al. 
 (1988, table 56), and others from Bouis (1989, tables 55, 56, 58).

 where w is the budget share, Y is expense or income, pj is valuable thing 
 price, i and j are valuable thing indices, at, f3t and "'j are limits/guidelines to be 
 guessed, and P is the price index defined as In P = &#126;i wi In PiÂ· 
 When using time-series data, equation (1) may be misspecified due to 
 (something left out) of the effects of (city growth) on consumption patterns between 
 total cereal grains and all other valuable things, and among cereal grains. To 
 simplify the analysis, the limits/guidelines a* and 3{ * in equation (1) are 
 
 112 
 
 J. HUANG AND C.C. DAVID 
 
 assumed to be linear functions of Z, where Z is a (number or thing that changes) representing 
 (city growth). 2 This means that (act of something getting bigger, wider, etc.) of the city-based  part/area in the 
 (process of people making, selling, and buying things) shifts the (stopping or interfering with something) and the slope of real income over time. 
 The hit/effect of Z can then be specified with respect to equation (1) as: 
 
 wi = ai + a;z + &#126;/Yij ln Pj + (f3i 
 
 + 3{;Z) ln(YjP) 
 
 (2) 
 
 where a, a', 3{, 3'{ and y are unknown limits/guidelines to be guessed. 
 Existence of moves/changes in limits/guidelines caused by (city growth) may be tested by 
 examining whether or not a;= 0 and 13; = 0. Adding-up needs/demands &#126; a;= 0 
 and &#126; 13; = 0. 
 To calculate the elasticities of income or expense (eiy), price (ei), 
 and (city growth) (eiz), the following formulas are used: 3 
 
 eiy = 
 
 1 + (f3i + 3{;Z)jwi- (f3i + 3{;Z)jwi[ &#126;wk 
 
 ln Pk( eky- 
 
 1)]_) 
 
 (3) 
 
 eij= -oij+yijjwi-(f3i+3{;Z)jwi[wj+&#126;wk ln pk(ekj+okj)]_) 
 
 (4) 
 
 eiz = Zjwi[ a;+ 13; ln(YjP) - f3;&#126;wk ln pkekz] 
 
 (5) 
 
 where oij is the Kronecker delta. The incon:e and price elasticities for the 
 standard model, (in other words) equation (1) without (city growth) (numbers that change/things that change), can be 
 received/got by (impressive/forcing (on people)/causing an inconvenient situation) 13; = 0 in equations (3) and (4), (match up each pair of items in order). Almost the same 
 to the property of income elasticities or Engel Grouping condition, the 
 sum of weighted (city growth) elasticities for related valuable things will be 
 zero, (in other words), &#126;i wieiz = 0. 
 
 Guess procedure and data 
 For scientific guess, the following (random/including random data points) structure of equation 
 (2) is specified: 
 
 (6) 
 where t indexes time, and uit is the error term. 
 (thinking about/when one thinks about) the problem of data availability and the number of limits/guidelines to be guessed, the demand system was guessed in two stages. In the 
 first stage, valuable things have been grouped broadly into two, namely cereal 
 grains, and non-cereal products (that are bought and sold)  which include all other valuable things besides 
 We assume that only a;* and 3{;* but not Yii are affected by the (city growth) (number or thing that changes) Z to 
 avoid some econometric problems. However, this (detailed description of exactly what is required) should not be thought about/believed as 
 too (serving to severely limit or control) an idea (you think is true), since change in 3{;* can reflect both changes in income and 
 price elasticities as we will see from the ability to stretch formulas presented later. 
 3 The ability to stretch formulas for LA/ AIDS model are received/made from based on the studies by Green 
 and Alston (1990) and Huang and David (1991).

 cereal grains. Because the demand system expressed in budget share form 
 is amazing/single, only one equation (total cereal grain demand) is guessed. If 
 (one after the other) relationship in the error terms is watched/followed, the first-order autoregressive model or first-difference equation is used to guess the total cereal 
 grain demand function for each country. 
 In the second stage, the model consists only of cereal grains disaggregated into rice, wheat and rough grains. The (work of art/artistic combining of elements) of rough grains 
 which included corn, grain, (grass grown for food), rye, millet and other mixed grains 
 differed by country. The error term u; 1 in equation (6) is a random (number or thing that changes) 
 making happy the following conditions: 
 
 E(u; 1 ) = 0 
 E(uituit,)=f!ij 
 E(uituit')=O 
 
 for 
 for 
 
 t=t' 
 
 (7) 
 
 t=l=t' 
 
 If the Durbin-Watson test showed that the error terms in most of the 
 equations are (one after the other)ly related, the first-difference equation is guessed. 
 Repeating/repetitive (appearing to be) Unrelated (moving backwards) (SUR) or Repeating/repetitive Zellner 
 Guess procedures (IZE) (Zellner, 1962, 1963) are used directly or 
 after the (numbers that change/things that change) have been changed by the first difference. A few 
 authors including Kmenta and Gilbert (1968) and Namesen and Manser 
 (1977) have noted that the IZE procedure is equal to maximum 
 chance guesses of linear equations systems. 4 
 Data on consumption (availability) of cereal grains were gotten from 
 the United States Department of Farming (USDA) which is based on 
 supply-use (money-based records of a company) in each country. 5 Because government 
 stocks and feed use of cereal grains are not reported for many countries in 
 the USDA data base, data on consumption of rough grains are likely 
 overstated, which should be kept in mind when understanding/explaining the results. 
 The ratio of city-based  to total population is from the United Nations. Data on 
 
 With both matching restrictions and repeating/repetitive procedure, the guess comes together to full 
 information maximum chance methods. Because the former needs/demands the use of information across equations, the variance and covariance play important roles in guess, and 
 the last thing just mentioned comes together to maximum chance method as stated above. Otherwise, the 
 Zellner's guess procedure reduces to single equation ordinary least squares (OLS). 
 5 The other choice international source of cereal grain consumption data is the Food and 
 Farming Organization of the United Nations (FAO). Both are mostly based on official 
 supply-use (money-based records of a company) from (pertaining to each person or thing) governments, but the U.S. Department of 
 Farming has made more changes on official country statistics when these are 
 thought of unreliable or (in the past) (not agreeing/not happening in the same way) (Paulino and Tseng, 1980). Although consumption data for the nine selected Asian countries are quite consistent between FAO and 
 USDA, we used the USDA data because FAO's published data refer to 3-year averages.

 population and private consumption expenses (PCE) are mainly from 
 the International Money-based Fund (IMF, different issues), Asian Development Bank (ADB, different issues) and World Bank (World Tables, different 
 issues), except for China which are taken from Beijing Review Press (1990). 
 To get the grouped price index of all cereal grains, the geometric 
 mean is calculated, using the personal price index as substitute for the price of 
 non-cereal valuable things. All price data are from different official country 
 sources including: Bangladesh (related to studying numbers) Yearbook, India Directorate of 
 Money flow and Statistics, (related to studying numbers) Yearbook of Indonesia, (related to studying numbers) 
 Yearbook of the Ministry of Farming (Japan), Money-based Statistics 
 Yearbook of Korea, Yearbook of Farming and Forestry Statistics (Seoul), 
 25 years of Pakistan in 1947-72 and Pakistan (related to studying numbers) Yearbook, Bureau 
 of Farming-based Statistics and Central Bank of the Philippines, and China 
 State (related to studying numbers) Bureau. 
 RESULTS 
 
 Demand systems are guessed with the (something forced on people/an inconvenient situation) of evenness and 
 matching conditions suggested by demand explanation. Tests of demand restrictions are happy when (city growth) effects are specified but generally 
 rejected in the standard model where (city growth) is left-out. The guess results of the first-stage model as well as the suggested demand elasticities of total cereal grains are reported and discussed briefly in Add on 1. 
 Table 4 shows the guess results of the second-stage cereal grain 
 demand model. 6 The (related to studying numbers) results are very good with most of 
 the coefficients having the expected signs and reasonable high levels. The 
 goodness of fit measured by R 2 is generally high except for wheat in China. 
 The low R 2 for China may be due to the number of (numbers-based) 
 restricting so that income, prices and (city growth) alone do not fully explain 
 consumption levels of these valuable things. 
 The coefficients of rice price tend to be more (meaningful numbers) than 
 those for wheat and rough grains. Given the most important role of rice in 
 the Asian diet, changes in the price of rice will significantly affect the 
 budget shares of all cereal grains. The generally unimportant coefficients of 
 real cereal expense point to/show that the budget share of individual cereal 
 grains is not sensitive to changes in the total cereal expenses, but 
 To get all the (connected/related) (related to studying numbers) information for all three equations without meeting amazingness problem, two different pair-wise demand equations are guessed, (in other words) 
 ricejwheat and then ricejcoarse grains. The results show that guesses are invariant to 
 the equation that is dropped. To simplify Table 4, only rice and wheat demand equations 
 are reported.

 consumption may be significantly affected by those changes. This is because of the (happening together) effects of total cereal expense and price on 
 the relative budget share (wi = piqJY). For example, holding price constant, the consumption level (q) will increase (decrease) by the same 
 proportion as income (Y), leaving the budget share (w) unchanged. 
 To examine the existence of (city growth) effect, Table 5 reports the 
 results of the Wald chi-square tests which showed that (city growth) shifted 
 the (stopping and interfering with things) in five out of nine Asian countries at the 5% importance 
 level, (in other words), Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Pakistan and Thailand. Except in 
 Thailand, the slopes of real total cereal expense have also significantly 
 changed in these countries. The overall Wald tests point to/show that (city growth) has had a significant hit/effect in seven (i.e. Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Pakistan and Thailand) out of nine countries. The 
 unimportant result in China may be due firstly to the slow rate of (city growth) over the period of study as interregional traveling was highly restricted; and secondly, to the system of grain restricting that limited person choices. In the Philippine case, the unimportant coefficient of the 
 (city growth) ratio may be due to the (compared to other things) higher relationship between 
 the real income and (city growth) which increased the variances of guesses more than in other countries.

 a Total expense elasticities of rice, wheat and rough grains are the product of total 
 cereal expense ability to stretch received/got from stage I and cereal expense ability to stretch from 
 stage II. IFPRI's guesses (1976) on total cereal expense elasticities are used for 
 Bangladesh (0.48), India (0.47), and Pakistan (0.23). 
 b Rough grains. 
 c Elasticities are calculated for those countries where the guessed limits/guidelines are (meaningful numbers). 
 
 Table 4. Except for rough grains in China and Pakistan, all the own-price 
 elasticities have the correct signs. The generally higher (value of a number, ignoring its sign)s of 
 un-paid-for own-price elasticities for rice compared to wheat and 
 rough grains would mostly reflect the greater income effects of a price

 change in rice which rules total cereal expense in most of the 
 countries. 
 A few patterns may be watched/followed with respect to the total expense 
 elasticities for individual grains. The total expense ability to stretch for rice 
 remains positive ranging from 0.25 (Philippines) to 0.53 (India) in seven out 
 of the nine Asian countries. The negative total expense ability to stretch of 
 demand for rice in Japan, which has one of the world's highest per person 
 incomes, is to be expected. The negative ability to stretch for Thailand is also 
 reasonable as the country now has the highest per person income among 
 South and Southeast Asia. The (compared to other things) high ability to stretch for South Korea is 
 due partly to the fact that moves/changes in consumption from grain to rice have 
 happened as income increased and partly to the overestimate of total 
 expense ability to stretch of demand for total cereal grains in the first stage of 
 this study. 
 The total expense elasticities for wheat are positive in all countries 
 except for Japan. However, wheat does not appear to be preferred over 
 rice as proven true by the lower total expense ability to stretch for wheat 
 compared to rice in India, Indonesia, Pakistan and the Philippines. Japan is 
 the only country where all cereal grains are thought of as inferior products (that are bought and sold), but 
 the (value of a number, ignoring its sign)s of the expense elasticities are (compared to other things) low. 
 It should be noted that guessed total expense elasticities of demand for rough grains may be overstated because of underestimation of 
 feed use, which lead to overestimation of food consumption in the data 
 used. 
 (city growth) elasticities 
 
 The ability to stretch of (city growth) is defined as the percentage change in 
 demand due to a percentage change in the ratio of city-based  to total population. Agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with expectations, (city growth) has generally negative 
 effects on consumption of rice and rough grains, but positive effects on 
 wheat consumption. 
 Japan has the most negative (city growth) ability to stretch (- 0.34) of demand 
 for rice, which hints that (something left out) of (city growth) (number or thing that changes) in the 
 (detailed description of exactly what is required) of cereal grain demand models for Japan will lead to a 
 downward bias in guessed income or expense ability to stretch. The highly 
 negative (city growth) ability to stretch (- 0.24) in India, which is next only to 
 Japan, can partly explain why per person rice consumption in India remained (compared to other things) unchanged over the last thirty years. Also, the 
 decrease in per person rice consumption by 28 kg in Bangladesh (even though there is the existence of) the 
 (compared to other things) high expense ability to stretch during the last thirty years may 
 partly be explained by the negative effects of (city growth) on rice demand

 in this country. 7 The (city growth) ability to stretch of rice in Pakistan is also 
 negative but small in importance because rice is not a staple food in this 
 country. More than that, unlike in other Asian countries, wheat is not generally 
 ate/destroyed as commercial breads, and therefore is not necessarily more 
 convenient to consume than rice. Thailand also has a negative ability to stretch, 
 but the importance is unexpectedly low. The positive (city growth) elasticities in South Korea is unexpected and may suggest that the substitution of 
 rice for grain happened not only because of higher income but also because 
 of the higher rate of (city growth). 
 In contrast to rice and rough grains, (city growth) elasticities for wheat 
 are all positive with (compared to other things) high (value of a number, ignoring its sign)s. Therefore, watched/followed 
 growth in wheat consumption over time in all countries is due not only to 
 increases in income but also to the growing (city growth). Because wheat is 
 the staple food in Pakistan, the (city growth) ability to stretch is (compared to other things) small 
 (0.29). The low ability to stretch received/got for South Korea (0.27) is explained by 
 the different nature of substitution among cereal grains in this country. 
 Whereas wheat is usually substituted for rice as (city growth) increases, 
 the substitution of rice for grain was also important in this country during 
 this period. In general, countries with small initial budget shares of wheat 
 have higher (city growth) elasticities. 
 For rough grains, (city growth) had negative effects on consumption in 
 all countries studied. The negative signs are because wheat as 
 well as rice are usually more (easy to get to, use, or understand) and convenient to consume than 
 rough grains. (something left out) of (city growth) (numbers that change/things that change) in the analysis of demand 
 for rice, wheat and rough grains may therefore tend to underestimate 
 income or expense elasticities for rice and rough grains while overestimating them for wheat. 
 As shown in Table 1, guesses of income elasticities based on thin slice data are usually much higher than those based on time-series 
 group data. Even when the guess problems in IPG's time-series 
 analysis which lead to downward bias in guessed income ability to stretch have 
 been corrected by HDD, guesses in the last column are still below those 
 from thin slice data. All of these time-series guesses, however, are 
 based on single equation models that specify only income and relative 
 prices as (things that you control (like study times), that cause other things to change (like test scores)). When (city growth) and (dependent on each other) 
 of rice and all other valuable things in the (process of people making, selling, and buying things) are accounted for in the 
 
 Aside from the effects of (city growth), production moves/changes from rice to wheat may have 
 increased home consumption of wheat grains over the last thirty years in Bangladesh. 
 This follows from Bouis (1990) guess that greater (making something available for lots of people to buy) of a cereal grain 
 will tend to reduce its consumption. 
 7

 analysis as done in this paper, guesses of income elasticities based on 
 time series become almost always the same with guesses from cross section 
 data. For example, our expense ability to stretch of demand for rice in 
 Bangladesh is 0.38, which is close to the thin slice guess by Bouis 
 (0.34-0.83) and much higher than time-series guesses by IPG (- 0.04) 
 and HDD (0.08). (in almost the same way), time-series guesses of expense elasticities 
 of demand for rice in this study are quite similar with those guessed 
 by thin slice data in China, India, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, 
 Pakistan, Philippines and Thailand. The (something left out) of (city growth) (number or thing that changes) 
 which is usually positively related to income, therefore, leads to 
 underestimation of income ability to stretch in time-series analysis. 
 CONCLUSIONS 
 
 (city growth) has significantly affected patterns of Asian cereal grains 
 consumption. Its effects on total cereal grains may differ by country 
 according to income levels. In high-income countries, it has been watched/followed 
 that (city growth) increased (a lot) the consumption of other noncereal products (that are bought and sold)  and decreased cereal grains consumption, whereas (city growth) increased cereal grain consumption in poor countries. 
 Among cereal grains, (city growth) has had negative effects on consumption of rice and rough grains but positive effects on wheat consumption. 
 The positive effects of (city growth) on demand for wheat are regularly 
 watched/followed for all countries because of the greater convenience of using/eating 
 wheat products. Therefore, continuing increases in wheat consumption 
 over time are due not only to increases in income, but also due to those 
 (city growth) effects. Among the countries studied, only Japan and Thailand have negative income elasticities of demand for total cereal grains. 
 Rice remains a need and a (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) good in all countries except these 
 countries. 
 A review of the existing studies of rice demand in Asia shows/tells about that 
 time-series data tend to create lower guesses of rice income elasticities 
 than thin slice data. This study has shown that when the effects of 
 (city growth) are taken into account, guesses of income elasticities for 
 rice based on time-series data become agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with those from thin slice data. In order to improve projections of future demand for cereal 
 grains, therefore, changes in the rate of (city growth) as well as income 
 must be taken into account.

 CEREAL GRAINS IN ASIA 
 
 123 
 
 APPENDIX 1 
 
 Add on Table 1 presents the guess results of the first-stage model 
 as well as the suggested demand elasticities for total cereal grains. Bangladesh 
 and Pakistan as well as India have been left out/kept out from the first-stage 
 analysis because of unreliable data on private consumption expense in 
 the 1960s when the former two countries were not yet separated, and lack 
 of data for the last thing just mentioned. With the exception of Japan and Thailand, the total 
 expense elasticities of demand for cereal grains are positive. Indonesia 
 has the highest expense elasticities of total cereal grains (0.51), followed by South Korea (0.50) and China (0.41). 
 (city growth) effect is still in favor of cereal grains consumption in some 
 poor countries such as China and the Philippines. This may be due 
 to the high substitutability of cereal grains for inferior root crops such as 
 sweet potatoes and cassava. On the other hand, (city growth) reduces 
 cereal grains consumption in those countries where income levels are high 
 such as Japan and South Korea. This hints that (city growth) causes 
 substitution between cereals and other food such as animal products. The 
 effects of (city growth) on total cereal grain consumption are unimportant 
 in India, Indonesia and Thailand.
