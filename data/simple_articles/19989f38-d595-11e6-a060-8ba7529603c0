 Abstract 
 This paper intends to guess tbe possible result of climate change on Taiwan's farming-based part/area. Yield response moving backward models are used to (ask lots of questions about/try to find the truth about) the climate change's hit/effect on 60 crops. A price-endogenous mathematical programming 
 model is tben used to test out tbe welfare hits/effects of yield changes under different climate change pictures/situations. Results suggest 
 that both warming and climate differences/different versions have a significant but non-monotonic hit/effect on crop yields. All people 
 would not suffer from warming, but a (rain, snow, etc.) increase may be terrible to farmers.Â© 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

 1. Introduction 
 
 Farming has been a central focus of policy discussions and research projects dealing with money-based 
 effects of pollution (that heats up the Earth) emission control plans. 
 Climate is a major (thing that decides something) of both the location 
 and working well of farming-based activities. Significant research efforts are now happening to (ask lots of questions about/try to find the truth about) 
 agriculture's ability to change, because it is important 
 to "understand how much to control worldwide  pollution (that heats up the Earth) (things sent out or given off) and to measure what actions would 
 make farming more tough" (Reilly, 1999, p. 4). 
 (large/relatively large) progress has been made in testing the possible effects of climate change on worldwide 
 farming (Kane et al., 1992; Rosenzweig and Avoid, 
 1994; Darwin et al., 1995). However, significant uncertainties remain (Reilly, 1995) and concern has

 moved/changed to (related to a large area) effects (e.g. Adams et al., 1990, 
 1993; Mendelsohn et al., 1994 on US farming) or 
 farm-level hits/effects (e.g. Kaiser et al., 1993; Easterling 
 et al., 1993). Adams et al. (1998) provides a thorough review on the (things that are almost the same as other things) and differences in the 
 research of climate change on farming. In general, the money-based effects change/differ  across both crops and 
 areas, just as the changes in physical crop yields 
 do. Including human (able to change and get better) responses is very important to 
 a valid test and sometimes even reverses 
 the direction of the net money-based effect. 
 The books reviewed by Adams et al. (1998) (focuses mental and physical effort) on the CERES family of crops (Ritchie et al., 
 1989) produced in North and Latin American countries, because scientific test for other crops 
 produced in other places in the world is thinly distributed. While the 
 agreement is that the (possibility of/possible happening of)  crop yield reduction is greatest in warmer, lower (north-south position/freedom) areas and 
 semi-dry areas of the world (referred to in Rosenzweig and 
 Iglesias, 1994; IPCC, 1996 and Smith et al., 1996),

 the money-based results of crop yield reductions 
 in these areas are mostly unexplored. To fill this scientific gap, this study tests the possible results 
 from climate change on the farming-based part/area of an 
 (process of people making, selling, and buying things) located in the semi-(related to areas near the Equator/hot and humid) area-Taiwan. 
 The results show not only the sensitivity of farming to climate change in this area, but also the 
 possible money-based results which can help us in 
 understanding the importance of the (able to change and get better) behavior 
 that is available to deal with these changes. 
 Taiwan is located between 21.7 and 25.5Â° northem (north-south position/freedom) and has a total area of 3.6 million ha. A 
 central mountain chain runs along the up-and-down axis of 
 the island, with the land rising from a lOOm foothill 
 to a mountain range of 3000 m being only within a 
 flat/left-and-right distance of 50-60 km. So, the location 
 of this mountain chain decides/figures out the distribution of 
 farming-based land. The total (helped to grow) land in 1996 
 was 0.87 millionha, or 24% of the total land area, 
 with paddy fields amounting to 0.46 million ha and 
 dryland 0.41 millionha. Of all the paddy fields, about 
 75% are in the watered area managed by the crop-watering/rinsing with water association. 
 Taiwan's subtropical weather permits the growing 
 of a great variety of crops. In the summer months the 
 temperature in southern and northern Taiwan is almost 
 identical (27-28 Â°C). During the winter months, the 
 mean temperature is about 5 oc higher in the south 
 (20 Â°C) than that in the north (15 Â°C). Although, the 
 rainfall distribution is extremely affected by mountains, land, rivers, etc., the once-a-year rainfall in the main crop production area ranges from 1500 to 2000mm, with rainfall 
 plentiful throughout the island from May to October. 
 During the winter months, the rainy season wins in 
 the northern and eastern areas while the central and 
 southern parts of the west coast have dry and sunny 
 weather. Given warm and humid weather, many kinds 
 of crops can be grown to produce a wide variety of 
 farm products on the island (Cheng, 1975). 
 In this study we will put into use the "(related to what holds something together and makes it strong)" approach 
 in Adams et al. (1999) which incorporates the yield 
 effects of climate change directly into a part/area-wide 
 money-based model with different levels of farm helpful change possibilities. We start by using multiple moving backward 
 models to (ask lots of questions about/try to find the truth about) the hit/effect of climate change 
 on Taiwan's crop yields. The coefficient guesses are 
 used to (describe the future) yield changes under different climate 
 change pictures/situations. An scientific Taiwan farming-based 
 
 part/area model (after now called TASM) is then employed to test the hit/effect of crop yield changes 
 on farming-based production, land use, welfare distribution, as well as the potentials for farming to change 
 to climate changes. 
 This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 
 presents the scientific results of the crop produce response (moving backwards). In Section 3 an summary of 
 the structure and data of TASM are illustrated. In 
 Section 4 the welfare effects/results/suggestions of different climate change pictures/situations are tested and Section 5 
 summarizes the results. 
 
 2. Yield response moving backward 
 A few previous studies have guessed the hit/effect 
 of climate on crop yields, however, most studies have 
 focused on selected crops (e.g. Andresen and Land, 
 1989; Dixon et al., 1994; Kaufmann and Snell, 1997 
 on com; Wu, 1996 on rice). Inter-crop comparisons 
 are not available. To help our part/area-wide test, a complete crop yield response study for 
 60 crops is managed and did/done for Taiwan. 
 Crop yield response models are usually guessed 
 from field data using the measurement of climate and 
 non-climate-related (numbers that change/things that change) to identify the physical 
 effect of climate change on yield. To think about  farmers' 
 helpful change, this paper adopts a multiple moving backward 
 model for crop yields that (combines different things together so they work as one unit) the physical and 
 social (things that decide other things) of yield. Average yields from 15 
 sub-areas (or supervisorures) in Taiwan for the years 
 1977 through 1996 are used in our (moving backwards). The 
 general form of this model is given by Eq. (1) as 
 follows: 1 
 yield= f(climate, technology, management, land) 
 
 1 Price (numbers that change/things that change) are not included in our model, because we 
 did not put into use the (two things existing together) approach as done in Segerson and 
 Dixon (1999). Therefore, our yield guesses should be viewed as 
 (for only a short time) (statements about the future). No helpful change in management practices to 
 offset the bad effect of climate change is carefully thought about/believed here. 
 Therefore, some overestimation on the negative effect (or underestimation on the positive) of climate change might happen. However, helpful changes are allowed in terms of changing crop mixes in 
 the later part of our analysis when TASM is used to test out the 
 effect of climate change on land usage and welfare distribution. 
 
 C.-C. Chang/Agricultural Money flow 27 (2002) 51-64 
 
 where yield is per area of land  yield, climate and land represent climate and soil conditions and do not lend 
 themselves to control by decision makers. 
 In this study average temperature and (rain, snow, etc.) 
 are carefully thought about/believed as the major climate factors, with the 
 average slope being used as a substitute for the (features/ qualities/ traits) of land. Both technology and management are 
 carefully thought about/believed as planned factors under the control of 
 producers. Time (popular thing/general way things are going) is used to represent the level of 
 technology. The management factor connected with 
 crop yield is proxied by the ratio of full-time farm 
 families to total farm families in the area. This 
 (number or thing that changes) intends to take by force/take control of the extent to which farm 
 operators in a given area give/reserve their effort to farming and get their job from it (Segerson and 
 Dixon, 1999). 
 Under the general setup, a seasonal moving backward 
 model is specified to reflect the relationship between 
 weather and the growth stage of crops as follows: 
 Y 
 
 =f 
 
 (TEMPs, TEMP;, RAINs, RAIN;, VTEMPs, 
 
 VRAINs, MANAs, TIME, SLOPE) 
 where subscripts s (s = 1-4) are the seasonal identifiers. The explanatory (numbers that change/things that change) include: TEMPs, 
 seasonal mean of monthly average temperature (0 C); 
 RAINs, seasonal mean of monthly average (rain, snow, etc.) (mm); VTEMPs, difference/different version of seasonal mean temperature from 20 years seasonal average; VRAINs, 
 difference/different version of seasonal mean (rain, snow, etc.) from 20 years 
 seasonal average; MANA, percentage of full-time in 
 total farm families (%), TIME, time (popular thing/general way things are going); and 
 SLOPE, land slope (% ). 
 This model adopts a non-linear (detailed description of exactly what is required) for 
 each climate (number or thing that changes) where linear and quadratic 
 terms are used as move backwardors, reflecting the effect 
 of a body-related best on yield. For example, a positive coefficient for the linear term and 
 a negative coefficient for the quadratic term point to/show that an (middle-position) value has the greatest positive effect on yield (Kaufmann and Snell, 
 1997). It also allows for a non-monotonic relationship between climate and yield, (in other words) a warming 
 up might increase crop yields in cooler areas but 
 decrease yields in warmer areas (Segerson and 
 Dixon, 1999). However, collinearity problems arise 
 from including in something of these quadratic terms. Therefore, 
 the results should be understood/explained carefully and the

 importance level of the coefficient guesses are 
 unreliable. 
 Different things than/different versions of temperature (VTEMs) and (rain, snow, etc.) (VRAINs) from their historical means are also 
 included to take by force/take control of the effect of an extreme event 
 on yield. 2 Previous studies (e.g. Shaw et al., 1994; 
 Mendelsohn et al., 1996) show that leaving out the difference/different version terms (created unfair thinking in)/(unfair-thinking) the effect of the worldwide  warming. 
 Therefore, these climate difference/different version terms are added in 
 our yield moving backward model. 
 A semi-logrithmic functional form is used where 
 all the (things that you control (like study times), that cause other things to change (like test scores)) (except the time trend 
 (number or thing that changes)) are changed by taking their logs. The 
 model is guessed with combined time-series and 
 thin sliceal data for 59 crops from 15 sub-areas 
 over the period 1977-1996. Table 1 displays the 
 (related to a large area) and sub-(related to a large area) (detailed descriptions of exactly what is required). Taiwan is 
 divided into four major crop areas by (related to where mountains, rivers, cities, etc., are located) locations, and within each area there are 3-4 
 sub-areas. The data on crop produces /gives up are drawn from 
 the Taiwan Farming-based Yearbook. Monthly weather 
 data on temperature and (rain, snow, etc.) are received/got 
 from Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau. Once-a-year data 
 on the number of full-time and total farm families 
 are taken from the Taiwan Farming-based Yearbook. 
 Data on slopes are calculated by averaging the data 
 reported in The Statistics and Graphical Summary of 
 the Soil Conditions and Proper Cropping Systems in 
 Taiwan's (helped to grow) Land (Lin and Tsai, 1994). 
 2 It should be noted that there exist other choice (detailed descriptions of exactly what is required) 
 for the climate difference/different version (number or thing that changes). The (numbers that change/things that change) used in our study 
 are measured differently from those in Mendelsohn et al' s. (1999) 
 study. We calculate the mistakes of seasonal average temperatures and (rain, snow, etc.) from their corresponding sample means for 
 each sample period, while Mendelsohn et a!. (1999) use the difference between the highest and lowest month! y temperatures and 
 (rain, snow, etc.) over the whole sample period in their thin slice 
 study. Although, the main concern in both studies is about the 
 extreme event, the measures differ due to differences in model 
 scope and data availability.

 The summary statistics are presented in Table 2. 
 Over the past 20 years, the temperature difference/different version is 
 obviously less dramatic than the differences/different versions in (rain, snow, etc.). In Figs. 1 and 2, (related to a large area) differences on once-a-year 
 average temperature and (rain, snow, etc.) are presented. 
 Both the southern and eastern areas have above average temperature, while their (rain, snow, etc.) levels are 
 mostly below average. 
 Since the combining data is used, the error terms 
 may be related across time and individual units. 
 So, the error terms consist of three parts/pieces: 
 a thin slice, a time-series, and a combined error 
 part. We adopt the idea (you think is true) that the error terms are thin sliceally independent, but are 
 timewise autocorrelated. A generalized least square 
 procedure described in Kmenta (1986, pp. 618-622) 
 is used to get consistent guesses. 3 
 For most crops, the model tends to have pretty 
 good explanatory power as measured by the Buse 
 Raw-moment R 2 , including rice. However, for wheat, 
 (grass grown for food), soybeans, potato, a few vegetables (scallop

 bulb, cabbage, etc.) and fruits (grape, apple, coconut, 
 etc.), the model does not (do as expected) very well. 
 For the non-climate (numbers that change/things that change), the management factor (i.e. the percentage of full-time farms) has a very 
 significant and good effect on yields for most 
 crops. Steeper land slopes are harmful to many crop 
 yields, in particular vegetables. Technology has, as 
 expected, a positive and significant effect on yields in 
 most cases. 
 As for the climate (numbers that change/things that change), since both linear and 
 quadratic terms are included in the model, elasticities are calculated to identify their not important yield hits/effects at the sample means. The results are shown 
 in Table 3. For rice (Taiwan's most important staple 
 crop), warmer temperatures and increased (rain, snow, etc.) are mostly yield-decreasing. Some studies 
 are also managed and did/done on the hit/effect of climate change 
 on rice yield using the data from field and/or laboratory controlled-experiments and different crop (testing out) models for many different countries. Matthews 
 et al. (1995) decide that many uncertainties exist due 
 to uncertainties in climate (statements about the future), limited places/locations for 
 which historical weather data are available, and quality of the crop (testing out) models. Anyway, the 
 result that a warming up would negatively/badly affect rice 
 yield is quite agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with those in Horie (1991) for 
 Japan and Wu (1996) for Taiwan. 
 A warming up also tends to be harmful to soybeans, adzuki beans, sugarcane, and many fruits like 
 bananas, pineapples, grapes, apples, etc. As for vegetables, temperature increases in the first and fourth 
 quarters are mostly good, but while it is not in the 
 second quarter. Too much rain is also bad/unhelpful to 
 their yields. Tomato produces /gives up are found to positively related to a temperature increase, and this is almost the same as the pattern used in Adams et al's. (1999) study 
 for US farming. 
 The climate hits/effects on citrus fruit change/differ  by species. 
 A temperature rise is good for ponkan, tankan and 
 wentan, but not for liucheng, lemon and grapefruits. 
 The yield changes used in Adams et al. (1999) ((at first/before other things happened) guessed by Ben-Mechlia and Carroll (1989a,b) 
 using the crop (testing out) models) for citrus produced 
 in the US show that a warming up may cause some 
 decreases in the southern areas, but shows increases 
 at more northerly places/locations. Our results suggest that differences in species should also be taken into account 
 beside locations.

 Climate differences/different versions are lastly found to have a significant yield hit/effect on many crops like corn, peanut, 
 (grass grown for food), sugarcane, sesame, scallop bulb, plant/wood, 
 cucumber, cantaloupe, banana, etc. (compared to other things) speaking, temperature differences/different versions seem to be more good to produces, while (rain, snow, etc.) differences/different versions are mostly 
 yield-decreasing. The last thing just mentioned is, a little bit, agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with the findings in Shaw et al. (1994) and 
 Mendelsohn et al. (1996). In other words, changes in 
 rainfall patterns can be helpful over some ranges, 
 but harmful over others. 
 In the review article by Adams et al. (1998), they 
 compare the climate effects on grain crops in Latin 
 and North America came/coming from different crop (testing out) models. Their comparison points to/shows that an important (related to a large area) (popular thing/general way things are going) exists. They also point out that 
 crop working well in large areas of Latin America is 
 negatively affected by the inter-once-a-year (quality of changing over time or at different places) and 
 the event of extreme events. Since both warming and greater climate (quality of changing over time or at different places) are found to have 
 a significant hit/effect on many crop yields in Taiwan, 
 their concern on the (related to a large area) food supply and welfare redistribution are possibly important and, this way, 
 should be explored. In the following sections we will 
 (ask lots of questions about/try to find the truth about) the money-based effects/results/suggestions of these yield 
 changes. 
 
 3. Structure of TASM 
 In this study a price-endogenous (related to space or existing in space) balance model (TASM) is used to test the hit/effect 
 of crop yield changes on (related to a large area) production, land 
 use, welfare distribution, as well as the potentials for 
 farming to change to fit climate changes. This section 
 describes the structure of TASM. The TASM is created in a multi-product partial balance (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) 
 based on the previous work ofBaumes (1978); Burton 
 and Martin (1987); McCarl and Spreen (1980); Chang 
 et al. (1992); Coble et al. (1992) and Tanyeri-Abur et 
 al. (1993). The scientific structure has been changed to fit 
 Taiwan and used in some policy-related studies, 
 e.g. Chang and Chen (1995) and Chang (1999). The 
 current version of TASM changes something (to helps someone)/takes care of someone more than 
 90 valuable things for four major production areas 
 which can be further divided into 15 sub-areas. 
 Under the perfect competitive and price-taking ideas (you think are true), price-dependent product demand and input 
 supply curves are used to copy market operations. 
 First, we assume that there exists I farming-based valuable things which are produced inK areas through production activities (i = 1, 2, ... , I; k = 1, 2, ... , K). The 
 unit of each activity is a hectare. The total production 
 in each area can be calculated by multiplying per 
 
 C.-C. Chang/Agricultural Money flow 27 (2002) 51-64 
 
 58 
 
 hectare yield with. For product demand, we assume all 
 valuable things are sold in the wholesale markets. The 
 prices faced by people can be represented by the 
 national average of wholesale prices. Assume demand 
 functions are integrable and can be represented by the 
 following inverse demand functions: 
 i = 1, 2, ... , I 
 
 (1) 
 
 PP 
 
 where Qi is the total amount of consumption and 
 the average wholesale price of valuable thing i. 
 In the input markets we assume each production 
 activity must apply M (related to a large area) inputs (such as land 
 and labor) and N inputs (bought something for money) from the non-farm 
 part/area (such as (material that makes plants grow better) and chemicals). The prices 
 of N (bought something for money) inputs are (coming from the outside of something). However, the 
 prices of M (related to a large area) inputs are endogenously figured out by/decided by the received/made from demand from the production 
 activities and (related to a large area) supply functions. Assume 
 (related to a large area) supply functions are integrable as follows: 
 P/;,k = ak(Lmk), 
 
 m = 1, 2, ... , k 
 
 J 
 
 1/I(Qi) dQi- 
 
 l 
 
 max:&#126;

 J 
 
 1/J(Qi) dQi 
 
 + P 8 Qg 
 
 l 
 
 - L L cikxik - L 
 
 (2) 
 
 where P/;,k are user prices of (related to a large area) inputs and are 
 the amount supplied. 
 The unemotional function which (makes as big as possible) the sum 
 of people' extra plus producers' (more than what's needed) is 
 used to test out a perfectly competitive market balance following Samuelson (1952); Takayama and 
 Judge (1964). It is defined as the area between the 
 product demand and factor supply curves to the left 
 of their intersection as follows: 
 
 max:&#126; 
 
 Terms pL, pQ, LK, and Xik are endogenous (numbers that change/things that change) 
 while Cik. Yik, and.fimk are known limits/guidelines. 
 The following two sets of policy (numbers that change/things that change) are also 
 added into the model. The first set is used to reflect the 
 government rice purchase program under a (promised that something will definitely happen or that something will definitely work as described) 
 price which is above the market balance price. An 
 import ban is used to promise farmers a reasonable return. A high (promised that something will definitely happen or that something will definitely work as described) price and tight restriction on 
 rice imports stimulate excess production resulting in 
 a fast collection of extra rice, a shortage of 
 elevator space, and an increasing government shortage. 
 Per hectare limits on rice (instances of buying things for money) have been done since 1977. Letting P! be the weighted 
 government (promised that something will definitely happen or that something will definitely work as described) (instances of buying things for money) price and the total 
 amount of government (instance of buying something for money), the unemotional function becomes

 The restrictions are also changed into:

 The restrictions are: 
 Qi - Lyikxik :::: 0 
 
 for all i 
 
 (4) 
 
 k 
 
 (5) 
 where Cik is the (bought) input cost in area k used 
 in producing the ith valuable thing, Yik the per hectare 
 yield of ith valuable thing produced in area k, and.fimk 
 the demand for the mth (related to a large area) input in area k. 
 
 The total amount from the government rice purchase 
 program (Pf Q&#126;) is added into the unemotional function 
 as added/more money/money income for the farmers. Eq. (7) represents the changed supply-demand balance condition for rice and Eq. (8) is for other products. Eq. (9) 
 remains unchanged. 
 The second set of policy (numbers that change/things that change) relates to the 
 trade protection (tools or objects used to do work or measure something) in Taiwan. Taiwan's 
 import/export share in the world market is very small. 
 Therefore, import and export prices are assumed to be 
 (coming from the outside of something)ly figured out by/decided by supply and demand in the 
 world market. The net trade balances are added into 
 the unemotional function directly to reflect the welfare

 In Eq. (10) the net trade values are added into the 
 unemotional function, where pm and px are import and 
 export prices, and Qm and Qx are export and import 
 amounts, (match up each pair of items in order). There are two types of valuable thing balance equations, one for traded and the other 
 for non-traded products. In Eq. (11) the demand of a 
 traded product is the sum of domestic demand (Qf) 
 and export demand ( Qj ), where the supply side includes the import supply (Qm )and domestic supply 
 (L,kYfkXfk)- Eq. (12) represents the demand-supply 
 balance of non-traded products (that are bought and sold)  as Eq. (13) remains the 
 same. 
 Now, two trade protection (tools or objects used to do work or measure something) (quota 
 and tax/import tax) are used to protect domestic farm products. 
 The quota systems are (forced (on people)/caused an inconvenient situation) on the imports of rice, 
 sugar, pork, and (related to chickens, hens, turkeys, etc.), etc. The import of beef and 
 fruits are under a tax/import tax protection system. In the model 
 the former is handled by (impressive/forcing (on people)/causing an inconvenient situation) an upper bound 
 for the import amount while the last thing just mentioned is treated by 
 adding an import tax upon domestic prices. 
 The TASM includes 60 crops, 5 floral crops, 7 
 animals, 3 types of forests (conifers, hardwoods, 
 and plant/wood) and 17 secondary valuable things (including two timber products: conifer-timber and 
 hardwood-timber). The total value of the first (or most important) 
 valuable things accounts for 85% of Taiwan's total value 
 
 of farming-based product. Table 4 provides the list of 
 valuable thing coverage. Sub-(related to a large area) production activities are specified in the model for each valuable thing. 
 Crop, animals and forestry mixes activities and restrictions are also specified at the sub-(related to a large area) level, but 
 the input markets for cropland, (area of grassy land) land, forest 
 land, and farm labor are specified at the (related to a large area) level. 
 The data sources mostly come from published government statistics and research reports, which include 
 the Taiwan Farming-based Yearbook, Production Cost 
 and Income of Farm Products Statistics, Valuable thing 
 Price Statistics Monthly, Taiwan Farming-based Prices 
 and Costs Monthly, Taiwan Area Farming-based Products Wholesale Market Yearbook, Trade Statistics of 
 the Inspectorate-General of Customs, Forestry Statistics of Taiwan. Demand elasticities of farming-based 
 products comes from different sources. They are listed 
 in the Add on of Lin (1996). 
 The scientific model is validated based on the comparison between the balance solution and actual 
 statistics. The year 1994 was chosen as the (a measure of what occurs naturally/sports boundary line) to 
 construct the information file, and we use both the total production and prices as the basis to validate our model. It 
 is found that most of the mistakes between model 
 results and 1994 data are within 5% range and so 
 the model should be valid for our (testing out). 
 
 4. Climate change (testing out) 
 The guessed elasticities of the quarterly model 
 in Table 3 are used to (describe the future) yield changes. Table 5 
 lists 11 combinations of different climate change

 pictures/situations, which include 0, + 1.5, +2.5 oc for temperature and -10, 0, + 7 and+ 15% for (rain, snow, etc.). 
 Because the data used in our study do not allow for 
 an guess of the effects of changes in C02, all 
 pictures/situations assume no change in the C02 level and 
 this way include no C02 fertilization effects. We also 
 assume that the temperature or (rain, snow, etc.) change 
 happens in all four seasons. So, in each picture/situation all 
 seasonal (numbers that change/things that change) are (changed to make better/changed to fit new conditions) (at the same time) by the 
 same amounts. Floral crops in TASM are assumed 
 to be unaffected by climate changes since most of 
 them are (helped to grow) inside (glass buildings where plants are grown). Animals and 
 (related to chickens, hens, turkeys, etc.) production in Taiwan has been changed 
 from backyard sideline operations into large business operations and mostly produced in the confined 
 (surrounding conditions). Due to limited exposure to the outside 
 (surrounding conditions), their produces /gives up as such are also assumed to 
 be unaffected by climate changes. 
 Another major hit/effect of climate change involves 
 input (change to make better/related to changing something) related to produce levels. Input usage is 
 (changed to make better/changed to fit new conditions) by the percentage change in yield times an 
 output ability to stretch expressing the response of input usage to a percentage change in yield. Arc ability to stretch of 
 input for selected crops in each sub-area is calculated using 1982 and 1972 production and crop budget data (Chang and Chen, 1995). An upper and lower 
 bound of 2.0 and -2.0 are set, (match up each pair of items in order), for elasticities beyond this range. In addition to changes in 
 the input usage coefficients, the (how much money is being made) of each 
 crop budget appearing in the unemotional function is also 
 (changed to make better/changed to fit new conditions) according to the percentage change in yield. 
 Using these projected yield changes and changes/recalculations in input usage and (how much money is being made), the money-based effects/results/suggestions of each of the 11 climate change 
 pictures/situations are tested using the TASM organized and listed in 
 Section 3. The percentage changes in people' and 
 producers' welfare from the 1984 (a measure of what occurs naturally/sports boundary line) are used 
 to represent the welfare effect of the climate change. 
 These changes are reported in Table 6. Our welfare 
 results suggest that the climate hits/effects on welfare 
 are mostly positive except for the first three pictures/situations 
 where no temperature increase is assumed. This hopeful result can be attributable mostly to the flexibility in TASM that allows farmers to change their crop 
 mixes and land use pattern for helpful change. 
 Table 7 illustrates the changes in land use pattern in 
 each climate change picture/situation. The total crop land 
 decreases about 1-6% in the warming up pictures/situations.

 Given the very limited availability of plantable land in 
 Taiwan, farmers can create more welfare from stronger land usage. Also, from the percentage 
 part results as shown in Table 7, there exists 
 significant (related to what holds something together and makes it strong) change, with planting land 
 declining for cereal crops. On the other hand, the 
 percentages on vegetables, pulse, and special crops increase. Therefore, given the possibility of helpful changes, 
 a climate change has the possible ability to  encourage more 
 production of vegetables and speciality crops. The 
 moves/changes from traditional crops to higher value-added 
 crops also add/give to the (compared to other things) large (acts of things getting bigger, wider, etc.) 
 on producers' welfare. 
 In the last thing just mentioned eight pictures/situations climate change seems 
 to have a almost the same  relative importance and pattern of hits/effects under both 1.5 and 2.5 oc temperature increase 
 pictures/situations. In both sets of pictures/situations, producers' welfare gains are much more dramatic than people' 
 in percentage terms. The results also point to/show that the 
 two climate (numbers that change/things that change) have different effects/results/suggestions for 
 people and producers. Temperature increases have 
 possible ability to  bring more benefits than (rain, snow, etc.) increases do. However, for people, the benefits are 
 not monotonic. A medium-level warming up is likely to be 
 welfare-improving for people while a harsh temperature rise may result in their welfare losses. Producers are better off from a more big rise, but 
 too much rainfall tends to reduce producers' welfare. 
 The overall people-related welfare effects/results/suggestions of a warming up are just like those reported in Adams et al. 
 (1999). Both studies show that a medium-level warming

 up benefits all people, but benefits fall as temperature rises beyond a 1.5 oc change. However, the 
 effects/results/suggestions of more (rain, snow, etc.) are different. More 
 (rain, snow, etc.) appears to be helpful for producers in 
 the US, but not necessarily so for those in Taiwan. 
 The results on producers are also almost the same as the 
 recent findings in Mendelsohn et al. (1999) in which 
 the Ricardian approach is used to test the relationship between net farm values and climate change. 
 In the earlier one by Mendelsohn et al. (1996) they 
 find that group farm value in the U.S. with a mild/not extreme climate pattern is hill-shaped with a maximum 
 of 63Â°F. So, they (describe the future) that only a small increase 
 in temperature raises farm values so that countries in 
 mild/not extreme and polar areas benefit while countries 
 in subtropical and (related to areas near the Equator/hot and humid) areas will suffer losses. 
 However, in their 1999 study climate differences/different versions are 
 added into their moving backward model and the new results 
 show that temperature increases are strictly helpful 
 to farm values in the US. 
 
 22 
 
 In our study climate differences/different versions are also added into 
 our yield response guesses. Almost the same  monotonic effects on producers' welfare are found. The possible 
 explanation is that climate change may cause changes 
 in crop mixes and land use pattern, along with the (match things up in a line again/cause to agree again)ments in market prices. Still, great caution should 
 be taken when applying these response functions to a 
 climate change outside the range of data used here. 
 
 5. Ending/deciding statements 
 This paper basically researches the hit/effect of climate change on the farming-based activities in the 
 semi-(related to areas near the Equator/hot and humid) area using Taiwan as an example. The 
 way(s) of doing things involves a two-step procedure. First, 
 combining data on crop produces and climate and other 
 non-climate-related (numbers that change/things that change) are used to guess 
 yield response equations. The yield equations are 
 used to test out the physical hits/effects of other choice 
 
 C.-C. Chang I Farming-based Money flow 27 (2002) 51-64 
 
 climate change pictures/situations on per hectare yields. This 
 approach addresses farmer's changes/recalculations to (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) conditions and so provides (compared to other things) more 
 realistic guesses of the importance of climate hits/effects 
 than do traditional (related to scientific farming) crop weather models. 
 Our scientific results on 60 crops in Taiwan show 
 that, in general, the two climate (numbers that change/things that change) (temperature and (rain, snow, etc.)) have a significant and 
 non-monotonic hit/effect on crop yields. Climate differences/different versions also have significant effects/results/suggestions on many crop 
 yields, like those found in the US. Therefore, 
 incorporating climate differences/different versions should be important 
 in studying climate hits/effects on farming in subtropical and (related to areas near the Equator/hot and humid) areas. The hit/effect of other 
 (related to areas near the Equator/hot and humid) (related to the Earth's weather) weird things, such as cyclones, El 
 Nino-southern-swinging and hurricanes, are also 
 very very important to the well-being in these areas and 
 should be explored in the future. Also, since 
 seasonal difference are found when examining the hit/effect of climate on crop yields, future research would 
 benefit with the availability of data on the time periods of time (or space) when crops enter into their different growth stages 
 as well as the growth-stage-related climate data. 
 In our second step the (described the future) yield changes are 
 included into a model of the Taiwanese farming-based part/area where prices are endogenously decided/figured out 
 and farmer's helpful changes are allowed by different crop 
 mixes, land use pattern and input uses in response to 
 price and yield changes. The welfare effects/results/suggestions of 
 different climate change pictures/situations are examined. The 
 comparison result hints that climate change hits/effects on welfare are mostly positive. The hits/effects on 
 producers are much more significant than they are on 
 people, with the two climate (numbers that change/things that change) found to 
 also have quite different effects/results/suggestions for people 
 and producers. A temperature rise is not stressful to 
 Taiwan's farmers, and may even be helpful when 
 helpful change is taken into account. However, the upward move/change in rainfall strength could be terrible to 
 farmers' welfare. 
 The hit/effect of climate change on farming is a 
 very complicated issue. Many analysts (describe the future) that 
 developing countries in (related to areas near the Equator/hot and humid) and semi-(related to areas near the Equator/hot and humid) 
 areas are the most able to be hurt by worldwide  warming. This paper presents a early/incomplete test on 
 Taiwan's (compared to other things) improved farming-based part/area. 
 Unfortunately, because the flexibility in land use, 
 the ability of farmers to change  and the existence of 
 
 63 
 
 helpful change possibilities change/differ, our results may not be 
 related to other neighboring Asian (processes of people making, selling, and buying things) directly. This leads to some possible research 
 directions such as comparing different helpful change plans available in (related to areas near the Equator/hot and humid) and semitropical 
 areas.
