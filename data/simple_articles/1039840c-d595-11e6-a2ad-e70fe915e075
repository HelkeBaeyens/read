 Abstract 
 This paper tries to identify sources of useful thing/valuable supply use inefficiency for cotton production in Pakistan's Punjab. The use 
 of a non-parametric method, Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), is developed to study the relative technical and allocative 
 (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) of individual farms which use almost the same  inputs, produce the same product and operate under similar facts or conditions (that surround someone). In the 'cotton-wheat' system of Pakistan, there are a lot of farms that are both technically and 
 allocatively inefficient. The use of DEA shows that the way of doing things provides a clear identification of both the extent and the 
 sources of technical and allocative inefficiencies in cotton production. However, both the (understanding/ explanation) of the farm level 
 results created and the projection of these results to a higher level require care, given the technical nature of the farming-based 
 production processes.Â© 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

 1. Introduction 
 
 A few recent studies on the technical and money-based (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) of crop production in Pakistan, 
 especially for wheat and rice, have pointed out the 
 existence of a 'yield gap'. This 'gap' refers to the 
 difference in working well on 'best practice' and on 
 other farms operating with similar useful thing/valuable supply gifts under the same conditions (Akhtar et 
 al., 1986; Ali and Flinn, 1987; Hussain et al., 1991; 
 Khan et al., 1994). Surprisingly, these studies have 
 ignored cotton, (even though there is the existence of) it being the major export from 
 Pakistan. 
 The existing studies on technical and money-based (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) have used the usual parametric meth* Corresponding author. Tel.: +44-118-931-8480;

 ods to guess 'average' (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) only (Khan and 
 Maki, 1979; Ali and Flinn, 1987; Ali and Chaudhry, 
 1990; Ali et al., 1993; Battese et al., 1993; Parikh and 
 Shah, 1994; Parikh et al., 1995). The guess of 
 such 'average' (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) appears to ignore the argument that the study of the individual farm is more important to measure the  useful thing/valuable supply use (wasting very little while working or producing something), and that 
 the parametric way(s) of doing things provides not enough information for policy analysis (Kalirajan, 1984; Kalirajan and Shand, 1986). The research reported here supports the importance of studying the individual farm 
 (wasting very little while working or producing something), and it is the first study of its kind to have 
 used the non-parametric method of Data Envelopment 
 Analysis (DEA) for analysing the (wasting very little while working or producing something) of individual farms in Pakistan. 
 The paper begins with a brief introduction of (wasting very little while working or producing something) measurement and of the development of DEA. 
 The description of data sources happens before the explanation of the DEA model in general and the (detailed description of exactly what is required)

 of this model for cotton production. Next, the use of a 
 Cobb-Douglas type of production function for identifying the important inputs in the production process is 
 discussed before presenting the results of the technical and allocative (wasting very little while working or producing something) analyses. Finally, the usefulness of the DEA model for examining the useful thing/valuable supply 
 use inefficiency of cotton production in Pakistan is 
 tested. 
 
 2. Measurement of (wasting very little while working or producing something) 
 The (wasting very little while working or producing something) of production units is measured either by parametric or by non-parametric methods. The 
 first approach guesses the limits/guidelines of the production or cost functions (related to numbers). The second one, 
 in contrast, builds a linear piece-wise function from 
 scientific (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) of inputs and outputs, without assuming any good  functional relationship between the inputs and the outputs. The non-parametric 
 or 'frontier' method of measuring (wasting very little while working or producing something) was first 
 introduced by Farrell (1957) and since then a few 
 improvements and extensions have happened (see 
 Battese (1992) and Coelli (1995)). 
 Building on Farrell's work, Charnes et al. (1978) 
 have developed the fractional linear programming 
 method of DEA, which compares inefficient firms 
 with the 'best practice' ones within the same group. 
 It has been used widely for (wasting very little while working or producing something) studies for 
 both public and private organizations (see Seiford and 
 State of control (1990)). In the farming-based money flow/money-based studies books, however, only a few examples of the application 
 of DEA could be found (Haag et al., 1992; Shimizu, 
 1992; Cloutier and Rowely, 1993). 
 
 2.1. DEA 
 The DEA way of doing things has come to be named after 
 its originators and is referred to as the CCR model. 
 It involves improving a scoring function defined as 
 the ratio of weighted sum of outputs of a particular 
 production unit and the weighted sum of its inputs, 
 that is (wasting very little while working or producing something). This function is improved subject 
 to the condition that with any of the production units 
 included in the analysis, the value of the goal 
 function (accomplished or gained) cannot be more than I, suggesting 
 that the (producing a lot with very little waste) units will have a score of 1. 
 
 The DEA method is thought of as one ofthe most successful ways of doing things of analysis proposed by (people who work to find information) 
 in Management Science and Operations Research, as 
 is obvious by the wastefulness of its applications (see 
 Coelli (1995)). However, the original version of the 
 CCR model is not very convenient for a linear programme as it has more handcuffs, etc. than (numbers that change/things that change), making it hard to solve. Because of this, the 'dual' version of the 
 CCR model is more popular as the DEA model. The 
 technical details can be found in Charnes et al. (1978), 
 Norman and Stoker (1991), Charnes et al. (1995), and 
 Coelli et al. (1998). 
 
 3. The sample of cotton producers 
 The data were collected from a randomly drawn 
 sample consisting of 120 farms from the cotton-wheat 
 area of the southern part of Pakistan's Punjab. The 
 sample farms can be treated as a (a mixture of things that are all pretty much the same) group 
 for a few reasons. First, all of the farms are in an 
 area where technical and (related to scientific farming) practice recommendation domains are the same. Second, they are in 
 reasonable closeness to each other. Third, all of them 
 face uniform natural and market conditions and the 
 same (set of machines). Finally, all the farms have broadly 
 almost the same  types of soils. 
 
 3.1. (features/ qualities/ traits) of farmers and farms 
 Information such as the farm operator's age, his 
 educational accomplishment, the size of the farm family and 
 the number of family members involved in farming is 
 given in Table 1. Most of the farmers are over 25 years 
 old, with the age ranging from 20 to 60 years. The 
 family size is large and three-fourths of the farms had 
 more than nine members per household, and on nearly 
 half of the farms, at least two of the family members 
 were working as full time farm workers on farm. 
 Most of the farmers till their own land, but quite a 
 few rent added/more area to increase the operational size 
 of their holdings. The holdings are divided into three 
 categories: farms which are less than 5 ha, 5-10 ha and 
 greater than 10ha. All the sample farms have almost the same 
 types of soils that are ideal for growing cotton. Cotton 
 occupies 77-85% of the area on different farms and 
 this proportion is even higher on large farms. Small 
 farmers in the area keep milk animals needing/ordering land

 4. The DEA model for cotton production 
 The model developed to study the (wasting very little while working or producing something) of cotton production is the input minimization version (dual)

 (4) 
 where}= 1, ... , 117 is the number of farms or Decision 
 Making Units (DMUs) in the sample, m=1 represents 
 cotton in the cotton-wheat system, i= 1, ... , 6 is the 
 number of inputs included in the analysis, Z0 is the 
 relative (wasting very little while working or producing something) score of the DMU, 'o', under study, 
 A j are lambda values that are the weights to be used 
 as multipliers for the input levels of a referent farm to 
 point to/show the input levels that an inefficient farm should 
 aim at to (accomplish or gain with effort) (wasting very little while working or producing something), Xij is the level of use for 
 the ith input on the jth farm, Ymj is the level of the mth 
 output on the jth farm, Your  is the level of the output on 
 unit 'o', and X0 is the vector of the levels of inputs 
 being used by the DMU 'o'. 
 The highest value of Z0 (:::;1) for the unit 'o' is 
 found by 'combining' the performance of all units being carefully studied. This is done in such a way that, for each 
 input, the combination of inputs does not go beyond the 
 inputs of unit 'o' and for each output and the combination of outputs is at least as great as that of unit 'o'. 
 On solving the model separately for each DMU in the 
 sample, the (wasting very little while working or producing something) scores ( &amp;lt; 1 for the inefficient 
 units and 1 for the (producing a lot with very little waste) ones) are established. A 
 score less than 1 means that a linear combination of 
 other units from the sample could produce the same 
 vector of outputs using lower levels of inputs. The 
 problem of returns to scale can be dealt with by using 
 the Banker et al. (1984) extension to the CCR model 
 as: (a) for constant returns to scale (CRS), the condition I; Ai 2: 1 is added; and (b) for (number or thing that changes) returns 
 to scale (VRS), the self-control/control device I; Ai = 1 is (forced (on people)/caused an inconvenient situation). 
 To get the (wasting very little while working or producing something) scores, a linear programming matrix was built which included input 
 and output data for each of the farms in the sample. 
 It was then used to test the (wasting very little while working or producing something) of an individual farm by substituting its inputs and outputs 
 into the vectors Y0 and X0 in Eqs. (2) and (3) above. 
 
 M. Shafiq, T. Rehman/Agricultural Money flow 22 (2000) 321-330 
 
 324 
 
 This 'iteration' or substitution was repeated 117 times 
 (three (something that's not part of the main group) farms were dropped from further analysis) to get (wasting very little while working or producing something) scores for all the sample farms. 
 For a firm to be (producing a lot with very little waste), two conditions must hold: 
 (a) that the calculated value of Z0 that is Z" must equal 
 1; and (b) all the slack (numbers that change/things that change) in the LP solution 
 must be 0 (Charnes et al., 1978). 
 
 5. Role of different inputs in crop working well 
 It is quite usual to (combine different things together so they work as one unit) some form of functional 
 analysis with the DEA model, mostly moving backward models, to identify those inputs that play a well-known/obvious role 
 in deciding/figuring out working well. (after that), the relative (wasting very little while working or producing something) of a production unit can be measured 
 (Charnes et al., 1978; Bowlin et al., 1985; Dyson 
 et al., 1990; Roll and Cook, 1993; Thanassoulis, 1993). 
 So, a Cobb-Douglas type of production function 
 was fitted to the data collected from the survey and 
 the results are discussed below. 
 
 5.1. Explanation of the (numbers that change/things that change) 
 The major inputs that are assumed to decide/figure out 
 the cotton crop output (kg/ha) include crop-watering/rinsing with water water (number per hectare), nitrogen (kg (vitamins, minerals, protein, etc.)/ha), 
 phosphate (kg (vitamins, minerals, protein, etc.)/ha), labour (h/ha), bug-killer 
 costs (Rs. per hectare) and tractor hours needed/demanded per 
 hectare for levelling, ploughing, planking and planting. The basic statistics related to these (numbers that change/things that change) are 
 presented in Table 2. It is clear that there is a wide difference/different version in both the input use and the cotton output. The 
 
 output received/got by some of the farmers in the sample 
 was three times as high as that (accomplished or gained) by others; 
 and there were wide differences/different versions in the levels at which 
 inputs were being used. There were large differences 
 in the use of nitrogenous (material that makes plants grow better) as some farmers 
 were using six times more (material that makes plants grow better) as compared to 
 others and some farmers did not use any phosphatic 
 (material that makes plants grow better). In preparing their fields for cotton planting, 
 some farmers use as few ploughings as two, while 
 some plough the fields 13 times before planting. Such 
 a difference/different version in the levels of inputs being used suggests 
 that possibly these levels represent a (running a business or organization very badly) 
 of useful thing/valuable supply use. 
 
 6. Results of the (related to numbers) guessed function 
 In Table 3, a very low value of the (changed to make better/changed to fit new conditions) R 2 
 (0.044) shows that the production function does not 
 explain a great deal of the relationship between the dependent and the (things that you control (like study times), that cause other things to change (like test scores)) as most of the 
 (numbers that change/things that change) had a non-significant effect on the increase 
 in cotton output. (numbers that change/things that change) like phosphatic (material that makes plants grow better) 
 use, labour and tractor hours used show negative 
 returns, suggesting an too much/too many use of these inputs. 
 So, the levels at which these inputs are being used 
 could be lowered without reduction in output levels. 
 These results in effect confirm the need for undertaking the analysis of the (wasting very little while working or producing something) of production using 
 a non-parametric method like DEA, as identifying 
 inefficient farms would suggest discovering the extent 
 by which their input use could be improved. What's more, when there is as much difference/different version in inputs used

 and the output produced as shown in Table 2, the 
 (wasting very little while working or producing something) analysis of individual farms assumes much 
 greater relevance. 
 
 The use of the basic DEA model started with the 
 single input-single output situation. More inputs were 
 introduced into the analysis, one at a time, to test 
 the relative (wasting very little while working or producing something) of individual farms. This procedure also shows how the increase in the number of 
 inputs affects the (wasting very little while working or producing something) rating of individual farms. 
 As the basis for comparison among them is broadened, 
 the ranking of individual producers improves. In the 
 initial run, the single input is nitrogen. The second run 
 involved two inputs, nitrogen and bug-killer expense; and for the third run, many inputs as defined 
 for the cotton production function were used. In all the 
 runs, seed cotton is the output. The (wasting very little while working or producing something) scores 
 of the individual farms were calculated separately for 
 both CRS and VRS ideas (you think are true). 
 The basic DEA model for the 'DMU-1' assuming 
 CRS is stated below:

 In the above equations, the subscript '120' refers to

 The nature of a DEA model is illustrated in Fig. I 
 for a single input-single output situation. Each point 
 represents a farm included in the (wasting very little while working or producing something) analysis. 
 The line OA is the (producing a lot with very little waste) edge of something/unexplored area assuming CRS, 
 as for each farm on that edge of something/unexplored area, there is no other 
 farm with a better input/output (changing from one form, state, or state of mind to another) ratio and 
 there is only one farm (54) on the (producing a lot with very little waste) edge of something/unexplored area. All 
 other farms are inefficient, as they use greater amounts

 of (material that makes plants grow better) to reach their current levels of output 
 when compared to farm 54. Given a high difference/different version in 
 nitrogen use, the important question is, do higher levels 
 of nitrogen computer program add/give to an increase in the 
 crop produce? The results show that this is not the case, 
 suggesting that an too much/too many use of nitrogen on these 
 farms takes them below the (producing a lot with very little waste) edge of something/unexplored area. 
 The points showed in Fig. 1 are scattered, and 
 therefore, the CRS idea (you think is true) would seem not to apply. Assuming that VRS do exist and as this idea (you think is true) is not so demanding, more farms are likely to be 
 located on the (producing a lot with very little waste) edge of something/unexplored area. There are four farms 
 (DMUs 2, 54, 28 and 33) with (wasting very little while working or producing something) scores of 
 1 lying on the edge of something/unexplored area, and they form the envelope 
 DCBE representing the edge of something/unexplored area to be used as referent 
 for other farms. The use of nitrogen on the (producing a lot with very little waste) 
 farms shows that the output increases with increase in 
 the level of input use. 
 The inefficient farms in the sample were using inputs at levels greater than needed/demanded relative to the out- 
 
 put levels being received by other farms in the sample. A summary of the (wasting very little while working or producing something) scores for all farms 
 is presented in Table 4. It is interesting to note that, 
 when VRS are assumed, only one farm has an (wasting very little while working or producing something) score of less than 60%. Whereas, when CRS

 are assumed, 38% of the farms have (wasting very little while working or producing something) scores 
 of less than 60%. 
 7.1. Use of DEA results to study inefficiency on an 
 individual farm 
 
 By using the results of the DEA model, it is possible to work out what is needed/demanded by inefficient farms 
 to become (producing a lot with very little waste). Take the farm DMU-70, with (wasting very little while working or producing something) scores of 57.97 and 58.78 under the CRS 
 and VRS ideas (you think are true), (match up each pair of items in order). For this farm, the 
 farms 40 (0.287), 54 (0.309) and 86 (0.382) are its referent units when CRS are assumed, while the DMUs 
 6 (0.043), 40 (0.246), 54 (0.316) and 86 (0.395) are 
 the referents when VRS are assumed. 
 The production practices of the DMU-70 and its referents are compared in Table 5, and clearly, the use of 
 inputs by the DMU-70 is 'excessive'. The 'excessive' 
 nature of the input use by DMU-70 is carried out when 
 the recommendations by the Central Cotton Research 
 Institute (CCRI, 1994) are carefully thought about/believed. According to 
 CCRI in this area, nitrogen plays the most in control/most common role in 
 deciding/figuring out cotton produce and phosphorus adds/gives 
 little, and to get best yield, there is no need to 
 plough the land more than four or five times. As is 
 obvious, this farm is not following the recommended 
 practices. However, this particular farm has a greater 
 number of land parcels (three) as compared to its 
 peers (DMUs 6, 46, 54, and 86) which are touching 
 
 327 
 
 farm holdings. This situation may have endangered 
 the chances of this farm becoming (producing a lot with very little waste). 
 The above comparison would suggest plans for 
 the DMU-70 to (give reasons for something) the use of its inputs. The 
 lambda values received/got from the DEA solution for this farm provide a (made up of different things) DMU which would produce 
 the equal level of output, but by using lesser levels of inputs as shown in Table 5. This information as 
 created by the DEA modelling approach is naturally interesting and the DEA model can be run to 
 examine allocative or money-based (wasting very little while working or producing something) of useful thing/valuable supply 
 use on individual farms, as illustrated in Section 8. 
 
 8. Results of allocative (wasting very little while working or producing something) analysis 
 The (understanding/ explanation) of allocative (wasting very little while working or producing something) depends 
 on the ideas (you think are true) made about a farmer's behaviour. 
 Farrell (1957) assumed that cost minimization is the 
 basis on which a farmer's portion decision is taken 
 to get a given level of output and the allocative inefficiency is a farmer's inability to equate the ratio of 
 not important products of inputs to the ratio of their (pertaining to each person or thing) prices. Lau and Yotopoulos (1971), Schmidt 
 and Lovell (1979), and Kopp and Diewert (1982) have 
 assumed (money made/good thing received) making the most of behaviour and have defined allocative inefficiency as the failure to equate the 
 not important value product of inputs to their prices. In the 
 DEA model, however, the behavioural idea (you think is true) is

 Results of the guess of both technical and 
 allocative (wasting very little while working or producing something) show that technically (producing a lot with very little waste) 
 farms were also allocatively (producing a lot with very little waste). However, some 
 units such as the DMU-101 and the DMU-111 were 
 technically (producing a lot with very little waste) but were not so allocatively. 
 
 8.1. Sensitivity analysis for an individual DMU's 
 allocative (wasting very little while working or producing something) 
 
 more hard to notice/skillful as the allocative (wasting very little while working or producing something) is the proportion by which the costs of the levels of inputs on a 
 farm can be reduced without any loss in output. So, 
 an (wasting very little while working or producing something) score of 0.8 hints that the DMU concerned could reduce its costs by 20% by choosing a 
 more cost-(producing a lot with very little waste) input mix. 
 In measuring allocative (wasting very little while working or producing something) of cotton production, the costs of individual inputs used have been guessed by using the actual prices paid by farmers. The 
 (numbers that change/things that change) belonging to the same category were combined 
 together to reduce the number of cost (numbers that change/things that change) in order to help analysis. The (numbers that change/things that change) defined were 
 expense (in Rs. per hectare) on (i) land (producing crops/helping something grow); (ii) cotton seed; (iii) thinning; (iv) inter-cultural 
 operations; (v) (material that makes plants grow better); (vi) crop-watering/rinsing with water; and (vii) bug-killer usage. The results as given in Table 6 show that, 
 assuming VRS, nearly 30% of the DMUs have an (wasting very little while working or producing something) score of 1. 
 
 The DMU-83 has the lowest allocative (wasting very little while working or producing something) 
 score of 56.67 (assuming VRS) and it can be used to 
 illustrate the use of sensitivity analysis for exploring 
 the avenues for improving the allocative (wasting very little while working or producing something). 
 The lambda values connected with the solution for 
 this farm show that the DMUs 30, 47, 54, 64, 84, 86 
 and 113 were its referent units (see Table 7). For most 
 of the inputs, the referent DMUs were spending much less than the DMU-83 especially on pest 
 control, (material that makes plants grow better), and (producing crops/helping something grow). Using lambda values of the referent DMUs, the targets which DMU-83 
 can aim at become allocatively (producing a lot with very little waste) and are presented in the last column of Table 7. This farm needs 
 to decrease its expense on bug-killer, crop-watering/rinsing with water and 
 land preparation operations. 
 
 9. Ending/deciding statements

 of a significant extent of useful thing/valuable supply use inefficiency on 
 cotton farms in the cotton-wheat production system 
 of Pakistan's Punjab. In many events, the quanti-

 ties of inputs used were (without a good reason) higher than what 
 would be needed/demanded to reach their present levels of 
 crop output. By using the DEA modelling approach 
 for (wasting very little while working or producing something) analysis, it is possible to (accomplish or gain with effort) two 
 types of results. First, it is possible to identify the changes/recalculations that can be made in the use of inputs on 
 inefficient farms by comparing them with their 'peer' 
 farms. Second, the factors that can be moved around/misled and tricked to 
 (make small) the too much/too many use of inputs and because of this reduce 
 the costs of production can be established. However, 
 for a meaningful (understanding/ explanation) of the DEA results, it 
 is necessary to think about  (all of/every part of) recommendation domains for different production practices in particular areas, as without including all the (connected/related) 
 and important factors in the analysis, one cannot be 
 bold about the sources of inefficiencies. Anyway, the DEA approach has an undoubted edge over 
 the standard production function analysis for identifying the sources of inefficiencies on individual farms. 
 The DEA results are much easier to understand/explain and to 
 use for (asking lots of questions about/trying to find the truth about) avenues for improvements in 
 technology and useful thing/valuable supply use (wasting very little while working or producing something) on farms. 
 This exercise in using the DEA modelling approach 
 for measuring (wasting very little while working or producing something) has (showed/shown or proved) that there 
 was a high degree of allocative inefficiency, regarding 
 costs of production, on cotton-producing farms in Pakistan. However, the (wasting very little while working or producing something) scores for both technical 
 and allocative (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) increase with increase in the 
 number of input (numbers that change/things that change) included in the DEA model. 
 The real advantage of DEA modelling is that it allows 
 the (detailed description of exactly what is required) of a multi-product, multi-input firm 
 (Byrnes et al., 1987). The construction of the 'efficient 
 edge of something/unexplored area' for measuring the (wasting very little while working or producing something) is (accomplished or gained) without having to make any pre-assumption (related to/looking at/thinking about) the 
 hidden (under) functional form and the (related to studying numbers) errors 
 connected with the (detailed description of exactly what is required) of such a function are 
 also avoided.
