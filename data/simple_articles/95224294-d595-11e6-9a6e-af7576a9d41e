 ABSTRACT 
 Peterson, E.W.F., Lan Jin and Ito, S., 1991. An econometric analysis of rice consumption in 
 the People's Republic of China. Agric. Econ., 6: 67-78. 
 Rice is the most important staple food in the People's Republic of China (PRC). In many 
 Asian countries rice appears to have become an inferior good, with income increases 
 leading to declines in per-person use as other food products are substituted for 
 rice. In this study, human rice consumption is carefully studied with a model that allows income 
 elasticities to change/differ  with income levels. An added equation accounting for rice disappearance as seed, animals feed, industrial uses and exports is also guessed. The results of the analysis point to/show that rice has become an inferior good in China and per-person use 
 is likely to (lower in number/get worse) in the future. Population growth and the growing use of rice for other 
 purposes means that total rice disappearance will continue to increase although at a rate 
 that is slower than has (in the past) been the case. The (described the future) changes in rice consumption 
 will create pressures to (change to make better/change to fit new conditions) production and trade patterns for rice as well as other 
 farming-based products. 
 
 INTRODUCTION 
 
 Almost 80% of the rice produced and ate/destroyed in the world is accounted for by six Asian nations, including the People's Republic of China 
 (PRC), India, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Vietnam and Japan (Ito, 1988). Of 
 these countries, the PRC is by far the largest producer and person of 
 rice. From 1986 to 1989, average once-a-year rice production in the PRC was 
 about 120 MMT * (throughout this paper, figures referred to/given a traffic ticket for rice consumption 
 or production are on a milled basis) compared with about 63 MMT for the

 same period in India, the second largest producer (USDA, 1990). Most of 
 the rice produced in the PRC is ate/destroyed by families as a staple food. 
 Over the last few years, the use of rice for animals feed has increased. In 1986, 
 rice fed to animals made up about 17% of total disappearance compared 
 with about 13% in the mid 1960's. Human consumption accounts for about 
 79% of total disappearance with the rest made up of seed, and 
 exports (USDA, 1986). 
 Recent information on the international rice market is presented in 
 Table 1. The figures for production, exports and imports are averages for 
 the 4-year period 1986 to 1989. The figures in the table illustrate two 
 striking features of the world rice market. First, only about 4% of total rice 
 production is traded compared with over 18% of total wheat production 
 and almost 13% of maize production. Four countries (PRC, Thailand, 
 Pakistan and the U.S.) account for more than two-thirds of total rice trade 
 and in three (Thailand, Pakistan and the U.S.), a large share (31.3% to 
 56.8%) of national production is exported. The second feature shown by 
 the figures in Table 1 is the importance of the PRC in world rice 
 production. Because exports account for less than one percent of production and the PRC holds almost no stocks, internal rice use is 
 
 RICE CONSUMPTION IN CHINA 
 
 69 
 
 about equal to production with both amounting to about 37% of 
 the similar world totals. Clearly, (compared to other things) small changes in production or consumption in the PRC could have an important effect on the 
 world market. For example, a 1% fall in internal use joined with a 
 1% increase in production could add more than 2 MMT of rice (more than 
 15% of current exports) to the present level of Chinese exports. A change 
 that's this big and important would have important results for producers in 
 such exporting nations as Thailand or the United States. 
 The purpose of this study is to examine the likely (change over time) of rice 
 consumption in the PRC. Total rice disappearance can be divided into 
 human consumption and consumption for other purposes including animals feed, seed, industrial uses and exports. Although human rice consumption accounts for most of the total disappearance, the amount of rice 
 ate/destroyed for other purposes is big and has been growing in recent 
 years. As a result, it is necessary to account for both of these elements in 
 testing the likely (change over time) of rice consumption in the PRC. In the next 
 section, models of per person human rice consumption and consumption of 
 rice for other purposes are described and guessed. These models are 
 then used to project Chin&#126;se rice consumption to the year 2000. In the 
 ending/deciding section, the results of the analysis and their effects/results/suggestions for 
 world trade in rice are summarized. 
 RICE CONSUMPTION IN THE PRC 
 
 In a study of rice consumption in 14 Asian countries, Ito et al. (1989) 
 found that income elasticities of demand have declined over the last few years in 
 many of these countries and, in a few, have become negative. Their 
 results for the PRC point to/show that rice is still a (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) good although the 
 income ability to stretch of demand appears to have declined over the last few years. 
 Other analysts have pointed to seen/obvious changes in Chinese food consumption patterns (Sicular, 1985; Crook, 1987; Tuan, 1987). As in most Asian 
 countries, rice consumption in the PRC is quite high compared with other 
 areas of the world, and it is likely that most Chinese families will 
 set apart any added/more income earned to foods other than rice, famously 
 meat and dairy products. 
 If the income ability to stretch of demand for rice in the PRC has become 
 negative, it is likely that per person rice consumption will (lower in number/get worse) in the 
 future as incomes continue to grow. China has experienced fast money-based 
 growth since money-based changes were started in the late 1970's. The World 
 Bank has projected average once-a-year growth in per person income of between 
 3.5% and 5.5% over the next 10-15 years (World Bank, 1985). Increases of 
 this nature joined with negative income elasticities mean significant 
 
 70 
 
 E.W.F. PETERSON ET AL. 
 
 declines in per person rice consumption. Whether these declines lead to 
 large exportable (more than what's needed) of rice depends on the way in which rice 
 production and total population change. If population growth is high 
 enough, the fall in per-person use may be offset and total rice 
 consumption may actually increase. Also, changes/recalculations in production 
 or increased use of rice as animals feed could reduce the amounts 
 available for export. 
 To account for these different influences on rice disappearance, it is 
 useful to guess separate equations for human consumption and for rice 
 used for other purposes. Also, human rice consumption should be 
 guessed on a per person basis to allow an test of the possibly 
 disagreeing effects of population and income growth. Finally, on the basis of 
 previous results, it is important to model human demand in a manner that 
 allows the income elasticities to change/differ  with the level of income. The 
 log-inverse-log model used by Ito et al. (1989) is the right/the proper representation of the relationships to be carefully studied: 
 (1) 
 where X is per-person use, Y is real per person income, and a, b 
 and c are coefficients to be guessed. This can also be written as; 
 log X= a - by- 1 - c log Y 
 
 (2) 
 
 The first almost the same as X with respect to Y is (bjY 2 - cjY)X. This 
 derivative is positive if b jY is larger than c and negative if b jY is smaller 
 than c.The income ability to stretch of demand came/coming from equations (1) or (2) 
 is: 
 N=bjY-c 
 As needed/demanded for this study, this income ability to stretch differs/changes with the level of 
 income and becomes negative when incomes increase to the point whereÂ· 
 the expression b jY is less than c. Ito et al. (1989) used thin slice, 
 time-series analysis to guess income elasticities of demand for the PRC 
 and 13 other Asian countries. Their results pointed to/showed that the income 
 ability to stretch of demand in the PRC (lowered in number/got worse/gotten worse) from 0.42 in 1961 to 0.13 in 1984. 
 In this study, time-series data are used to carefully study the relationship and 
 different price (numbers that change/things that change) from the ones used by Ito et al. (1989) are 
 included. Also, human consumption is used as the dependent 
 (number or thing that changes) rather than total disappearance as in the study by Ito et al. (1989). 
 Aside from human consumption, the principal use of rice is for animals 
 feed. Over 90% of the meat ate/destroyed in the PRC is pork although (related to chickens, hens, turkeys, etc.) 
 and dairy production are also significant animals businesses/projects (World Bank, 
 1987). Industrial animals production based on scientifically compounded 
 
 71 
 
 RICE CONSUMPTION IN CHINA 
 
 feeds is fairly limited but large amounts of locally produced grains and 
 grain (things produced along with something else) are fed to barnyard animals in traditional farming/managing money 
 systems. Southern China, the main rice producing area, is also a leading 
 hog production area (World Bank, 1987). The amount of rice used for feed 
 is influenced by animals (groups of people/animals/things), famously those of hogs and (related to chickens, hens, turkeys, etc.), 
 and the strength of feeding. Another (number or thing that changes) that may influence the use of 
 rice as feed is the price of maize, the main substitute for rice in animals 
 portions. So, a measure of animals numbers and maize prices are 
 important explanatory (numbers that change/things that change) in accounting for the consumption of rice 
 for purposes other than direct human consumption. The model guessed 
 for this study also includes rice land because the amount of rice used 
 for seed depends on land and seed use is included in the dependent 
 (number or thing that changes). The final (detailed description of exactly what is required), this way, includes rice land, total consumption of pork and (related to chickens, hens, turkeys, etc.) as a substitute for animals numbers, and real maize 
 prices as explanatory (numbers that change/things that change). 
 Most of the data used in this study are from the (related to studying numbers) Yearbook of 
 China and cover the period 1960-1986. National income, defined in the 
 PRC as the value of production leaving out/keeping out the government part/area, the 
 Chinese general index of retail prices (1950 = 100) used to (lower/flatten from losing air) the 
 income and some of the price (numbers that change/things that change), retail pork prices, producer prices 
 for maize, rice land, and population are all taken from this source. In 
 the (not being there; not being present) of reliable data on retail wheat and rice prices, world prices as 
 reported by the IMP are used. Data on rice consumption are from USDA 
 (1986). The equation for per person human consumption also includes a 
 dummy (number or thing that changes) for the years 1978-1986 to test the guess that the 
 farming-based changes begun in 1978 have had an effect on rice consumption 
 patterns. The equation was guessed with ordinary least squares and is 
 shown below with the t-ratios in parentheses.

 (yuan), PM real price of pork (yuan), RWR ratio of world rice to world wheat 
 prices, and D is a dummy (number or thing that changes) for the reform years 1978-86. 
 The results reported in equation (3) show a strong relationship between 
 income and consumption. Both income coefficients are significant and of 
 the expected sign. The price of pork is also significant suggesting a 
 cross-price demand ability to stretch of 0.75. This result supports the argument 
 
 72 
 
 E.W.F. PETERSON ET AL. 
 
 that high quality food products such as meat are being substituted for rice. 
 The coefficient of the price ratio for grain is not very different from 
 zero. This is not surprising given the long/big government control of these 
 markets in China. (promised that something will definitely happen or that something will definitely work as described) portions of staple foods have (in the past) been 
 available to all people, and prices have been strictly controlled by the 
 government. It is interesting to note that the dummy (number or thing that changes) is very different from zero. This hints that there has been a change in 
 the relationships as a result of the money-based changes launched in 1978. In 
 general, the model (does as expected) very well in (describing the future) the historical level of 
 per person rice consumption as can be seen in Table 1. Overall, equation (3) 
 appears to be a reliable representation of the (things that decide other things) of per person 
 rice demand. 
 Equation (3) can be used to chart the (change over time) of income elasticities in 
 the PRC. These historical elasticities are shown in Table 2. The results 
 point to/show that income elasticities (lowered in number/got worse/gotten worse) throughout the 1960's and 1970's, 
 turning negative in the early 1980's. By 1986, the guessed ability to stretch had 
 fallen to - 0.15. 
 The equation accounting for other uses of rice was also guessed with 
 ordinary least squares:

 (1.72) (2.42)

 (6.89) 
 
 (1.13) 
 
 (4) 
 
 R 2 = 0.95 
 p = -0.395(1.97) 
 where ou is rice ate/destroyed as feed, seed, exports and industrial usages 
 (1000 metric tonnes); MU rice area (1000 hectares); RM pork and (related to chickens, hens, turkeys, etc.) 
 consumption (100 million jin *); and Pco real producer price for corn in 
 the PRC (yuanjjin *). Equation (4) has been corrected for first-order 
 autocorrelation (p = - 0.395). The signs of all coefficients are as expected 
 and very different from zero at the 5% level of confidence with the 
 exception of the coefficient for real corn prices. 
 A more fancy (or smart) model of the Chinese rice market would include 
 (happening together) equations for supply, demand and trade. The (compared to other things) simple model presented above can be reasonable by noting the nature of the 
 market. (in the past), the state has exercised almost complete control over 
 production, prices and distribution of rice (Ash, 1988). Although the 
 farming-based changes have allowed some private trade, government helping action is still widespread. Under these conditions, it is reasonable to model

 consumption separately from production, trade and stocks. Also, the 
 quality of the data available may be such that more complicated (detailed descriptions of exactly what is required) would add little to the explanatory power of the model. The two 
 equations guessed for this study (describe the future) the historical (change over time) of the 
 two (things that change (like test scores) because of other things that you control (like study times)) quite correctly (Table 2) and appear to represent 
 the relationships of interest (well enough for the purpose). In the next section they are 
 used to project rice disappearance to the year 2000. 
 PROJECTIONS OF CHINESE RICE CONSUMPTION 
 
 The first step in projecting human rice consumption in China is to 
 develop (statements about the future) of the likely (change over time) of real income. Real per person 
 income has grown at an average once-a-year rate of about 7% in the 1980's. 
 These high rates of growth are not likely to be sustained in the 1990's. 
 Fast money-based growth over the last few years has led to inflationary pressures 
 and the government is working to slow growth rates. For the purposes of

 this study, two income pictures/situations were adopted. Both reflect the expectation 
 that income growth rates will (lower in number/get worse). In the first, the current rate of 7% is 
 maintained into the early 1990's, after which it falls to 5.5% from 1992-96 
 and 4.5% from 1997-2000. The low growth picture/situation uses rates of 5.0%, 
 4.0% and 3.5% for the same periods. The two income levels and the 
 connected income elasticities of demand are shown for selected years in 
 Table 3. 
 Population is the other (number or thing that changes) affecting total human consumption. 
 Because the population of China is very large, small differences in growth 
 rates could lead to large differences in the total number of people. The 
 World Bank has projected population in China to the year 2000. Their 
 projections may underestimate population growth in China because people born in the baby boom of the 1960's are now entering the (related to the process of making children) years. Also, programs to control (away from cities) population growth have 
 not been very effective and the new income streams resulting from the 
 changes in farming-based policies make it easier for (away from cities) families to support 
 added/more children (Lan, 1989). For this study, two population growth 
 paths are assumed. The first allows population to grow at 2.0% per year 
 from 1987 to 1992 and at 1.8% from 1993 to 2000. This leads to a higher 
 (described the future) population in the year 2000 than that (described the future) by the World 
 Bank. The second population growth path is based on the idea (you think is true) that 
 population grows at 1.8% per year until 1992 with the once-a-year growth rate 
 falling to 1.5% after that. The two population projections are shown for 
 1990, 1995 and 2000 in Table 3. Both of them point to/show that the Chinese 
 population will go past 1.3 billion by the year 2000. 
 The income and population projections give rise to four possible combinations. Only two of these, low population growth joined with high 
 income growth and high population growth along with poor growth, 
 are reported in Table 4. The other combinations lead to results between 
 the extremes created by these two growth profiles (Lan, 1989). As shown

 in Table 4, (compared to other things) fast growth in real income leads to a fall of around 
 13% in once-a-year per person rice consumption from 91 kg in 1990 to just under 
 80 kg in 2000. (even though there is the existence of) the decline in per-person use, population 
 grows (good or well enough), even on the basis of the low population growth projection, to cause a small increase in total consumption over this period. 
 Projected total consumption in 2000, however, is only 1.9% higher than the 
 1990 level because of the lower population growth ideas (you think are true). If the 
 income growth ideas (you think are true) are kept/held but even lower population growth 
 rates are assumed, total consumption could even begin to (lower in number/get worse). For 
 example, if the average once-a-year population growth rate is 1.5% for the 
 whole period between 1988 and 2000, total population will just barely reach 
 1.3 billion in 2000 and total rice consumption (at 103.2 MMT) would be a 
 fraction lower than the (described the future) level for 1990. 
 For the other picture/situation, high population growth rates are combined with 
 poor growth. Once-a-year per person rice consumption falls less quickly to 
 about 85 kg in 2000 and the higher assumed population growth leads to an 
 increase in total human consumption between 1990 and 2000 of 9.6%. The 
 two pictures/situations shown in Table 4 can be taken to represent upper and lower 
 bounds for total human rice consumption in the PRC. Other ideas (you think are true) 
 about income and population growth would generally fall between these 
 two extremes. Based on these results it appears that total rice consumption 
 by the people will grow between 2% and 10% over the next 
 ten years. In contrast, if one assumes that the level of once-a-year per person rice 
 consumption in 2000 remains at the 1986 figure of 93 kg, total human 
 consumption would be between 124 and 128 MMT depending on the

 ideas (you think are true) on population growth compared with the range of 106-117 
 MMT projected for the year 2000 in this study. 
 To project the disappearance of rice for other uses, it is necessary to 
 (describe the future) values for the explanatory (numbers that change/things that change). The projections for rice 
 land and pork and (related to chickens, hens, turkeys, etc.) consumption are based on time (popular things/general ways things are going) while 
 the real price of corn was held constant at its average value between 1981 
 and 1985. The projected explanatory (numbers that change/things that change) are shown in Table 5 along 
 with projections of rice consumption for other purposes and total rice 
 disappearance. Total rice disappearance includes human consumption and 
 other uses of rice. In the low population growth/high income growth 
 picture/situation, total disappearance increases by 6.2% from an guessed volume 
 of 128.4 MMT in 1990 to 136.4 MMT in the year 2000. In the picture/situation 
 coupling high population growth with poor growth, total disappearance increases from 131.3 to 147.5 MMT, an increase of 12.3%. Again, using 
 the 1986 figure for per-person use (93 kg) would lead to much 
 higher (statements about the future) for total rice consumption, ranging from 155 to 159 MMT. 
 To understand the effects/results/suggestions of these results, it is helpful to think about 
 some independent projections of Chinese rice production. The World 
 Bank, for example, has (described the future) once-a-year increases of 1.8%. If these 
 increases are (understood/made real/achieved) over the coming ten years, total milled production 
 would reach about 155 MMT in the year 2000. On the basis of the results 
 presented in this study, this production guess hints an exportable

 extra ranging from 7 to 25 MMT. In another study, Noh (1983) (described the future)Â· 
 that milled production would reach 187.6 MMT by the year 2000. The 
 exportable extra would be even larger if this (statement about the future) is (understood/made real/achieved). Note 
 that (statements about the future) based on (compared to other things) constant levels of per-person use would seriously underestimate the potential excess supply. Using the 
 1986 figure for per-person use, the World Bank production projections and the levels of rice disappearance for other uses (described the future) in this 
 study, Chinese rice disappearance would be about equal to availability in 2000. This shows the importance of allowing income elasticities of 
 demand to change/differ  with the level of income. 
 CONCLUSION 
 
 The results set out above are not came/coming from a complete model with 
 endogenous production and government policy. As the (described the future) slowing in 
 the growth of total human rice consumption becomes seen/obvious, producers 
 and the Chinese government can be expected to react in some way to the 
 changes in consumption patterns. Policies designed to increase rice production may need to be changed because of these changes. As people 
 set apart greater proportions of their growing budgets to high quality 
 products such as meat and dairy products, demand for feed grains can be 
 expected to grow. Given the size of the world rice market (see Table 1), 
 plans based on trading growing excess supplies of rice for imported 
 feed grains do not appear promising. Any sustained increase in the level of 
 rice exports by the PRC is likely to depress world rice prices quite 
 (in a big way), worsening the PRC's terms of trade. A more promising 
 plan may be to put into use policies that encourage feed grain production at 
 the expense of further increases in rice production. (using other choices) some of 
 the current rice land could be moved/changed to rice varieties especially 
 good for feeding animals. Reactions of this nature are likely to result in 
 lower production levels than (described the future) by the World Bank and actual 
 exportable (more than what's needed) will probably be much less than the amounts 
 pointed to/showed in the previous section. 
 Other effects/results/suggestions of the changing consumption patterns in the PRC are 
 harder to detail. In a less controlled market, the slower growth in 
 demand would cause rice prices to (lower in number/get worse) relative to the price of other 
 products (that are bought and sold), benefiting poor people and providing the (rewards or reasons for doing something) to 
 re-set apart useful things/valuable supplies from rice production to feed grain and animals 
 production. In the PRC, the effects may be to encourage production of 
 animals products, vegetables and other foods for the small free market 
 started as part of the farming-based reform. Rice grown in the northern 
 parts of the PRC on land more suited to wheat (producing crops/helping something grow) may be replaced 
 
 78 
 
 E.W.F. PETERSON ET AL. 
 
 with that crop. So, the market for wheat, as well as those for feed grains 
 and animals products may be affected by the (described the future) changes. Much will 
 depend on the response of the government to these changes and the types 
 of price policies put into use. 
 Finally, slower growth in the demand for rice in the PRC will have an 
 hit/effect on world markets for rice, feed grains and, maybe, animals 
 products and wheat. The PRC could possibly become the leading rice 
 exporting country if falling consumption leads to increased exports. It could 
 also become an important market for feed grains if land is not moved/changed from 
 rice production to feed grain production. Because per-person use 
 of rice is likely to fall as incomes increase, the future growth in total rice 
 consumption is likely to be lower than what many planners had expected. 
 This (statement about the future) is especially important in a country where markets cannot 
 be expected to guide the portion of useful things/valuable supplies toward production of other 
 crops and animals products for which demand is likely to increase.
