 Abstract 
 A survey of two (away from cities) markets in southwest Nigeria over 14 months showed that supplies, sales and prices of sheep and goats varied 
 widely during the period with a sharp peak during the Muslim special celebration of Eid-e1-Kabir and a smaller peak during the Christmas-New Year 
 period. Local West African Dwarf (WAD) sheep and goats and northern Y' ankasa sheep and Red Sokoto goats were traded in the markets 
 and animals were (bought something for money) for rearing, trading, (formal, special events or series of actions), butchering/ catering, sacrifice, and special celebrations. There were a big differences 
 between species /breeds (bought something for money) for different purposes. A (related to feeling pleasure) price model was fitted to decide/figure out factors influencing price. After 
 changes/recalculations were made for age, weight, sex, time of transaction and market, WAD sheep commanded higher prices than WAD goats and 
 Red Sokoto goats for all purposes except for butchering/ catering; Red Sokoto goats commanded almost the same  or lower prices than WAD goats 
 depending on the purpose for (instance of buying something for money); and Y'ankasa sheep, mostly (bought something for money) for the Eid-el-Kabir special celebration, commanded (only a little bit) 
 higher prices than WAD sheep. The (your share of sales out of all sales) of WAD sheep is now small and is under competition from northern sheep and goats, 
 so increased production of WAD sheep in the south will benefit both producers and people in the area. In general, the results point to/show 
 that buyers have preferences for clearly stated/particular breeds and species for clearly stated/particular purposes, so producers and sellers may benefit by targeting specific 
 buyer categories and times of the year. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

 1. Background and goals 
 Trypanotolerant West African Dwarf (WAD) 
 sheep and goats are the most common (buffalo, deer, antelope, etc.) 
 species kept by small-scale crop farmers in the humid zone of west and central Africa. Of the 19.8 
 million small (buffaloes, deer, antelopes, etc.) in the zone, over 60% are 
 WAD goats (Mcintire et al., 1992). Nearly half of 
 the small (buffaloes, deer, antelopes, etc.) of humid zone are found in 
 Nigeria (Jahnke, 1982). As the group demand for 
 small (buffalo, deer, antelope, etc.) meat in the zone goes beyond supply 
 from local sources, the gap is met by supplies from 
 the subhumid and semiarid zones in the north of the 
 country and beyond. In the past, only southern city-based 
 markets used to be served by northern animals but in 
 the last few years, northern animals have started penetrat0169-5150/98/$17.00 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

 ing southern (away from cities) markets, and the share of northern 
 animals in the southern markets has been increasing. 
 Mostly, Red Sokoto goats and Y'ankasa sheep 
 are exported to the southern markets, and more goats 
 than sheep are exported (Francis, 1990; Jabbar, 1995). 
 Of all the animals traded in the southern (away from cities) 
 markets, only a few are (bought) by local villagers 
 for rearing, some are bought by traders to resell live 
 or as meat and most of the animals are bought by 
 different types of people for (formal, special events or series of actions) and 
 special celebrations, e.g., birth, marriage, funeral, sacrifice, 
 Christmas and Eid-el-Kabir (Sandford, 1982; Francis, 1990; Jabbar, 1995). It is common among Christians, Muslims and believers in spirits in the area to offer to 
 sacrifice an animal if a wish is satisfied, e.g., if a sick 
 person gets well. (usually/ in a common and regular way), the meat of the sacrifi- 
 
 22 
 
 M.A. Jabbar /Agricultural Money flow 18 (1997) 21-30 
 
 cial animal is distributed among poor neighbours. 
 Muslims also sacrifice animals on the occasion of 
 Eid-el-Kabir (also called Eid-el-Adha) special celebration to 
 remember predictor of the future Ibrahim's (predictor of the future Abraham 
 in Christian religion) response to god's wish to 
 sacrifice his son to prove his commitment, love and 
 loyalty to god. Since Muslims follow Moon-related calendar, 
 this occasion moves forward by 10-11 days every 
 year. 
 Earlier market and price surveys in southern 
 Nigeria have generally shown that supplies, sales and 
 prices of small (buffaloes, deer, antelopes, etc.) peak at special celebration times and 
 that the price of a particular species /breed depends 
 on animal attributes such as weight, sex, time of 
 sale, location of market (Okali, 1979; Okali and 
 Upton, 1985; Francis and Ingawa, 1988; Francis, 
 1990; Jabbar, 1995). These studies have also shown 
 that (in name only/very small amount) prices of southern species /breeds were 
 lower than that for northern species /breeds but in 
 the (not being there; not being present) of appropriate changes/recalculations for animal 
 (features/ qualities/ traits) like age, weight and sex, the price 
 comparisons may not reflect true differences. More than that, these studies did not think about/believe the possibility of 
 any significant price differences between animals 
 (bought something for money) for different purposes. Andargachew and 
 Brokken (1993) have found significant price differences between small (buffaloes, deer, antelopes, etc.) (bought something for money) for different purposes in the Ethiopian markets. 
 The goals of this paper are to decide/figure out if 
 buyers of small (buffaloes, deer, antelopes, etc.) in southern Nigeria have 
 planned preferences for clearly stated/particular species /breeds 
 for clearly stated/particular purposes, and whether they pay very different prices for different species /breeds 
 agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with their preferences. Answers to these 
 questions have important effects/results/suggestions for the local 
 and northern producers who supply the southern 
 markets. Any significant price differences by 
 species /breeds, purpose and time of (instance of buying something for money) would 
 mean that producers and sellers could benefit by 
 targetting clearly stated/particular buyer categories and times of the 
 year to sell their animals. 
 
 2. Materials and methods 
 2.1. Source of data 
 Two (away from cities) markets-Oja and Apomu-were 
 watched/supervised in Oyo state, southwest Nigeria. Oja is 
 
 located about 10 km outside Oyo town, and Apomu, 
 about 35 km away from lbadan, a large city. These 
 markets are functionally independent in the sense 
 that their supply country and service areas are 
 mostly different. Both are general valuable thing markets, a section of which is used for trading small 
 (buffaloes, deer, antelopes, etc.). Both the markets (usually/ in a common and regular way) meet every 4 
 days, and more often before major special celebrations 
 such as Christmas and Eid-el-Kabir. Data were collected each market day from the buyers and the 
 sellers of all the animals traded except that during 
 special celebration periods when large number of animals were 
 traded, records of a random sample of animals were 
 taken. Data were collected for the period December 
 1989 to January 1991. During this period, the two 
 markets met for a total of 223 days and records were 
 collected of 4504 traded animals. 
 For each traded animal, data were collected on 
 price, species, breed, sex, age (months), live weight 
 (kg), seller type, seller sex, buyer type, buyer sex, 
 reason for sale, reason for (instance of buying something for money) or meant use 
 of the animal. Animals are not (usually/ in a common and regular way) weighed by 
 buyers and sellers in the market but an ability by 
 either side to make a good guess about weight helps 
 in making a good (deal with a good price/agreement between people). However, for the purposes 
 of this study, each traded animal was weighed on a 
 scale immediately after the buyer and the seller 
 reached an agreement to exchange. Age was measured by examining teeth and by talking to the seller 
 and the buyer. Some general (features/ qualities/ traits) of this 
 sample were reported earlier (Jabbar, 1995) and the 
 results of more difficult/strict/high quality price analysis are presented 
 in this paper. 
 2.2. (related to careful studying or deep thinking) method 
 
 A (related to feeling pleasure) price model was used to decide/figure out the 
 effects of different factors on price. A (related to feeling pleasure) price 
 function relates the price of a product (good or 
 service) to its different attributes or (features/ qualities/ traits). 
 Waugh (1928) and later Lancaster (1971) made early 
 tries to relate price to product (features/ qualities/ traits). 
 Rosen (1974) and Lucas (1975) advanced those ideas 
 providing a possible (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) for (related to feeling pleasure) price 
 analysis. The hidden (under) guess of such analysis 
 is that products have utility bearing attributes and 
 that the values of those attributes add/give to the 
 price of the product. The watched/followed product price is 
 
 M.A. Jabbar /Agricultural Money flow 18 (1997) 21-30 
 
 therefore a (thing made up of different things) of the understood values of the 
 product's attributes. 
 The explanation of (related to feeling pleasure) pricing offers no suggestion about the functional form controlling/ruling the 
 relationship between price and different attributes, 
 this is carefully thought about/believed a matter for scientific desire/decision (Williams, 1989). The possible (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) 
 suggested by Rosen (1974) assumes competitive 
 market structure where people' bid functions and 
 suppliers' offer price functions are always mostly unrelated 
 at the balance. So (related to feeling pleasure) price function is 
 mostly a function of product attributes and not of 
 individual buyer and seller attributes (Oczkowski, 
 1994). This means that only products are (made different), while their markets, buyers and sellers are not. 
 In most scientific studies, however, linear moving backward 
 models have been used with product as well as 
 market and market agent attributes as (numbers that change/things that change) suggesting the existence of elements of noncompetitiveness in the (connected/related) product market being (examined closely) (see for example, Brorsen et al., 1984; Francis, 
 1990; Parker, 1993; Parker and Zilberman, 1993; 
 Andargachew and Brokken, 1993; Williams et al., 
 1993; Oczkowski, 1994; Rodriguez et al., 1995). 
 Most (related to feeling pleasure) moving backward models use a set of 
 (numbers-based) (continuous) (numbers that change/things that change), a set of (not numbers-based) (separate) (numbers that change/things that change) in the form of dummies, and 
 sometimes a set of interaction (numbers that change/things that change). For 
 (numbers-based) (numbers that change/things that change) in the moving backward, the (pertaining to each person or thing) partial almost the same as the function represents the 
 understood not important attribute price. For (not numbers-based) (numbers that change/things that change), the guessed coefficient measures the hit/effect 
 of the presence of the given attribute. In this case, 
 the understood ((described the future)) price cannot be came/coming from 
 a partial derivative but needs/demands added/more moving around/misleading and tricking (Gujarati, 1988). In models with many (not numbers-based) attributes each with a few categories needing/ordering 
 many dummy (numbers that change/things that change) and many interaction 
 terms, the number of terms in the equation may 
 . become large. In such cases, the guess of the 
 (described the future) prices becomes awkward and at times 
 hard to understand/explain and compare (see for example, 
 Francis, 1990; Andargachew and Brokken, 1993; 
 Rodriguez et al., 1995). 
 An other choice is to use Analysis of Covariance 
 (AnCov) way of doing things which is a combination of linear 
 moving backward and analysis of variance (ANOVA). In the 
 AnCov way of doing things, the ANOVA results are (changed to make better/changed to fit new conditions) 
 
 23 
 
 for the linear relationships between the dependent 
 (number or thing that changes) and the covariates (Norusis, 1993). The 
 general clear form of the AnCov model may be 
 written as: P = F(Q,C) + U, where P is the watched/followed price of a product, Q is a set of factors 
 ((not numbers-based) (numbers that change/things that change)) each with more than one categories, C is a set of covariates ((numbers-based) (numbers that change/things that change)), and U is a leftover/extra error term. (connected/related) 
 interaction terms may be optionally included in the 
 model. The guessed limits/guidelines of the model can 
 be used to guess the (changed to make better/changed to fit new conditions) mean prices of 
 different categories of a product, e.g., male and 
 female sheep: (changed to make better/changed to fit new conditions) prices are guessed prices if 
 both male and female were of the same attributes. In 
 a multifactor, multicovariate model, the limits/guidelines 
 for categories of a factor are guessed by (changing to make better/changing to fit new conditions) 
 the effects of all other factors and the covariates. 
 With (happening together) or combined confidence periods of time (or space) created by the model, the importance of differences 
 of the limits/guidelines of different categories of a factor 
 can be compared (Norusis, 1993; Gujarati, 1988). In 
 way of thinking/basic truth/rule, linear moving backward and AnCov ways of doing things 
 perform the same function but (a) little differently. 
 The principal advantage of AnCov results is that 
 they can be understood/explained more directly and easily to 
 compare differences between categories of a factor. 
 In this study, the AnCov way of doing things was employed 
 using the General Factorial Analysis of Variance 
 procedure of SPSS for Windows to guess limits/guidelines (Norusis, 1993). The factors and covariates used 
 are discussed in Section 3.2. 
 
 3. Results 
 3.1. General (features/ qualities/ traits) of the data 
 Of the 4504 animals traded in the two markets, 
 69% were WAD goats, 9% WAD sheep, 21% Red 
 Sokoto goats and 1% were Y' ankasa sheep (Table 
 1). There were a small number of Red Kano goats 
 and Balarni sheep from the north which were (match up each pair of items in order) combined with Red Sokoto goats and Y'ankasa 
 sheep in this analysis. Of all the animals, 76% were 
 sold by farmers from the surrounding areas of the 
 two markets, and 26% by traders. Of all the traded 
 animals, 24% were (bought something for money) by farmers for rearing, 
 27% by traders for resale in the same or other (away from cities)

 Traders are an important category of market agents 
 who are more experienced and skilled than any other 
 type of buyer or seller in testing the product 
 quality attributes of each animal. They are also 
 skilled in testing the true value of an animal and 
 the value a particular type of buyer or seller may put 
 on the animal. These knowledge and skill mostly 
 influence the margin they can come from 
 each transaction. 
 Some traders in the sample markets bought local 
 animals from the farm gate or at the market for 
 resale in the market while other traders brought 
 northern animals from terminal city-based  markets in 
 Oyo and Ibadan. Some local traders maintained stalls 
 at the market where few animals were kept on 
 non-market days to meet the emergency needs of 
 local buyers. Transactions during non-market days 
 were not watched/supervised in this study. During a market 
 day, a buyer or a seller, especially a trader, could 
 be involved in multiple transactions-buying/selling 
 a few animals or buying and reselling the same 
 animal the same day. It was hard to keep track of 
 such many transactions. Since records of all individual transactions were kept, a trader involved in

 many transactions was recorded as a buyer in one 
 transaction and a seller in another. 
 There are a big differences between species 
 and breeds (bought something for money) for different purposes (Table 
 1). The sample markets being (away from cities) with supply 
 country for WAD sheep and goats, traders would 
 be (usually/ in a common and regular way) expected to sell but not (instance of buying something for money) 
 Y' ankasa sheep and Red Sokoto goats of the north, 
 and this was in fact the case. Ninety percent of the 
 Y' ankasa sheep were (bought something for money) by people for 
 the Christmas and Eid-el-Kabir special celebrations for which 
 Red Sokoto goat was also preferred to WAD sheep 
 and goats. WAD goat was the favourite animal for 
 sacrifice, butchering and catering but Red Sokoto 
 goat was the most important animal used for (formal, special events or series of actions) such as funerals, births and marriages. 
 A large number of animals are traded around the 
 times of special celebrations. Supplies and sales of animals 
 peaked in June-July happening with the Muslim 
 special celebration of Eid-el-Kabir. A smaller peak in December 
 (happened at the same time with the Christmas-New Year special celebrations. 
 Supplies built up over the few weeks before Eidel-Kabir in July. Actual supplies in June-July 1990 
 accounted for 55% of total supply for the year with 
 July alone accounting for 43% of the total supply for 
 the year. Out of the total July supply, 73% were on 
 offer on three market days within 10 days before 
 Eid-el-Kabir. During the whole 14 months period 
 
 25 
 
 M.A. Jabbar /Agricultural Money flow 18 ( 1997) 21-30 
 
 supply per market per day averaged 74 animals but 
 supply averaged 117 and 47 animals (match up each pair of items in order) 
 during peak special celebration periods (June-July, DecemberJanuary) and other (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) months. Northern animals 
 made up/was equal to 40-50% of daily supplies during the 
 peak special celebration periods and 20-28% of the daily supplies during other months. This points to/shows that northern suppliers mostly target special celebration related markets 
 in the south. 
 Watched/followed age and live weight of the traded animals are shown in Table 2. Overall, Y' ankasa sheep 
 were the oldest and heaviest animals while WAD 
 goats were the lightest. Females were older and 
 heavier than males. Among different end uses, animals bought for rearing and sacrifice were younger 
 and lighter than those bought for trading, (formal, special events or series of actions), special celebrations and butchering/catering. Buying 
 younger and lighter animals for rearing would be 
 expected but buying younger and lighter animals for 
 
 sacrifice points to/shows that when happiness-causing god in the 
 spirit of sacrifice, size of the animal is maybe not 
 important. Animals traded during June-July were of 
 higher average weight than those traded during other 
 months. This was mostly because heavier northern 
 animals were traded in June-July for the Muslim 
 special celebration of Eid-el-Kabir. It may be noted that Eid-elKabir happens 10-11 days sooner every year due to 
 the Moon-related cycle, but whenever it happens, larger animals would be (usually/ in a common and regular way) (bought something for money). 
 3.2. (things that decide other things) of price 
 
 A few models were fitted to test the effects of 
 different factors on the price per animal. The results 
 of the best (singing, dancing, acting, etc., in front of people) models are presented in Table 
 3. In the overall model run with the whole sample, 
 age, age square, live weight and live weight square 
 were used as covariates while purpose of (instance of buying something for money),

 species /breed, sex, market and month of (instance of buying something for money) 
 were used as factors. In order to test whether differences in species/breed preferences for clearly stated/particular purposes were also reflected in price differences, interactions between purpose of buying and 
 species /breed, sex and market were introduced in 
 the overall model. But because certain 
 species/breeds were not (bought something for money) for some pur- 
 
 presents/asks/stands in a showy and fake way and sometimes very few were (bought), 
 a few cells in the data matrix were empty. In this 
 case, the model guessed the coefficients of the 
 interaction terms assuming those empty cells as null 
 or zero values but the guess being tested in this 
 way was not the guess of interest to this study

 empty cells). Therefore, rather than introducing interaction terms in the overall model, separate models 
 were fitted to animals (bought something for money) for clearly stated/particular purposes, using (connected/related) factors and categories. 
 In the overall model, the specified covariates and 
 factors explain 77% of the difference/different version in price per 
 animal but in the purpose clearly stated/particular models, the explanatory power differs/changes from 68% for animals (bought something for money) for (formal, special events or series of actions) to 84% for animals (bought something for money) 
 for rearing (Table 3). Among the covariates, age and 
 live weight have significant relationship with price 
 but the high levels change/differ  in purpose clearly stated/particular models. 
 
 Except in the case of special celebration, the coefficient of live 
 weight is greater than that for age. For special celebration, age 
 is a more important (number or thing that changes) than weight (actually 
 the coefficient of weight is not (meaningful numbers)) because for the Muslim special celebration of Eid-el-Kabir, 
 animals below certain age are not good for murder. 
 The negative effect of age square, significant in 
 all cases except for rearing, trading and butchering, 
 point to/show that less higher cost is paid for older animals. 
 The average age of animals (bought something for money) for rearing is 
 low with a small range which maybe explains why 
 
 28 
 
 M.A. Jabbar /Agricultural Money flow 18 (1997) 21-30 
 
 the coefficient of age square of this group is not 
 significant. The sign of weight square is positive in 
 the overall model and for rearing, butchering and 
 special celebration, pointing to/showing that price increases at an increasing rate as animals get heavier, though this relationship is significant only in the case of special celebration, pointing to/showing higher higher cost is paid for heavier animals 
 murdered for special celebration. For trading, (formal, special events or series of actions) and 
 sacrifice, the negative sign of weight square points to/shows 
 that less higher cost is paid for heavier animals, especially those (bought) for trading and (formal, special events or series of actions). 
 Other things being equal, the results also show the 
 following. 
 (a) In the overall model, traders, butchers/ caterers 
 and people buying for (formal, special events or series of actions) paid much lower prices and those buying for special celebrations paid higher prices than prices paid by farmers 
 for rearing, which was used as the base category. 
 Traders and butchers I caterers paid (a) little lower 
 prices than that paid by people buying for 
 (formal, special events or series of actions). There was no a big difference between prices paid for animals (bought something for money) for rearing 
 and for sacrifice. 
 (b) In the overall model, WAD sheep and 
 Y' ankasa sheep prices were much higher and 
 Red Sokoto goat prices were much lower than 
 WAD goats. Prices of Y'ankasa sheep were much higher than those for WAD sheep. But the 
 pattern varied between purpose clearly stated/particular models. All 
 types of buyers paid much higher prices for 
 WAD sheep compared to WAD goats, except in the 
 case of butchers/caterers. There was no significant 
 difference between WAD goat and Red Sokoto goat 
 prices for animals (bought something for money) for rearing, trading and 
 special celebration but Red Sokoto goat prices were much lower in case of (instances of buying things for money) for (formal, special events or series of actions) and 
 butchering/ catering. Y' ankasa sheep prices were 
 much higher than those for WAD sheep in the 
 overall model as well as in the model for special celebration, for 
 which most Y' ankasa sheep were (bought). 
 (c) In the overall model, prices for females were 
 lower than for males, but the differences were not 
 significant. However, the pattern varied between purpose clearly stated/particular models. Females (bought something for money) for rearing, 
 trading and sacrifice were paid higher prices but 
 significant only in the case of rearing which is 
 agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with the breeding goals of the buyers. 
 Females (bought something for money) for butchering/ catering, cere- 
 
 monies and special celebrations were paid lower prices. The 
 difference was significant only in the case of (instances of buying things for money) for special celebration, because hopefully a male is 
 murdered for Eid-el-Kabir. 
 (d) In the overall model, prices in Apomu market 
 were much lower than in Oja. However, in 
 purpose clearly stated/particular models, prices in Apomu were 
 higher sometimes and lower in others but in no 
 case the difference was significant. 
 (e) The month of (instance of buying something for money) was grouped into 
 a few groups on the basis of test runs which showed 
 that prices were almost the same  during certain periods. In the 
 overall model, compared to December 1989-January 
 1990 period (which was carefully thought about/believed as the base), 
 February to May 1990 prices were significantly 
 lower, and August to November 1990 prices were 
 also much lower. June-July and December 
 1990-January 1991 prices were not significantly 
 different from the base period. In the purpose clearly stated/particular models, the signs, high levels and importance 
 of occasional price differences were highly variable 
 though the general pattern was the same as that for 
 the overall model except in the case of special celebration 
 (instances of buying things for money), which was time specific. In the case of 
 special celebration, April-May prices were much lower 
 than the previous December-January prices but 
 June-July prices were much higher. The reason is that the special celebration held in June-July period was 
 more important than that held in April-May. The 
 prices in next December-January were significantly 
 lower compared to previous December-January, the 
 base period. 
 
 4. Discussion and end/end result 
 In the southwest Nigerian (away from cities) markets supplies, 
 sales and prices of small (buffaloes, deer, antelopes, etc.) peak before the 
 Muslim special celebration of Eid-el-Kabir and a little bit 
 during the Christmas-New Year period. Throughout 
 the year, animals are (bought) for rearing, trading, 
 butchering/ catering, sacrifice and different (formal, special events or series of actions) such as marriage, funeral, birthdays, and for 
 special celebrations. There are strong preferences among buyers 
 for clearly stated/particular species and breeds of small (buffaloes, deer, antelopes, etc.) 
 for clearly stated/particular purposes as pointed to/showed by a big differences in the amount/quantity of (instances of buying things for money). Local WAD 
 goats and sheep are preferred for rearing because of 
 
 M.A. Jabbar /Agricultural Money flow 18 (1997) 21-30 
 
 their helpful change to the local (surrounding conditions), for 
 butchering/catering because of the local people' 
 taste and preference for the meat of local animals, 
 and for sacrifice which has long cultural tradition 
 attached to local animals. Local species /breeds were 
 also preferred for murdering on the occasion of 
 different (formal, special events or series of actions) when entertaining guests was the 
 first (or most important) goal, and for special celebrations. But the present 
 purchase pattern points to/shows that this preference pattern 
 is changing with more and more more northern 
 species/breeds used for these purposes. Northern 
 animals made up/was equal to 34% of supplies in the present 
 survey compared to 28% reported for a almost the same  survey managed and did/done during 1983-85 in which the same 
 markets were included (Francis, 1990). 
 Average supplies per market day including peak 
 period was 35 in 1983-1985 compared to 74 in the 
 1989-1991 survey. The (your share of sales out of all sales) of southern 
 animals in total supply and sales have remained 
 stable between the two survey periods. However, the 
 number of northern animals in the southern markets 
 in the (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) as well as peak market periods have 
 increased significantly over time. 
 One of the main reason for increased penetration of northern animals into the southern (away from cities) markets is that transportation of animals from the north 
 has become faster, easier and cheaper due to better 
 and wider roads that allow larger lorries to carry 
 many more animals per trip. Within the southern part 
 of the country, connection of (away from cities) markets to city-based 
 centers, such as lbadan with Apomu, has improved. 
 As a result, northern animals can be sold at more 
 competitive prices at (away from cities) markets. 
 (changed to make better/changed to fit new conditions) prices of WAD goats are either much higher or almost the same as  Red Sokoto goat prices 
 depending on the purpose for buying but (changed to make better/changed to fit new conditions) 
 prices of WAD sheep are much higher than 
 either goat breed for almost all purposes, pointing to/showing a 
 strong buyer preference for this breed. 
 (changed to make better/changed to fit new conditions) prices of Y' ankasa sheep, (bought something for money) 
 mostly for the Muslim special celebration of Eid-el-Kabir, is 
 higher than WAD sheep prices. However, the overall 
 (your share of sales out of all sales) of WAD sheep is only 9% compared to 
 70% for WAD goats and 21% for Red Sokoto goats. 
 It is probable that under strong price competition 
 from northern goats, and increasing personal acceptance of northern animals for purposes for which 
 (before that/before now) local species/breeds were preferred, the 
 
 29 
 
 (your share of sales out of all sales) of WAD sheep may (lower in number/get worse) further. On 
 the other hand, lower (your share of sales out of all sales) and significantly 
 higher (changed to make better/changed to fit new conditions) prices for WAD sheep paid by all 
 categories of buyers point to/show that there is excess 
 demand for this breed and so both producers and 
 people should benefit from increased WAD sheep 
 production. Producers and sellers will benefit by 
 targeting clearly stated/particular buyer categories and times of the 
 year because of strong buyer preferences for specific 
 species /breeds of animals for clearly stated/particular purposes and 
 because of their desire to pay different prices 
 agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with their preferences. Increasing market 
 share of northern animals in (away from cities) markets is (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) that northern producers and traders are taking 
 advantage of these (groups of customers/chances to sell products).
