 Abstract 
 More and more, (related to space or existing in space) econometric methods are becoming part of the standard toolkit of applied (people who work to find information) in farming-based, 
 (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) and development money flow/money-based studies. Anyway, applications in separate-choice settings remain few and (even though there is the existence of) its 
 appeal, applications of the Bayesian way of thinking in these settings are still fewer. We provide an easy book to the Bayesian (related to space or existing in space) 
 probit with the goal of making (easy to get to, use, or understand) to non-users a class of repeating/repetitive guess methods that have become fairly 
 (usually done) in Bayesian circles, offer an very powerful addition to applied (people who work to find information) toolkits, and are very important in Bayesian 
 (putting into) use of (related to space or existing in space) econometric models. We (show or prove) the methods and apply them to guess the 'neighbourhood 
 effect' in high-cooperating with/producing/giving up variety (HYV) adoption among Bangladeshi rice producers. We guess the strength of this relationship 
 using a standard, (related to space or existing in space) probit model and compare the policy ends/end results with and without the neighbourhood effect included.

 1. Introduction 
 Separate-choice models (lots of) many areas of 
 farming-based money flow/money-based studies, including technology adoption and land-use decision making. Unavoidably, these 
 problems are seen as some form of (related to space or existing in space) 
 dependence. Although accounting for (related to space or existing in space) interactions is becoming common in applications involving 
 continuous (things that change (like test scores) because of other things that you control (like study times)), such aspects are 
 rarely included into separate-choice models. The 
 importance of accounting for (related to space or existing in space) dependence in 
 these situations cannot be over-focused. In many 
 commonly applied models with a thin sliceal

 element, ignoring (related to space or existing in space) relations can make/give ordinary estimators (not agreeing/not happening in the same way) and/or (created unfair thinking in)/(unfair-thinking). In 
 some cases, (related to space or existing in space) limits/guidelines also have important 
 policy relevance. For example, the (related to space or existing in space) autoregression limit/guideline (the 'neighbourhood effect') in a 
 technology adoption setting contains important policy 
 information for public policy planning (Case, 1992). 
 Knowledge of the location and scale of its distribution 
 can be important in informing extension agents and 
 planners about the chance that initial investments 
 will create further 'secondary' or 'copy' adoption 
 in a place. And this information, in turn, can aid 
 decision making so that research (mix of stocks, bonds, etc./document collection) and public 
 investment schedules are optimised. 
 One reason likely for the shortage of (related to space or existing in space) separatechoice modelling is the complex difficulty that it involves. Most 
 of the available methods involve multidimensional

 integration. Bayesian ways of doing things including Markov-chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) methods provide a 
 powerful means to avoid these problems. The advantages of this approach compared to available other choices include non-reliance on asymptotic properties 
 to secure/make sure of truth/trueness and generation of standard errors as a 
 (something produced along with something else) of the guess computer code. The Bayesian 
 approach provides a powerful other choice to ordinary sampling explanation ways of doing things in handling many 
 tricky issues that face applied (related to space or existing in space) research 
 (Anselin, 1988). Now in farming-based money flow/money-based studies, 
 however, application of the Bayesian way of thinking is not 
 (existing all over a large area). Our goal in this paper is to provide 
 a step-by-step approach to the Bayesian (related to space or existing in space) probit 
 demonstrating its reliance on basic building blocks 
 with which many of us are familiar and as a (something produced along with something else), (showing or proving) the full power of a class of ways of doing things that are now becoming common place in other 
 areas of applied research. 
 We focus attention on one of the two Bayesian 
 models that have been applied (not very long ago) to put into use 
 cut short and separate-choice data, namely, the (related to space or existing in space)ly autoregressive probit (SARP) model, which is 
 the (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) of choice for modelling new technology adoption and is the model applied in the scientific section of the paper. (teacher and teaching-related)ly, the Bayesian 
 (related to space or existing in space) probit is only a step-wise (big statement based on very little information) of the 
 MCMC (usually done) that must guess the standard, (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy)-linear model. Because it represents the 
 very important part of almost all MCMC work in applied 
 Bayesian science and our main goals are teaching-related, the (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) model provides a natural starting 
 point from which to incorporate added/more math-based and institutional detail. A focus on (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) 
 data provides, this way, ideal reason for understanding the added/more (problems, delays, etc.) that (related to space or existing in space) dependencies 
 involve. 
 Section 2 presents an introduction to MCMC methods using (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) data and outlines the Gibbs sampling 
 computer code that is the most important part of the (related to space or existing in space) probit 
 computer code. This introductory section is meant for 
 readers who are unfamiliar with Markov-chain methods and maybe, the Bayesian view. Section 3 extends 
 the basic method to a (related to space or existing in space) econometric model with 
 continuous left-hand side data and incorporates two 
 silly/easy changes to get the (related to space or existing in space) probit computer code. Section 4 introduces institutional detail clearly connected with or related to the scientific application and introduces the 
 
 Bangladeshi data and Section 5 presents the results 
 of the (related to space or existing in space) probit computer code applied to the data. 
 Ends/end results are offered in Section 6. Throughout, the 
 focus is on (usually done) application of MCMC to solve 
 difficulties arising due to (related to space or existing in space) dependence. 
 
 2. (Acts of showing or proving) nsing (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) data 
 
 = 
 
 Suppose data y 
 (YI, yz, ... , YN ) 1 are (usually/ in a common and regular way) 
 distributed with unknown mean, f(British pounds), and unknown variance a 2 so that the data-creating model is 
 (1) 
 
 i = 1, 2, ... , N; where fL represents the mean of the 
 distribution for y; C:i the random error term that is 
 (usually/ in a common and regular way) distributed with mean zero and variance a 2 ; 
 and because of this, we may write, in a standard note, cJ, 
 t:z, ... , C:N "' iid N(f(British pounds), a 2 ). We watch/notice the data, y, 
 but do not watch/notice the errors, e 
 (cJ, t:z, ... , t:N)', 
 nor the limits/guidelines fL and a; and the goal is to 
 make (producing a lot with very little waste) use of y in getting/taking guesses about fL 
 and a. 
 Eq. (1), together with the distributional idea (you think is true) on the error term, is sometimes referred to as the 
 'normal-means model'. Because this data-creating 
 model is so familiar it serves as a natural starting 
 point from which to introduce a plain and common thing/not a brand-name drug note that 
 we keep/hold throughout the (acts of showing or proving). We continue 
 to use y 
 (Yl, yz, ... , y N ) 1 to represent data but use 
 JA(blc, d, ... , z) to represent a chance density function (pdf) for the data where the symbols 'A, b, c, d,' 
 and 'z' represent, (match up each pair of items in order), the form of the density, 
 its argument, and any limits/guidelines that are needed to 
 charaterise its location and scale, skewness, kurtosis, 
 and so on. This approach is important and fairly standard in Bayesian developments where conditioning is 
 of most important importance. 
 It is important to note for later developments that the 
 function/(-) is in the form of a (may or may not happen, depending on something) pdf. Sometimes this conditioning will play a important role in getting/taking (producing a lot with very little waste) guess plans and sometimes it will 
 not, and we make a point of showing/representing when conditioning is important through the notef(-1Â·) (the (numbers that change/things that change) coming before the slash depending on the ones that 
 follow). In the big picture  of the data-creating model 
 JA(blc, d, ... , z), our job  is to use (capable of being seen and known) data 
 'b' to make guesses about (numbers that change/things that change) (limits/guidelines) 
 
 = 
 
 = 
 
 G. Holloway et a !.I Farming-based Money flow 27 (2002) 383-402 
 
 'c, d, ... , z,' which we will refer to together as the 
 unknowns, or, compactly, bye, f:J=(c, d, ... ' z)'. 
 The point of departure between the present (thing that's given/work that's done) and others within this Special Issue, is the 
 single (instance of watching, noticing, or making a statement) that, because the limits/guidelines in e 
 are unknown they are, of course, random and have, 
 therefore, connected chance distributions. In other 
 words, for the purpose of developments in terms of 
 EJ, recognition that its elements are unknown hints 
 that they are 'random'. 
 It is this step and this single step alone from which 
 all later developments come from and it is important to bear this mind as we develop our MCMC 
 plan to guess the Bayesian (related to space or existing in space) pro bit model. 
 This application needs/demands two inputs, namely a chance for the whole data, which we represent l(f:Jjy), 
 and a prior pdf describing doubt about the 
 unknown limits/guidelines, which we represent :rr(EJ). The 
 idea (you think is true) that the errors are independent allows 
 us to multiply the individual (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) densities making up the chance into the form .ece IY) = ni 
 JN (Yi lfL, O"), which, when viewed as a function ofthe 
 complete data, y, is watched/followed to have the (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) form 
 
 l(EJjy) 
 
 = 
 
 fN (yltNfL, I NO") 
 
 (2) 
 
 where tN (Greek 'i' with subscript 'N') represents an 
 N-dimensional unit vector and IN represents the N x N 
 identity matrix. To draw guesses about e, we will 
 update between the prior pdf :rr(f:J) and the (rear end/away from the head) 
 pdf :rr(EJjy) making use of Bayes' rule 
 :rr(EJiy) ex l(EJiy):rr(f:J) 
 
 (3) 
 
 The right-side of Eq. (3) leaves out the scale factor that 
 makes the important of the left side equal to one and 
 hence, permits its (understanding/ explanation) as a true pdf. The fact 
 that we can avoid the computations suggested by 
 the importants 
 
 is worth stressing because it is exactly these computations that are the major (tripping while walking/making a mistake) blocks to the 
 (existing all over a large area) application of the Bayesian way of thinking. 
 Although important exceptions exist (see, for example, the papers referred to by Dorfman (1998)), this 
 
 385 
 
 development seems to have been more (mentally much slower than most people) in the 
 farming-based money flow/money-based studies books than in other places. The 
 coming of MCMC has, of course, changed this situation in other places and will do the same in farming-based 
 money flow/money-based studies-once the full power of the way of doing things is 
 widely accepted. With this goal in mind, it is useful 
 to note that the term on the right-hand side of Eq. (4) 
 is the not important chance for the data, a amount that 
 plays a important role in model comparisons. We will not 
 begin/try model comparisons in this paper, although 
 it is useful to note that the methods presented can be 
 extended in a simple way to test model chances (Chib, 1995; Chib and Jeliazkov, 2001). The main 
 point for math-based gains is that, because f(y) is 
 not a function of e we can ignore it in later 
 developments concerning e. These later developments will usually involve the description 
 of not important pdfs for the model limits/guidelines and the 
 hard  job  arguing with us is the derivation of these 
 not important amounts from the combined (rear end/away from the head) through 
 the integrations

 Derivation of the not important distribution of an unknown amount of interest is the target of a Bayesian 
 (act of asking questions and trying to find the truth about something). Problems arise when the not important density may not exist (not thought about/believed here); or, if the 
 not important density exists but may not have moments that 
 do (thought about/believed in the scientific section); or, when the 
 not important pdf exists but may not have a form for which 
 the (combining different things together so they work as one unit) constant (the constant that makes the 
 area beneath the density sum to one) is available in 
 closed form. It is exactly this latter situation in which 
 MCMC and a special case, the Gibbs sampler, have 
 particular advantages in fully using (may or may not happen, depending on something) dependencies that win in almost all (related to studying numbers) settings. 
 When the not important distributions are not available in 
 closed form, but the fully (may or may not happen, depending on something) distributions, 
 n(8jl81, e2, ... ' ej-], ej+], ... ' ek, y) make happy weak 
 (happening over and over again in a predictable way) conditions (Gelfand and Smith, 1990) and 
 are easy to sample from, the Gibbs sampler provides 
 an very powerful and easy-to-implement approach to test out draws from the not important pdf. In 
 
 386

 short, the Gibbs sampler provides a route for sampling from the not important pdf even though we cannot 
 express it clearly. And when the fully (may or may not happen, depending on something) 
 distributions are not all available in closed form a 
 (big statement based on very little information) of the Gibbs sampler known as the 
 City-Hastings computer code can then be used to 
 test out from the target distribution. Although it needs/demands more computation time than the Gibbs sampler, 
 it is just as powerful and is more (able to do many different things well) due to the 
 fewer conditions that are needed/demanded for its use. Two 
 examples will help to (show or prove). 
 
 2.1. The Gibbs sampler 
 
 (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) means, 
 
 2 &#126; 2 (y-tN!L)'(y-tNf.l,)} 
 (6) 
 
 which changes from combining the non-interesting 
 prior n(f.J,, u) ex u- 1 (Jeffreys, 1961; Zellner, 1996, 
 p. 708), with the chance (Eq. (2)) via Baye's 
 rule (Eq. (3)). The full (may or may not happen, depending on something)s are n(fLiu, y) = 
 !N (!Lifl, u) and n(uifL, y) 
 ! 1G(uiv, s 2 ), s 2 
 (y- LN!L)'(y- LN!L)/v, which we get from the 
 combined distribution simply by viewing it only as a function of a single unknown amount and then identifying 
 that the resulting form is well known. The Gibbs sampler operates by repeating/looping (one after the other) between these 
 two (may or may not happen, depending on something) distributions drawing, in turn, an 
 inverse-gamma random (number or thing that changes) and a (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) random 
 (number or thing that changes). For S (good or well enough) large, and a starting value

 In the (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy)-means set-up, the not important distribution for fL, is at distribution which, in its non-standardised form, is seen as its mean, fl (t&#126;lN)- 1 t&#126;y; its d.f., v=N- 1; and its scale, &amp; 2 = 
 (y- tNfl)'(y- tNfl)/v. The not important distribution 
 for u is an inverse-gamma distribution with degrees 
 of freedom v and scale &amp;2 . The two not important distributions n(fLIY) = fT (&#126;Lifl, v, &amp;2 ) and n(ujy) = 
 j 1G(ujv, &amp;2 )) offer a complete description of the 
 unknown amounts and are the target of the exercise. Although these not important distributions are easily 
 received/got by direct (combination of different things together that work as one unit), we are interested in 
 describing them through the Gibbs sample, for 
 which we require the full (may or may not happen, depending on something) distributions. 
 To get these distributions we need to first establish 
 the form of the joint (rear end/away from the head)

 and Figs. 2 and 3 compare the frequencies of draws 
 received/got from the first 1000 cycles of the sample 
 with frequencies created by the target pdfs. The 
 figures illustrate three important points. First, independent of the starting values, the draws copy the 
 actual draws one expects to get in draws from the 
 true not important pdfs. Second, few cycles are needed/demanded 
 before the Gibbs sequence comes together to the true pdfs. 
 Third, when it is focused that there are only 10 
 (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) in the sample, coming together is received/got 
 under very limited information.

 City-Hastings (RW) computer code. Although its 
 roots are old (City et al., 1953; Hastings, 1970), 
 it is hard to locate applications of the way of doing things 
 in farming-based money flow/money-based studies. The RW computer-related is only 
 one of many versions of a basic accept-reject procedure which are good to model (related to space or existing in space) dependence. 
 Space limits prevent reporting results across an 
 organized row of models that the authors experimented with 
 in the course of this project; but the RW computer code 
 proved much superior in terms of execution 
 time and gave/given correct guesses of system limits/guidelines with no trouble. Like the Gibbs sequence, 
 the RW sequence creates a Markov chain with desirable coming together properties; but, unlike the Gibbs 
 sampler only a subset of the proposed draws in the computer code are accepted. This key difference makes 
 the search for 'efficient' plans to improve the 
 basic computer code desirable and this goal is an (happening now) 
 focus in (related to studying numbers) research (see, especially, Raftery 
 and Lewis, 1992; Robert, 1995; Gilks et al., 1996). 
 Continuing with note developed (before that/before now), and 
 the (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy)-means example, suppose that we wish 
 to test out a draw from the target density j(t-J,IÂ·), 
 which is not of a standard form. We get a draw- 
 
 a 'proposal' -from another distribution that, among 
 other properties, is known (known (combining different things together so they work as one unit) constant) and is easy to sample from, and we accept and 
 reject the proposals based on a chance rule that 
 results in the accepted sequence of draws creating a 
 Markov chain that, eventually, comes together to the target 
 distribution. Use m to represent the proposal value and 
 use.f(mlÂ·) to represent the proposal density. In general, 
 the proposal density can be (may or may not happen, depending on something) on a prior 
 draw for the limit/guideline of interest and because of this, let us 
 use .f (mlt-J,) to represent the conditioning. The defining 
 feature of the RW computer code is that the current draw 
 for the limit/guideline, m, depends on the previous draw, f.J,, 
 through a random walk. In other words, the proposal 
 and current values are related through the condition 
 (7) 
 
 where 
 
 8 
 
 is a random (disturbing or causing a small change in something) with distribution 
 
 fp(8) that is independent of f.J, (and therefore, m). 
 It follows from Eq. (7) that the proposal distribution 
 
 has the form JP(m- t-J,) and we think about/believe a second 
 experiment. 
 Suppose that the distribution for 8 is the standard (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) distribution fp(8) = fN (810, 1). The 
 
 G. Holloway et a!. I Farming-based Money flow 27 (2002) 383-402 
 
 distribution form is JN (mlf-L, 1) and we go ahead by 
 (one after the other) drawing from the (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) distribution 
 with mean the current draw 1-L and variance one. Then, 
 the following steps test out draws from the target distributions of interest (Robert and Casella, 1999). Step 
 1: create a starting value 1-L = f-L 1 - Step 2: create 
 m &#126; jP(mif-L). Step 3: create L{ &#126; j 0 (MI0, 1). 
 Step 4: if L{ :S f(m)jf(M) set f-L = m. Step 5: return 
 to step 2. 
 Fig. 4 presents plots of the first 50 cycles of the 
 Gibbs sequence with the draw for 1-L tested out by the 
 RW step. The draws are almost the same as the draws 
 from the Gibbs sample and they copy the values of 
 the actual limit/guideline values used to create the data. 
 Figs. 5 and 6 present plots of the histograms created 
 by the first 1000 draws. The (like the real thing) densities are 
 quite close to the actual target densities. In summary, 
 the RW computer code provides a (able to do many different things well) other choice to the 
 Gibbs sampler to test out draws from the two target 
 distributions. 
 The methods applied in this section are the building blocks of almost all the versions of the Gibbs

 sampler and the City-Hastings computer code that 
 appear in the books. Together, these steps provide an very powerful tool kit from which the 
 investigator can launch more fancy (or smart) analyses. 
 Now/recently, Bayesian research is not held back by 
 the need to provide number-based guesses to hard  important calculations by area methods such as 
 Simpson's rule. Freed from the restrictions that these 
 integrations have in past bound (acts of asking questions and trying to find the truth about something), we are 
 now in a position to extend the (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy)-means (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) to the target setting of (related to space or existing in space) probit guess. 
 A moving around/misleading and tricking that aids this link and is important 
 in later developments is to write x 
 lN and 
 f3 
 L{ in the data-creating model in (3) and recall the definitions of the means and variances in the 
 original model, namely fl 
 (x' x) -I x' y 
 &#126; and 
 s2 
 (y- xf3)'(y- xJ{)jv, with x, anN x K matrix of (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) on a set or (connected/related) covariates and 
 hence, f3 represents a K-vector and v N- K. So, the 
 (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy)-linear moving backward model has also been correctly tested out through the Gibbs and random walk 
 City-Hastings computer codes.

 3. (related to space or existing in space) models 
 The previous section based on the (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy)-means 
 ((usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy)-linear moving backward) model serves to illustrate 
 the powerful way in which the different computer codes 
 serve as other choices to ordinary approaches (direct (combination of different things together that work as one unit) in the case of (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) data) to get 
 guesses with respect to a target not important distribution. But the (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) data (surrounding conditions) is, of course, 
 overly-simple and the results of the (acts of showing or proving), especially the (quality of being very close to the truth or true number) of the received/made from distributions, can 
 be questioned. Such (doubting a lot of things) is, we show, not deserved because the two (related to space or existing in space) models of interest-the 
 (related to space or existing in space) autoregressive (SAR) model and the SARP 
 model-are but simple extensions of the (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy)-linear 
 (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built). 
 A principal source of information for learning about 
 these models in the Bayesian (surrounding conditions) are the papers (LeSage, 1997, 2000, 2002) and much of what 
 we present in this section is a 'resampling' of some of 
 this work, together with a few personal communications about different sampling issues. We now continue 
 a step-by-step development of the extensions from the 
 (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) moving backward model that are needed in (related to space or existing in space) guessing. Unlike that model, (related to space or existing in space) problems create 
 distributions for which the not important pdfs are not available in closed form and require application of MCMC 
 methods. In this case, measures of (quality of being very close to the truth or true number) are now 
 no longer available for all of the limits/guidelines in question. Anyway, it is possible with what we have 
 established so far to give a (experience-based thinking) indication of what 
 a correctly used computer code should produce. 
 Before presenting results from (like the real thing) probit 
 data, we think about/believe the standard (related to space or existing in space) (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built), 
 where the (thing that changes (like a test score) because of something else that you control (like study time)) is a known continuous 
 measure of watched/followed data. The development is almost the same 
 to that of Anselin, 2002 (this issue). We are concerned 
 with the model

 where Y(Nxl) 
 (yl,y2, ... ,yN)' represents (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) on a (thing that changes (like a test score) because of something else that you control (like study time)) of interest across (related to space or existing in space)ly delimited units, i = 1, 2, ... , N; P(lxl) represents 
 relationship between units; W(NxN) represents a (related to space or existing in space)weight matrix, defined in more detail, (after that);x(NxK)

 represents the ceteris paribus relationship between x

 ((British pounds)1,(British pounds)2, ... ,(British pounds)N)' represents random error, which, we assume, is distributed (usually/ in a common and regular way) 
 with mean zero and covariance a 2 IN; in other words, 
 e &#126; fN (eiON, a 2IN), where ON is the length-N null 
 vector and IN is the dimension-N identity matrix. 
 The econometrician watches/states x, w and y and makes 
 guesses about p, p and a. 
 Eq. (8) is the data-creating equation for the SAR 
 model. The SAR model is one of two ordinary 
 (detailed descriptions of exactly what is required) discussed in the books. The other 
 model allows for relationships among errors across the 
 (related to space or existing in space) units. Our main interest in the scientific part 
 of this paper concerns relationship across the (things that change (like test scores) because of other things that you control (like study times)) (not the errors) and so, for this reason 
 and the interests of space, we focus on the SAR creation. Developments for both models are present 
 neatly in LeSage (2000), Eqs. (1)-(7). The scientific 
 application to follow (gives a reason to do something) the (related to space or existing in space) relationship-related 
 limit/guideline, p, and the important (related to space or existing in space)-weight matrix, 
 w. Suppose that our interest lies in guessing the 
 relationship across crop yields in touching settings 
 (a situation only (a) little different from our scientific application) and suppose that, maybe for policy 
 purposes, we are interested in guessing the extent to 
 which yields in connected areas are related; areas 
 with high yields, probably, connected with touching high-cooperating with/producing/giving up areas, and so on. In this setting 
 w represents an assignment of ones and zeros going along with/matching up to touching areas, such that, Wij = 1 if (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) i andj are in the same 'location' and Wij = 
 0, otherwise, i, j = 1, 2, ... , N, i =I= j. We assume 
 that the relationship between an (instance of watching, noticing, or making a statement) unit and 
 itself is zero and because of this, that wu = 0, i = 1, 2, ... , N. 
 In most practical uses of this model it is usual/usually done to (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy)ise each row of w such that each of 
 the Ni ( &amp;lt;N) touching units affecting (instance of watching, noticing, or making a statement) i 
 has one Nith (thing that's given/work that's done) to the total hit/effect on i; but 
 this (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy)isation is not necessary. The condition p =I= 
 0 hints relationship within locations and forces endogeneity (qua (happening at the same time)) between the crop yields; 
 and the condition p = 0 hints that there is no relationship and forces the model to collapse to the standard 
 multivariate model, which can be handled without the 
 need to Gibbs sample (Zellner, 1996). The comparison 
 in the non-(related to space or existing in space) big picture  is simply the difference between a (happening together)-equations set-up and its reduced 
 
 = 
 
 392

 form and the presence of non-zero p is the defining 
 honor/difference, in fact the reason for existence for the MCMC 
 approach. But more exactly, it is the combination of 
 the combined hits/effects of w and p that lead to endogeneity, and whereas p represents an unseen limit/guideline with an connected chance distribution that 
 must be guessed, w represents given data. It is useful to 
 note in passing that it would be desirable to guess 
 the elements of w but that the most useful limit/guidelineisations lead to identification problems. We suspect 
 that the development of more strong (detailed descriptions of exactly what is required) of 
 w is, maybe, the most productive avenue for advances in 
 (related to space or existing in space) methods, at least where adoption issues are the 
 focus. Finally, this statement assumes deeper meaning 
 when it is recognised that (at least, in experimental 
 settings) the choices of w and p are not independent. 
 In fact, as Anselin (1988) shows any draw for p in a 
 City-Hastings big plan/layout/dishonest plan must make happy 
 
 fix two of these constant when developing the Gibbs 
 plan for guess. First, in getting/taking the (may or may not happen, depending on something) distribution for u, we treat 3{ and p as known 
 constants. Given 3{ and p, (careful examination of something) of (10) and comparison with (Zellner, 1996 (a.37)) shows/tells about that the 
 (rear end/away from the head) for u has the form 
 
 (9) 
 
 &#126; =- (x'x)- 1x'z and Vt =- u 2 (x'x)- 1 . So, the full 
 (may or may not happen, depending on something) distribution for 3{ is multivariate (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) 
 with mean &#126; and covariance matrix V fl. Finally, with 
 u and 3{ assumed fixed, we watch/notice that the form of 
 the (rear end/away from the head) for p is exactly the form of the joint 
 (rear end/away from the head) (10). That is, n:(plu, 3{, y) ex .n:(@ly) and 
 no further simplification is possible. Due to the appearance of the (thing that decides something) resulting from the Jacobian change, this density does not have a 
 well-known form and because of this, we are in the situation 
 (gave a reason to do something) (before that/before now) of needing/ordering the use of a 
 City-Hastings step to test out draws for p. 
 As we organized and listed above in the case of the RW computer code, we will need a proposal density from which to 
 create draws. The (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) distribution is a natural 
 choice in each of the three cases because, 
 net of the Jacobian term, IAI, the fully (may or may not happen, depending on something) density for p is (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) with known mean and variance. 
 More exactly, by completing the square in p it is 
 possible to write for p 
 
 where f!. is the inverse of the minimum eigenvalue of 
 w and p is the inverse of the maximum eigenvalue. 
 With reference to (8), in the case p = 0, we have 
 the (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy)-linear model and all of the previous results go through, with the re-thinking and re-doing that K = 1 
 and f.L(lxl) = f3(Kxl) and X(NxK) = L(Nxl)Â· As a result, the extension to think about  (related to space or existing in space) effects rests 
 importantly on the distribution for p. We will follow 
 the practice organized and listed above and use a non-interesting 
 prior pdf for the unknowns EJ=-(p, 3{, u)', form the 
 chance for the unknowns (may or may not happen, depending on something) on the data, 
 y; and study the form of the resulting (rear end/away from the head) as a 
 starting point to formal analysis. The (rear end/away from the head) is 
 n:(EJ IY) ex IAiu-&amp;lt;N+l) exp { 
 
 2&#126; 2 (Ay-x3{)' (Ay-x3{)} 
 (10) 
 
 where A(NxN) =- IN - pw rises from the Jacobian 
 of the change between y and (British pounds). It is important for later developments to recognise that the matrix A contains the unknown limit/guideline p and that, 
 when p = 0, A = IN and the model reduces to 
 the (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy)-linear moving backward model. However, even for 
 non-zero relationship, the combined (rear end/away from the head) for e is very 
 almost the same as  the (rear end/away from the head) for the (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy)-means model 
 and so, many of those same ideas win. Because 
 there are now three parts/pieces of interest, we must 
 
 .n:(ulf3, p, y) ex 
 
 iÂ°Culv, s2 ) 
 
 (11) 
 
 = 
 
 an inverse-gamma distribution with v = N and s 2 
 (Ay- x3{)'(Ay- x3{)jv. Because of this, the dependence of 
 u on 3{, p and y is through s 2 . Second, holding u 
 and p constant, the (rear end/away from the head) is in an identical form to 
 the multivariate moving backward model with the dependent 
 (number or thing that changes) redefined to be Z(Nxl) = Yes. As a result, 
 all of Zellner's results (Zellner, 1996, pp. 65-66) go 
 through with this re-thinking and re-doing and we find that the 
 (may or may not happen, depending on something) distribution for 3{, has the form 
 n:(f31p, u, y) ex fN (31&amp;#126{;, V fi)

 G. Holloway et al./ Farming-based Money flow 27 (2002) 383-402 
 
 (reasonable/showing good judgment) to choose as the proposal distribution a (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) density. And this is what we do in the (act of showing or proving) that follows. 
 In the experiment we use the data in Table 1 (column 
 2), which are (like the real thing) from the model (8) with e = 
 (p, 3{, 0") 1 = (-0.75, -1.0, 1.0)' and (column 3) x &#126; 
 fN (xiON, 10/ N). In each of the three cases we sample (one after the other) with the insertion of an added step 
 to test out the draw for p, the (may or may not happen, depending on something) pdf of which 
 is not available in known form. We use r to represent the 
 candidate draws from the proposal density and use p to 
 represent an accepted draw. Some experiments suggested 
 that an acceptance rate of around 50% produced stable 
 guesses in a good manner and we endogenised the 
 step size of the RW computer code by allowing the standard moving away in the random walk error, &#126;, to increase 
 ((match up each pair of items in order), decrease) by a scale factor 1.1 whenever 
 the acceptance rate went beyond the upper bound from 
 below (went beyond the lower bound from above) in a 
 band set at acceptance rate limits of 40 and 60%. 
 Fig. 7 plots the first 100 draws in the Gibbs sequence 
 with the RW step inserted. The sequence was quick to 
 come together and produced draws for each of the three limits/guidelines that are close to the given values used to gen- 
 
 393 
 
 erate the data, namely (p, 3{, 0") 1 
 (-0.75, -1, 1). 
 The sample was gotten in less than a minute of real 
 time. Fig. 8 presents plots of the histograms for p created from the experiment. The distribution is centred 
 close to the given limit/guideline value ( -0.75) and is about (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy). Experiments with different start 
 values created almost identical distributions and 
 we decide that the RW-Gibbs sequence produces 
 strong guesses of the SAR model limits/guidelines. 
 3.1. Random walk City sampling the 
 Bayesian (related to space or existing in space) probit 
 Our final (act of showing or proving) is the (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) we apply 
 to the scientific model introduced in the next section. 
 Having gave/given a (experience-based thinking) reason for the methods in the big picture  of continuous sample data, y, we 
 think about/believe the use of the RW computer code to the 
 (related to space or existing in space) probit model. With reference to (8), we are now 
 concerned with the model

 (yJ,Y2, ... ,yN)' are hidden/covered up and in 
 terms of our desire for step-by-step development, we 
 have introduced one added/more unknown into the 
 model. As a result, the Gibbs sampling computer code 
 will require one added/more step for its putting into use 
 and that step-as one might expect-is to get a 
 draw for the hidden/covered up endogenous (number or thing that changes), z, from its 
 fully (may or may not happen, depending on something) distribution. This distribution is received/got by understanding/explaining the (rear end/away from the head) only as a function 
 of the unknown vector z and by completing the square 
 in the huge part of the (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) kernel. The product is the cut short, multivariate-(usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) distribution

 where 
 (A'A)- 1A'xfi and V.z 
 CJ 2 (A'A)- 1 and 
 the cutting off makes happy the conditions stated in the 
 data-creating model (14). Although this single step 
 is only a small/short difficulty over the SAR computer code, 
 drawing from this (may or may not happen, depending on something) distribution can present/cause 
 problems. This is because a simple acceptance big plan/layout/dishonest plan 
 within which/by which the hidden/covered up z is accepted if each part makes happy the (state where two things are not the same) restrictions has a very small chance 
 of acceptance. Except for very small problems, this 
 method is (math-based) silly/not doable. The approach 
 
 suggested by Geweke (1992) and adopted (before that/before now) 
 by LeSage (2002) is to use the acceptance big plan/layout/dishonest plan on 
 the fully (may or may not happen, depending on something) distributions for each of the parts/pieces of the vector z. However, this approach can 
 still result in an unreasonably large number of rejected 
 draws. The other choice is to keep/hold the (may or may not happen, depending on something) approach but use (producing a lot with very little waste) one-for-one draws by applying the chance important change (e.g. Mood et al., 
 1974). We found that both methods created correct 
 guesses, but that the chance important change 
 method was far superior in terms of execution time. 
 One added/more change to the previous computer code is needed/demanded before putting into use. This (change to make better/related to changing something) is to fix one of the unknown limits/guidelines in order 
 to identify the other unknowns in the model. This is the 
 familiar scaling problem arising in ordinary probit 
 guess because the probit model is valid only up to 
 a scalar change. The usual practice, which we 
 adopt here, is to fix the variance at one. Because of this, ( 14) 
 is used by forcing the restriction CJ = 1. 
 An experiment uses the second and third columns of 
 Table 1. Note in column 2 that four of the endogenous 
 values are positive and six are negative. If we test out 
 draws assuming that these binary results represent

 the watched/followed data we expect to get draws for the 
 hidden/covered up data that are centred about the endogenous 
 y values. This mostly, is the case and although 
 space prohibits reporting the chance distribution 
 so received/got, the histogram for p is only (a) little different from the distribution received/got from the (related to space or existing in space) 
 model with (capable of being seen and known), continuous response data. 
 Fig. 9 compares the draws for the (related to space or existing in space) econometric 
 model (SAR) and the (related to space or existing in space) probit model (SARP). 
 The (like the real thing) frequencies from the SARP model are 
 the unfilled bars and the frequencies tested out by 
 the SAR model are the filled bars. Both sets of frequencies are created from a Gibbs sample of 1000 
 accepted draws. The start values for p in the two models are the same and we follow a suggestion in Albert 
 and Albert and Chibs (1993) using z0 = y as the start 
 value in the (related to space or existing in space) probit computer code. Experiments 
 with other start values suggest that the results are independent of this choice. Except for some skewness 
 in the draws from the probit model, the frequencies 
 created by the two models are very much alike. 
 In summary, the Gibbs sampler provides an very powerful way of doing things for testing out from a 
 
 not important distribution that is not available in closed 
 form. The addition of a City step within the 
 computer code provides (large/relatively large) (ability to do different things) that helps guess of (related to space or existing in space) econometric and (related to space or existing in space) probit models. The way of doing things is attractive and 
 when viewed as a set of logical extensions to the 
 (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy)-linear model, is mostly rather simple. Its practical putting into use met with few (blocking or stopping things) in a hardware/software (surrounding conditions) that is widely available 
 to other (people who work to find information). The way of doing things provides correct 
 guesses of (related to space or existing in space) model limits/guidelines and appears 
 to be very strong, working well in a limitedinformation (surrounding conditions) (only 10 (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements)). 
 The success of the way of doing things in the experimental settings raises (large/relatively large) scope for its computer program in 
 scientific work. Finally, in response to a (connected/related) question 
 by the Editor, it is worth pointing out that the ways of doing things developed in the section are easily extendible 
 to cases where the binary decision is begun/tried on

 4. Scientific application 
 Application of the SAR probit model, Eq. (14) to 
 neighbourhood effects in high-cooperating with/producing/giving up variety (HYV) 
 rice adoption changes from previous work by Case 
 (1992). Readers are referred to that source for further 
 details and (desire to do something/reason for doing something). Briefly, a farmer's expected 
 (money made/good thing received) from adopting an HYV plant, in place of a local 
 variety (LV) depends upon a set of price (numbers that change/things that change) (input and output prices), a set of fixed factors (say, farm 
 valuable things, land holding), a set of (related to how much money and power people have) (features/ qualities/ traits) (for example, education, wealth), and neighbourhood influences (expected (money made/good things received) to neighbours 
 from adoption). The first three sets of (features/ qualities/ traits) 
 are, of course, standard fare in adoption models. They 
 are accounted for by the matrix X(NxK) in Eq. (14). 
 The fourth effect is, of course, modelled through the 
 combination of the (related to space or existing in space) weight matrix W(NxN) and 
 the (related to space or existing in space) relationship-related limit/guideline p. In Case's computer program to sickle-harvester adoption in Java, the term 
 'neighbours' refers to all other farmers in the same 
 district. All neighbours are weighted equally, and the 
 neighbourhood effects for each farmer are (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy)ised 
 to 1. In other words, the row restriction LJWiJ= 1 
 is forced column wise on the rows. In the words/word choices of Anselin (2002), this (detailed description of exactly what is required) is a form 
 of (related to certain things being ranked above or below other things) (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy)-linear model, where the 'common higher-order level' is a district. We apply almost the same 
 (understandings/ explanations) in this scientific application, with the 
 higher-order level represented by villages. 
 In the Bangladeshi big picture, rice is the staple for the 
 majority of people/of the group, and the mostly 
 land-related (process of people making, selling, and buying things) revolves around the production of 
 rice in three seasons (Eunus, 2001). Food security continues to be a most important concern, with the population expanding by 2.2 million a year. The Bangladesh 
 Rice Research Institute has released dozens of varieties of HYV s over the years, and these modern varieties are known to enable (in a big way) better yields 
 than local varieties. In spite of such varietal development and progress in crop-watering/rinsing with water provision, Bangladesh 
 has one of the lowest HYV adoption rates in Asia 
 
 (Azam, 1996). The adoption issue is this way a critical one 
 for Bangladesh. 
 A books does exist on HYV adoption in 
 Bangladesh, mostly employing OLS or probit (moving backwards) of adoption on (numbers that change/things that change) such as farm size and 
 farmer education (see, for example, Kashem, 1987; 
 Horseain, 1989; Ahmed and Horseain, 1990; Alauddin 
 and Tisdell, 1991). However, as in the wider technology adoption books, these Bangladeshi studies 
 have not thought about/believed the role played by the adoption 
 attitudes of 'neighbours' in influencing the adoption 
 decisions of individual farmers. As Case (1992) has 
 argued, ignoring neighbourhood influences not only 
 biases the guessed limits/guidelines in standard adoption 
 models, but also sacrifices important policy-(connected/related) 
 information. For example, a key way of thinking/basic truth/rule in (away from cities) 
 extension activity in many developing countries is to 
 spread around information to a (enough of something to allow something big to happen) of farmers such that positive externalities in the form of 
 'secondary' or 'copy' adoption in the place carry 
 forward the speed and power created by the first investment. The size of this externality makes up/is equal to important data for policymakers operating under limited 
 budgets and wishing to (make as big as possible) returns to extension 
 investment. 
 There is some good  (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) that a village-level 
 cooperation exists in technology adoption in Bangladesh. 
 One example of this is the experience of INTERFISH, 
 a large agriculture/aquaculture extension project designed to (help increase/show in a good way) the spread of rice-fish cropping 
 systems in (away from cities) Bangladesh. An external team looking at (again) the (challenging things accomplished or completed) of the project found that 
 'copy farmers' (secondary adopters) was full of the 
 areas where the project was based (Best et al., 1998). 
 These secondary adopters were seen to commit increasing amounts of land to the new technology following positive adoption decisions by neighbouring 
 farmers. The review team guessed that the (related to space or existing in space) 
 reach via secondary adoption could be a radius of 2 to 
 3 km and on this basis, suggested that future project 
 activities should allow (good) enough space between 
 places/locations in order to (make as big as possible) returns to the project's 
 investment. 
 Our scientific application applies the (related to space or existing in space) lag 
 model to thin sliceal, first (or most important) data for the Aman 
 (bad rainstorm rice) crop of 1996 in Bangladesh. The data 
 were collected in an intensive farm-survey coordinated 
 by one of the authors. Multistage random sampling

 Source: survey of Bangladeshi people who responded, by S. Rahman, 1995. 
 
 ways of doing things were used in selecting study locations as 
 well as the sample people who responded. In our application it is 
 assumed that the (point of view/way of behaving) towards HYV adoption for 
 farmer i depends not only on its own internal (features/ qualities/ traits), but also on the influence of other farmers 
 in the village. The effects of farmers in surrounding 
 villages is, this way, assumed to be very small. 
 The survey, done in 1996, had strict restrictions 
 on budgets and personnel, and unfortunately, was not 
 designed with (related to space or existing in space) guess in mind. So, surveys were carried out in groups of villages in each of 
 the three districts. The three groups had 6-8 villages, 
 (match up each pair of items in order), making 21 villages in total in our sample. The districts (groups) themselves are hundreds 
 of kilometres apart from each other, and therefore can 
 safely be thought about/believed not to be in each other's neighbourhoods. Within each group, individual villages are 
 between 2.5 and 8 km apart. While these are not (based on what's seen or what seems obvious) great distances, our experience of Bangladesh 
 enables us to be (well enough/good enough/in a smart way) comfortable with the 
 idea (you think is true) that none of the villages are within the 
 other's 'neighbourhood' (interactions terms between 
 villages in the w matrix are zero). Land-related activities 
 in Bangladesh are known to be (in a detailed way) linked with 
 the (related to how much money and power people have) patterns of individual villages 
 (Herbon, 1994). At the same time, villages are usually located around small waterbodies, and the farming is strongly changed to fit the local micro-relief. It 
 is therefore not surprising to find very different mixes 
 of crops and modes of production in areas just a few 
 miles away from each other. Because of these facts, 
 and given the (related to where mountains, rivers, cities, etc., are located) makeup of our data, we 
 have put into use the 'village' definition of 'neighbours'. 
 
 The survey collected information on varietal choice; 
 input and output prices; levels of fixed factors; and 
 (related to how much money and power people have) (features/ qualities/ traits) of the farm families. 
 A total of 406 (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) on local varietal use (76 
 (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements)) and modem varieties (330 (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements)) 
 make up/be equal to the sample. The (numbers that change/things that change) included in the model are the following: 
 - District: dummy (number or thing that changes) representing the district 
 in which the farm is located; 
 - NGO: dummy (number or thing that changes) pointing to/showing whether the 
 household received help from NGOs; 
 - Valuable things: value of farm valuable things in thousands of Taka; 
 - Education: number of years of education for household head; 
 - Experience: years of farming experience for household head; 
 - Household size: number of people in household; 
 - Farm size: total size of holding in hectares; 
 - Rented hectares: hectares of land rented in hectares; 
 - Market: distance from the nearest market ('growth 
 centre'), in km;
