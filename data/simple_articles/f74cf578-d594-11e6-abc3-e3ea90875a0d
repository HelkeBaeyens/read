 ABSTRACT 
 
 A (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area production function with tlme-changing/different technical 
 (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) is guessed using panel data from ICRISAT's Village Level 
 Studies in three Indian villages. A Cobb-Douglas functional form is 
 at first defined in which linear combinations of watered and unirrigated 
 land and hired and family labour are included as explanatory (numbers that change/things that change). 
 Given the sp&#126;cifications of a linearized version of the Cobb-Douglas 
 production edge of something/unexplored area with coefficients which are a linear function of time, 
 the guess of time-invariant technical inefficiency is rejected for one 
 of the three villages involved. The guess of time--invariant 
 coefficients of the explanatory (numbers that change/things that change) is rejected for two of the three 
 villages. Further, the guess that hired and. family labour are equally 
 productive is accepted in only one of the three villages. 
 The technical (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) of individual farms showed large amounts of 
 difference/different version, both in the cases of time-changing/different and time-invariant technical 
 (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste).

 Battese (1991) presents a review of 
 
 the ideas and models which have been suggested and surveys applicatlons 
 'rthich have appeared in farming-based money flow/money-based studies Journa:s. 
 Edge of something/unexplored area production functions assume the existence of technical 
 inefficiency of the differ'ent firms involved in production such that, for 
 clearly stated/particular values of factor inputs t the levels of productIon are less than what 
 would be the case if the firms were fully technically (producing a lot with very little waste). 
 
 The 
 
 majority of the earlier applications of edge of something/unexplored area production functions 
 involved thin sliceal data. 
 
 However, more (not very long ago) attempts have been 
 
 made to apply edge of something/unexplored area production functions in the analysis of time-serles 
 data on firms involved in production. 
 
 At first the firm effects connected 
 
 with the existence of technical inefficiency were assumed to be timeinva3'iant random (numbers that change/things that change) or independent. and identlcally dIstributed over 
 time. 
 
 Models for edge of something/unexplored area production functions have been proposed in which 
 
 2 
 
 the firm effects connected with technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) are. assumed to be time 
 changing/different [see Kumbhakar (1990), Cornwell. Schmidt and SIckles (1990) and

 The Econometric Model 
 The model proposed by Battese and Coelll (1991) assumes that the 
 
 production of firms Is defined by a (random/including random data points) frontlerproduction fUnction 
 
 In which the firm effects are an huge function of time, such that the 
 firms are not needed/demanded to be watched/followed In all the tIme periods involved. 
 
 The

 (If the I-th firmÂ· was

 otherwise .1(1) Is a 
 
 subset of the set of Integers from 1 to T which point to/show 'the time periods 
 t 
 
 for which (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) on the i-th firm were gotten.) 
 The firm effects, Uit , are non-negative random (numbers that change/things that change) which are 
 connected with the existence of tt:-=lmical inefficiency of the firms. 
 
 That

 The model for the firm effects, defined by equation (2), specifies that the 
 firm effects, U1t! approach Ui as t increases towards the last time period, 
 T. involved in the panel. 
 
 If the limit/guideline, 
 
 effects, Uit, decline towards U1 a 
 
 1), 
 
 is posltivethen the firm 
 
 t increases towards T. 
 
 This situation 
 
 would point to/show a decline in the level of technical Inefficiency and, because of this, 
 an increase in technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) over time. 
 As stated in Bat tese and Coelll (1991 L the huge speciflcation 
 of the behaviour of the firm effect.s over time is a stiff limit/guidelineization. 
 It hints that the technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) of the firms involved,

 is a. double huge function of time for the given 
 
 Kumbhakar (1990) assumed that the firm effects, Ult' were a more 
 
 general huge function of time involving two limits/guidelines. 
 
 No emplrlcal 
 
 applications of Kumbhakar's (1990) model have yet appeared because the model 
 has not been successfully programmed. 
 
 Cornwell, Schmidt and 
 
 Slck&#126;es 
 
 (1990) 
 
 as.sumed that the firm effects were a quadratic functlon of time in which the 
 coef.ficientswere random draws from a trivariate (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) distribution. 
 The model for the firm effects, U , defined by equation (2), assumes 
 It 
 
 that the ranklngs of the firm effects remain the same over time. 
 
 In order to 
 
 permit dIfferent orderings of the flrm effects, Uit , for the firms at

 would be needed/demanded.

 FRONTIER. written by 
 
 The FRONTIER program aSSWJles that the (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area 
 
 production function (1) is of Cobb-Douglas type. 
 
 5 
 
 Battese and Coelli (1991) illustrated the use of the FRONTIER program 
 with the analysis of a subset of the data on a. panel of sample farms from the 
 village of Aurepalle in India. 
 
 III this paper, we think about/believe the complete data 
 
 sets received/got over the ten-year perlod 1n which ICRISAT collected data from 
 the three villages of Aurepalle, Kanzaraand Shirapur. 
 3. 
 
 ICRISAT's Village Level Studies 
 The data used in this study were gotten from the International Crops 
 
 Res.earch Institute for the Semi-Dry Tropics (JCIUSAT) near Hyderabad 1n the 
 Indian .state of Andhra Pradesh. 
 
 The data are from the village level studies 
 
 (VLS) In which ICRISAT personnel collected a range of data .from .households 
 working at farming-based production in different villages in India. 
 
 As a part 
 
 of its order. ICRISAT started its village level studies 1n 1915 to get 
 reliable data on traditional farming-based methods in the Semi-Dry Trppics 
 (SAT) of India so that improved (related to computers and science) methods could be introduced 
 [see Jodha, Asokan and Ryan (1911) and Binswanger .and Jodha (1918)]_). 
 The three villages involved in the VLS studies of ICRISAT were selected 
 from districts which represented the broad agrocllmatlc smaller areas in the SAT 
 of India. 
 
 The main fact.ors thought about/believed in the selection of the districts 
 
 included soil types, rainfall and cropping pattern. 
 
 (how easy something is to get to, use, or understand) to 
 
 agricul tural universities ,')r research stations and development programs and 
 closeness to the ICRISAT's headquarters at Patancheru near Hyderabad were 
 also given important thing to think about. 
 
 Within the selected dlstricts, talukas 
 
 (subdlvisions of a district) were selected which represented the typical 
 characteristlcs in terms of land-use pattern,cropping, crop-watering/rinsing with water, 
 animals, infra-(related to what holds something together and makes it strong) development. population, etc. 
 
 Villages which 
 
 were located near large towns or have special government or other programs 
 were not thought about/believed In the sample. 
 
 The data used in this study were 
 
 6 
 
 collected from three villages, Aurepalle, shirapur and Kanzara, during the 
 years 1975 to 1985. 
 
 Data on factor inputs and total productIon were. received/got 
 
 for a random. sample of families in each village. 
 All families in each vlllage were divided into two main groups. 
 
 The 
 
 farming-based labour group consisted of families operating less than 0.2 
 hectares of operated land and the (related to growing plants) group consisted of families 
 operating at least 0.2 hectares of land. 
 
 The (related to growing plants) group was further 
 
 classified into three equal groups and ranked as small, medium and large 
 farmers depending on the size of their holdings. 
 A random sample of ten families was selected from each group of 
 .If 
 
 farmers including the farming-based labour group so that 40 sample farmers 
 were selected from each village. 
 
 However, this stUdy does not include the 
 
 farming-based labour group for the purpose of the analysis of the frontIer 
 production function. 
 
 During the ten-year period involved, some families 
 
 which were (at first/before other things happened) cl:l.ssified as labour farmers became small farmers In 
 the later years and because of this were included in the sample. 
 
 Farmers who refused 
 
 to provide information or stopped being members of the sample were replaced by 
 other farmers. 
 
 So the numbers of sample families in each village, as 
 
 well as the number of time-series (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) for each household, were not 
 necessarily 
 The 
 
 e&#126;ual. 
 
 vill&#126;ges 
 
 of Aurepalle, Shirapur and Kanzara were selected from the 
 
 districts of Mahbubnagar, sholapur and Akola, (match up each pair of items in order), and are located 
 about 70 km south, 336 km west nnd 550 km north of Hyderabad, 
 (match up each pair of items in order). 
 
 There were 3141 people in Aurepalle, 2017 people in shirapur 
 
 and 1380 people In Kanzara in 1985. 
 (large/relatively large) soil heterogeneIty is a (feature/ quality/ trait) of the SAT of India. 
 Aurepalle has medium and shallow alfisols (red soils) with low water 
 keeping/holding onto/remembering ability (to hold or do something). 
 
 Soil mixed-up nature is (in a surprising and interesting way) high in Aurepalle 
 
 7 
 
 compared to Shlr.apurand .Kanzara. 
 
 Shirapur has medIum and deep vertisols 
 
 (black soils) with high moist11re keeping/holding onto/remembering ability (to hold or do something)_ 
 
 Kanzara ha$ mainly 
 
 medlum-deeÂ·p black soils and shallow vertisols with .medium moisture keeping/holding onto/remembering 
 ability (to hold or do something). 
 
 Soils In Kanzara. are more (group of things that are all pretty much the same) than in Aurepalle and 
 
 Shirapur. 
 Rainfall in the SAT of India is generally weird In distribution and 
 the mean once-a-year rainfall ranges from about 400mm to 1200mm. 
 
 In the year's 
 
 1975 to 1985 the average once-a-year rainfall was 611mm f.or AUrepal.i.e, 629mm 
 for Shirapurand 850 mm for Kanzara. 
 
 Rainfall is very weird and uncertain 
 
 in Aurepalle and Shirapur. 
 Walker and Ryan (1990) report that dUI'ing .four years of the study perIod 
 Aurepalleand Shirapur had very 11 ttle rainfalL 
 higher and less (number or thing that changes) in Kanzara. 
 
 Rainfall is (compared to other things) 
 
 Farming is mostly dryland 
 
 with two main seasons, the rainy season (kharif) which spans the months Â·of 
 June to October followed by the after-ralny (rab!) season. 
 In Aurepaile. dryland crops include (grass grown for food), pearl millet, plgeonpea. 
 castor and high-cooperating with/producing/giving up variety (HYV) paddy. 
 
 (grass grown for food), pearl millet, 
 
 pigeonpea are intercropped, usually with one row of pigeonpea to four rows of 
 ."i, 
 
 cereal crops. 
 
 The high-cooperating with/producing/giving up variety paddy 1s mostly grown under 
 
 watered condltions. 
 
 Of the total cropped land, about 21 per cent is 
 
 watered in Aurepalle, compared to 9 per cent and 7 per cent in the villages 
 of Shlrapur and Kanzara, (match up each pair of items in order). 
 The rabi season has more reliable rainfall In the village of Shirapur. 
 DurIng the rabi season farmers grow mainly (grass grown for food) and chickpea. 
 and saf.flower are also grown. 
 other vegetables. 
 
 Local wheal 
 
 Crop-watering/rinsing with water is used for onions, chillies and 
 
 However, the use of high-cooperating with/producing/giving up varIeties Is very 
 
 limited in Shirapur. 
 
 8 
 
 The village of Kanzara has (compared to other things) good/willing. ra1nfall intllekharif 
 season and the crops grown include cotton.pigeonpea, combination (grass grown for food), local 
 sorghurn,groundnut. green gram and black gram. 
 planted in the rabi season. 
 in the other two villages. 
 
 Wheat and .chlckpeaare mainly 
 
 Intercropping is more .prevalent in Kanzara than 
 The use of improved technology, such as 
 
 high-yieldlng varieties .of (grass grown for food) and cotton. fertilIzers ClIld pestIcides, is 
 also high in Kanzara compared to the villages of Aurepalle and Shlrap\lr. 
 There exists a large difference/different version in the cropping patterns among the three 
 villages. 
 
 This difference/different version is related to differences in .s01l 
 
 heterogenelty,rainfall pattern and other factors between the villages. 
 Shirapur has the highest proportion of area cropped under cereals of whIch 
 lQcal (grass grown for food) adds/gives about 62 per cent of the total (helped to grow) land in 
 the village. 
 
 The area under cereals in Aurepalle and Kanzara is .about 50 and 
 
 30 per cent (match up each pair of items in order). 
 
 Oil crops play an important role in Aurepalle, 
 
 where castor adds/gives about 35 per cent of the total cropped land, 
 followed by (grass grown for food) and paddy which add/give about 20 per cent each. 
 Cotton Isa only crop in Kanzara. 
 
 It occupies about 40 per cent of the. 
 
 helped grow land in the village. 
 A sImilar difference/different version exists in the marketed output of crops in the three 
 villages. 
 
 The crops which have the largest proportion of marketed output are 
 
 castor in Aurepalle, cotton in Kanzara and flower in Shlrapur. 
 
 The cereal 
 
 crops, (grass grown for food), pearlmillet, paddy and wheat, ar.e mainly survival/income crops. 
 The labour .market includes growers and farming-based workers which 
 contain about two-thirds of the .actlve w.orkers in SAT India. 
 rnarket is active in the three villages. 
 
 The labour 
 
 However, the use of labour (family 
 
 and hired) differs/changes from village to village, as well as from year to year, 
 dependIng on rainfall, solI type, type of crop, crop-watering/rinsing with water, etc. 
 families heavily depend on hired labour to help grow their land. 
 
 Farm 
 In 
 
 9 
 
 AurepalleandKanzara, hired labour provIdes; the .maJority (60 to 80 per cent) 
 of the total labour used in crop productIon. 
 
 The high demand. f()rhired 
 
 labour Is due to ,the actIvities Â·of paddy transplantil1g in Aurepalle and 
 cotton pIcking in Kclnzara (see Walker and Ryan (1990) L 
 
 The labour force 
 
 contains men. women and children, but the last thing just mentioned only mak.ea very small 
 (thing that's given/work that's done). 
 
 The contrIbution of men to the. total family labour in crop 
 
 production Is a lot higher than women, while women rule the hired 
 labour ma.rke t. 
 In all the villages, (producing crops/helping something grow) such as plowing, terrible and 
 intercuituring is carried out using animal draft power, usually involving 
 little bulls. 
 
 However, many families which own small areas of land do not have 
 
 little bulls&#126; 
 
 Seasonal hiring Is common. especially by small farmers. 
 
 It Is 
 
 most common in Shirapur where little bull-to-Iand ratios are slgnlficantly lower 
 than in the other two vlllilges [Walker and Ryan (1990}). 
 
 Single little bull 
 
 owners often combine their little bulls and help grow on an exchange basis. 
 (material that makes plants grow better) is used almost entIrely for watered farming in the 
 study villages. 
 
 However. the use of (material that makes plants grow better) in dry land farming is 
 
 increasing in the rainfall-confident village of Kanzara and, a little bit, in 
 Aurepalle. 
 
 For example, the use of (material that makes plants grow better) in dryland farming has 
 
 increased from 3 per cent in 1975 ....76 to 50 per cent by 1985-86. 
 
 However, 
 
 application rates per hectare remained very low. 
 Poop/fertilizer plays an important role in the study villages. 
 apply poop/fertilizer to their land every year. 
 
 Manyfarmers 
 
 However, the supply of poop/fertilizer 1.s 
 
 held back by limited get/helpabilit:i ,.. f food which restricts animals 
 production as well as the use of its (something produced along with something else) f.or fuel. 
 Bug-killers are applied mainly in watered farming. although the 
 expense on (material that makes plants grow better)s is much higher (about nine times) than the 
 expense on bug-killers. 
 
 Bug-killers are widely applied 1n the villages of 
 
 10 
 Aurepalle and Kanzara. 
 The .following sectlon deals with the scientific analyses of the data 
 obtalnedfrom the three villages, Aurepalle, Shirapur and Kanzara. 
 
 It is 
 
 expected that different limit/guideline values and technicEl1 (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) are 
 likely because of the SUbstantial differences in the agro-(related to the Earth's weather) 
 (surrounding conditions) among the three villages.

 The Frontler Production Function 
 
 A (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area production function of Cobb-Douglas type, which 
 involves four basic explanatory varlables, is, at first, thought about/believed in this 
 study. The edge of something/unexplored area production function is defined by:

 The values of output (and input costs) were (lowered/flattened from losing air) using price indices 
 which were built from data on prices and amounts of valuable things 
 grown in the three villages.

 (changing from one form, state, or state of mind to another) rule that female an.1 child labour hours are equal to 0.75 
 and 0.50 male hours, (match up each pair of items in order). These factors are used by ICRISAT in 
 scientific analyses involving labour of different family memb&#126;rs.

 V1l and U1t are random (numbers that change/things that change) having the distributional properties, 
 as defined for equations (1) and (2). 
 The model, defined by equation (6), is created from the work of 
 Bardhan (1973), Deolalikar and Vijverberg (1983, 1987) and Batte$e, Coell! 
 and Colby (1989). 
 
 Bardhan (1973) thought about/believed a production function of 
 
 Cobb-Douglas type in which the (numbers that change/things that change), tot.al labour (family plus hired 
 labour hours) and the proportion of hired labour to total labour, were 
 separately included as explanatory (numbers that change/things that change). 
 
 Bardhan (1973) used Indian 
 
 farm-level data and decided that hired and family labour were 
 blended sometimes. 
 Deolalikar and Vijverberg (1983) defined a mOre 
 
 gen&#126;ral 
 
 type in the analysis of district-level data for Indian farms. 
 special cases of the CES model were carefully thought about/believed.

 unirrigated and watered land in theIr production function. 
 
 They ended/decided 
 
 that the best model had a weighted average of the unirrigated and watered 
 areas operated as the land (number or thing that changes). 
 Batt-ese, Coelli and Colby (1989) thought about/believed the model in which labour 
 and land (numbers that change/things that change) were the weIghted averages of their (pertaining to each person or thing) hired and 
 family labour and unirrigated and watered land.

 (1989) included cost of inputs in the Cobb-Douglas production function. 
 given input costs were positive. 
 
 However, if input costs were not 
 
 positive (as Is the case for a large proportion of farms In this study), then 
 input custs were not included in the function. 
 
 This dummy-changeable approach 
 
 may be criticised because as input cost approaches zero then productlon 
 should also approach zero according to the Cobb-Douglas productIon function. 
 The changed production function (6), in which costs of inputs enters 
 (more and more as time goes on), hints that as costs approach zero, the term, exp(Costs), 
 approaches one. not zero. 
 
 Hence, the model (6) hints that farms with 
 
 positive input costs have a different intercept value than those with Zero 
 input costs (of those which are measured), but the last thing just mentioned farms do not have 
 zero level of production. 
 The model of equation (6) is (using other choices) expressed by

 Scientific Results 
 A summary of the da.ta on the different varlables in thefrontler 
 
 production .function is given in Table 1. 
 
 It is obvious from these statistics 
 
 that Aurepalle farmers tend to be smaller in terms of value of output and 
 total land operated. 
 
 Kanzara farmer.s had the highest mean value of output, 
 
 human labour and little bull labour. 
 
 Kanzara farmers have the least amount of 
 
 crop-watering/rinsing with water because of the (compared to other things) confident rainfall. whereas Aurepalle 
 farmers have the greatest amount of crop-watering/rinsing with water because of the number of 
 growing paddy . 
 .Bullock labour is used much more in Kanzara and Aurepalle than 
 in Shlrapur. 
 
 Cost of inputs had a high proportion of zero (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) in. 
 
 all three villages and so the sample means were not very large in all three 
 cases. 
 The (random/including random data points) frontler productlon function (8) consists of ten 
 limits/guidelines, six beIng connected with the explanatory varIables of the 
 function and four being limits/guidelines whIch specify the distributions of the 
 random varIables, Vit. and U1t . 
 
 The maximum-lIkelIhood guesses for the 
 
 limits/guidelines of the edge of something/unexplored area production functions with time-invariant 
 limits/guidelines for the three villages are presented in Table 2. 
 Tests of guesses about the distribution of the random (numbers that change/things that change) 
 connected with the existence of technical inefficiency and leftover/extra error 
 are of interest. 
 
 The edge of something/unexplored area production function is equal to the

 So the null guesses that 
 
 1) 
 
 and 
 
 J.L 
 
 were zero, 
 
 ei ther individually or together., are of interest if the (random/including random data points)frontler 
 function is very different from the tradltional response function. 
 Tests of these different guesses connected with the limits/guidelines, '1, Il 
 and 11, are presented in Table 3. 
 
 The generalized chance-ratio test 
 
 statistic is calculated after received/got the logllkellhood value connected 
 with the restricted maximum-chance guesses for the special cases when 
 the appropriate limits/guidelines are zero. 
 The results presented in Table 3 suggest that, given the (detailed descriptions of exactly what is required) of 
 the (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area production function (8) with time-invariant 
 limits/guidelines, then the model is very different .from the usual 
 response function for all three villages. 
 
 Further, for farmers in Aurepalle 
 
 and Shirapur no sub-model in which the limits/guidelines, /land 11, are zero, either 
 individually or Both/together, is an (good) enough representation of the data. 
 
 That is, 
 
 technical inefficiency not only exists, but the farm effects are not time 
 $_$.nvariant. nor is the half-(usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) distribution an (good) enough repr.esentatlon. 
 However, for farmers in Kanzara, the null guess that the farm effects 
 ar(} time invariant and have half-(usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) distributions would be accepted 
 und(&#126;r 
 
 the model ideas (you think are true). 
 
 The above model for the (random/including random data points) front.ier production function 
 connected with panel data on sample farmers from the three villages is 
 likely to be inappropriate. 
 
 That is, the idea (you think is true) that the coefficients of 
 
 the explanatory (numbers that change/things that change) In the edge of something/unexplored area function (8) are time invariant, 
 but that the farm effects connected with technical inefficiency have a 
 particular time-different structure may be thought of as obnoxious.. 
 
 Hence we 
 
 now think about/believe a change of the model in which the coefficients of the 
 .explanator:, (numbers that change/things that change) In the edge of something/unexplored area productlon fUnction are time varying 
 and are, in .fact, a linear function of t.he year of (instance of watching, noticing, or making a statement).

 For this more general (detailed description of exactly what is required) of the (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area 
 production function, there would be interest in testing if the coefficients 
 of the production edge of something/unexplored area were time invariant. or the elasticities with 
 respect to the factor inputs were time invariant,after (asking lots of questions about/trying to find the truth about) whether 
 the farm effects were time invariant and/or the half-(usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) distribution was 
 a reasonable idea (you think is true). 
 The maximum-chance guesses for the limits/guidelines of the (random/including random data points) 
 edge of something/unexplored area model (9)-(10) with time-different limits/guidelines and time-changing/different farm 
 effects (2) are presented in Table 4. 
 
 Tests Â·of guesses about the 
 
 distribution of the farm effects connected with the (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area 
 production functions with time-varyIng coeffIcients are received/got from the 
 data in Table 5. 
 The statistics in Table 5 suggest the following ends/end results about the 
 technical inefficiencies .associated with farmers in the three villages: 
 (1) 
 
 Given the (detailed descriptions of exactly what is required) of the (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area production 
 
 function with time-different coefficients (9)-(10), the frontIer is not 
 very different from the usual response function for farmers In 
 Aurepalle. 
 
 Hence it could be decided that technical inefficiency Is not 
 
 obvious for Aurepallefarmers.

 For Shirapur farmers, the edge of something/unexplored area model is very different 
 
 from the usual response function, but the null guesses, that the 
 farm effects connected with technical inefficiency are time invariant and/or 
 have half-(usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) distribution, would be rejected. 
 (iii) 
 
 For Kanzara farmers, the null guess that the farm effects are 
 
 time invariant would be accepted by the data. 
 Given these ends/end results about the time-different nature of the farm 
 effects (when present) in the (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area production 'functions, 
 guesses as to whether the coefficients of the edges of something/unexplored areas 1.re time invariant 
 are carefully thought about/believed. 
 
 The (connected/related) test statistics are presented in Table 6. 
 
 From these results, it follows that the null guess that the coefficients 
 of the explanatory (numbers that change/things that change), other than year of (instance of watching, noticing, or making a statement), are time 
 invariant would be accepted at the one-percent level of importance for 
 Aurepalle farmers only. 
 Given the specificli.tions of the (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area production functions 
 wi th time-different limits/guidelines and technical effici.encies which are carefully thought about/believed 
 in this paper, the estimatect. limits/guidelines for the preferred edge of something/unexplored area models are 
 p&#126;&#126;esented 
 
 in Table 7. 
 
 Hence only farmers in Shirapur have time-changing/different 
 
 technical (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste), whereas farmers in Kanzara have time-invariant 
 technical (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste). 
 
 (statements about the future) for the similar technical 
 
 (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) for Shirapur and Kanzara farmers are presented in Tables 8 and 
 9, (match up each pair of items in order). 
 
 The technical (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) of Shirapur farmers in the first 
 
 year of (instance of watching, noticing, or making a statement) showed great (quality of changing over time or at different places) (from 0.191 to 0.898) but 
 increased over the ten-year period to as high as 0.985. 
 
 However, the Kanzara 
 
 farmers had constant technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) over time which varied from 0.445 
 to 0.817. In both cases, the level of technical inefflciencyof th 
 involved was (large/relatively large) for most farmers.

 A stated in the discussion of the front!er production function with 
 time-invariant coefficients of the explanatory varIables, defIned by equation 
 (8), 1f family and hired labour were equally productive, then the limit/guideline, 
 b2 ,woUld have value 1.0 and so the coefficients of the labour-ratio 
 (number or thing that changes), HLit../Labour It t and its interaction with year of (instance of watching, noticing, or making a statement) would 
 be zero in the production frontIer wIth time-different coefficients of the 
 explanatory (numbers that change/things that change). 
 
 Teststatlstlcs .for the null 
 
 hypothes&#126;s 
 
 of equal 
 
 proQuctivlty of family and hired labour are presented in Table 10, given the 
 speclfications of the pr.eferred frontIer productIon functions for the three 
 villages, reported in Table 1. 
 
 These statistlcs suggest that the guess of 
 
 equal working well of family and hired labour would be rejected for the 
 villages of Aurepal1e and Shlrapur. but 
 
 accept&#126;d 
 
 for the village of Kanzara. 
 
 It is noted that the coefficlent of the logarithm of Little bull labour in 
 the preferred production edges of something/unexplored areas have negative values for all three 
 villages, but the coefficient is very different from zero in 
 Aurepalle only. 
 
 Negative elasticities of little bull labour have been found in 
 
 other studies [e .. g., Saini (1979), Battese, Coell! and Colby (1989) and

 Ends/end results 
 Our application of edge of something/unexplored area ,production functions. in the analysis of 
 
 panel data from three Indian villages has pointed to/showed some important 
 findings: 
 (1) 
 
 When the data are' analysed using a edge of something/unexplored area model with coefficients 
 
 that are constant over time (including the intercept limit/guideline), then 
 technical inefficiencies are found to .be highly significant in all three 
 villages and to be time varyIllg in two of the three villages; 
 (li) 
 
 If the .frontier production function contains time-changing/different 
 
 coefficients (intercept andela\,ticities) then different ends/end results about 
 technical inefficiency were obtalned in the different villages. 
 
 In 
 
 Aurepalle. the edge of something/unexplored area function was not significantly diff.erent from the 
 traditional response function (which can be guessed (in a way that produces a lot with very little waste) pyordinary 
 least-squares moving backward). 
 
 In Kanzara technical inefficiency was not 
 
 Very different over time. 
 
 However. in Shirapur it could not be 
 
 decided that technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) ",'as tl.me invariant for the farmers 
 involved. 
 (iIi) 
 
 The hypotheSis that the coefficients of the explanatory (numbers that change/things that change) 
 
 (other than the (stopping or interfering with something)) w.ere time invariant was rejected for two of the 
 three villages. 
 The above results point to/show that the inclusi.on of year-of-(instance of watching, noticing, or making a statement)as 
 an explanatory (number or thing that changes) In the edge of something/unexplored area model to account for neutral 
 (related to computers and science) change, as long as it is appropriate, does not necessarily 
 mean that technical inefficiency wIll be found to be removed from the data. 
 Our analysis of the farm-level data from the three vlliages has not 
 went ahead to the point of being able to explain or permit the different 
 results which have been obtaIned for the three villages. 
 (acts of asking questions and trying to find the truth about something) are needed/demanded to deal with such issues.

 The applica.tion of the edge of something/unexplored area production function models thought about/believed in 
 this paper has not included the possIble effect of farm-or farmer-specific 
 varIables. such as .education of the farmer, access to credIt. etc. 
 
 Further 
 
 analyses incorporating such (numbers that change/things that change) In the edge of something/unexplored area models is being 
 begun/tried. 
 The scientific application of (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area production functions 
 for the analysis of panel data needs/demands that the pre-decided part of 
 the 
 
 fun&#126;&#126;tions 
 
 be appropriately modelled, in addl ti.on to the (random/including random data points) 
 
 elements connected with technical inefficiency and random error. 
 obvlously a challenging exercise.
