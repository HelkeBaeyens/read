 Abstract 
 
 This paper uses a flexible (translog) production function to guess (wasting very little while working or producing something) of 227 farms from West Bengal, 
 India. We think about/believe guess of technical and allocative inefficiencies using a (money made/good thing received) making the most of (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) which 
 changes something (to helps someone)/takes care of someone both endogenous and (coming from the outside of something) inputs. The maximum chance method of guess developed in 
 this paper is based on the production function and the first-order conditions of profit (biggest increase/best possible extent). Farm-specific 
 technical and allocative inefficiencies are also guessed. Scientific results show that the mean level of technical 
 (wasting very little while working or producing something) is 75.46% while the best farm is 85.87% (producing a lot with very little waste) (technically). So far as allocative (wasting very little while working or producing something) is concerned 
 most of the farms are found to be under-users of the endogenous inputs, that is,, fertiliser, poop/fertilizer, human and 
 little bull labour. 
 
 1. Introduction 
 
 The neoclassical explanation of production is based 
 on the idea of (wasting very little while working or producing something). This idea is focused in the textbook definition of a production 
 function which gives the maximum possible output for given amounts of inputs. One problem 
 with the idea of 'maximum' is that nobody can 
 recognise it simply by watching/ noticing/ celebrating/ obeying the actual level 
 of output unless the watched/followed output is assumed 
 to be the highest value. Such an idea (you think is true) is not 
 realistic since different producers do produce different levels of output even if they use the same 
 level of every watched/followed input. One way of explaining the difference in watched/followed outputs among 
 producers is through differences in productive 
 (wasting very little while working or producing something). In the edge of something/unexplored area approach a producer is 
 
 said to be technically (producing a lot with very little waste) 1 if the watched/followed 
 output is highest value, given the input amounts. 
 So, the production edge of something/unexplored area is defined as the 
 center  of maximum possible outputs for each level 
 of input use. A failure on the part of the farm to 
 produce the edge of something/unexplored area level of output, given the 
 input amounts, is attributed to technical inefficiency. 
 
 1 The idea  of technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) goes back to Farrell 
 (1957). Another idea  of (wasting very little while working or producing something) is Leibenstien's X-(wasting very little while working or producing something) (1966), which is often connected with poor quality or 
 poorly trained/motivated labour force, lack of managerial 
 effort, etc. In the big picture  of farming, soil (features/ qualities/ traits), 
 (related to the Earth's weather) and some (related to how much money and power people have) factors may affect (wasting very little while working or producing something) of a farm.

 Technical inefficiency is not the only inefficiency. If the producer makes mistakes in setting apart inputs, the resulting inefficiency is labeled as 
 allocative inefficiency. It is always connected with 
 some behavioral goal like profit (biggest increase/best possible extent) or cost minimisation. Mistakes in the portion of useful things/valuable supplies and production of (less-than-best) 
 level of output increase cost and, therefore, decrease (money made/good thing received). As a result, identification of the 
 inefficient producers is very important, especially 
 for government policy designed to (help increase/show in a good way) (producing a lot with very little waste) use of useful things/valuable supplies. 
 Econometric guess of edge of something/unexplored area functions 
 goes back to Aigner, Lovell and Schmidt (1977) 
 and Meeiisen and van den Broeck (1977). The 
 way(s) of doing things proposed by these authors is quite 
 general and can change something (to help someone)/take care of someone any functional 
 form of the hidden (under) production technology. 
 However, their approach is restricted to guess of only technical inefficiency or cost therefrom. Extensions of the Aigner et al. (1977) model 
 to includes both technical and allocative inefficiencies have been made in terms of production 
 functions for which the cost or the profit functions can be received/made from clearly from the optimising 
 conditions (see, for example, Schmidt and Lovell, 
 1979, 1980; Kumbhakar, 1987, 1988). The major 
 advantage of using such (serving to severely limit or control) production 
 functions lies in getting closed form math-related 
 formulae for costs of technical and allocative 
 inefficiencies which are of first (or most important) concern to the 
 producers. The disadvantage is that the production functions for which cost or profit functions 
 can be received/made from clearly are quite (serving to severely limit or control) in 
 nature. 
 This paper describes a method of guessing 
 technical and allocative inefficiencies using a 
 translog production function - the most widely 
 used flexible functional form in applied works. 
 Guessing a translog production function with 
 inefficiency was first proposed by Greene (1980). 
 He assumed, at least completely/in a hinting way, the inputs to be 
 (coming from the outside of something) or pre-planned. The problem with 
 such an idea (you think is true) is that allocative inefficiency 
 from (less-than-best) input use cannot arise since the 
 use of input levels are no longer a choice (number or thing that changes). 
 In this paper, we leave from the Greene 
 
 creation by including endogenous and (coming from the outside of something) inputs. The endogenous inputs are chosen 
 to (make as big as possible) expected value of (money made/good thing received). Since the 
 input demand and output supply functions cannot 
 be received/made from clearly, the limits/guidelines are guessed from the system of equations consisting of 
 the production function and the first-order conditions of expected profit (biggest increase/best possible extent) using the 
 Maximum Chance (ML) method. Guess 
 of technical and allocative inefficiencies for each 
 (instance of watching, noticing, or making a statement) is also thought about/believed. The proposed 
 method is applied to guess (wasting very little while working or producing something) of 227 
 farms in West Bengal, India. 
 Organisation of the rest of the paper is as 
 follows. Section 2 gives an summary of (wasting very little while working or producing something) 
 studies in Indian farming. This is followed by 
 the econometric model. Section 4 describes the 
 data and the results are reported in Section 5. 
 End/end result and statements are in Section 6. 
 
 2. (wasting very little while working or producing something) measures in Indian farming 
 
 Previous studies on (wasting very little while working or producing something) of Indian farms 
 can be classified broadly into the following three 
 categories. First, studies based on the emotional  approach where the limits/guidelines were directly guessed mostly by using the ordinary least squares 
 (OLS) method. These limit/guideline guesses were 
 then used to check whether the first order conditions of profit (biggest increase/best possible extent) are happy (see, for 
 example, Hopper, 1965; Sahota, 1968; Saini, 
 1979). Attempts were also made to model these 
 mistakes in terms of (capable of being seen and known) factors like education, experience, etc. (Ram, 1980). In the second category of studies, (money made/good thing received) making the most of behavior was clearly taken into account by guessing 
 the dual profit function. Again (wasting very little while working or producing something) was 
 modeled as a function of farm (features/ qualities/ traits) like 
 size of land holding (Lau and Yotopoulos, 1971; 
 Yotopoulos and Lau, 1973), size and form of 
 (living somewhere) (Junankar, 1980), variety of crops, and 
 the degree of mechanisation (Sidhu, 1974). Finally, over the last few years the edge of something/unexplored area way(s) of doing things of 
 Aigner et al. (1977) was used by Huang and Bagi 
 (1984), Huang (1984) and Kalirajan and Shand 
 (1985), among others. 
 
 S.C. Kumbhakar /Agricultural Money flow 10 (1994) 143-152 
 
 The present study follows the last approach, 
 (in other words), it uses the (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area method to 
 guess money-based (wasting very little while working or producing something) of farms in West 
 Bengal, India. We extend the results of previous 
 studies by incorporating allocative inefficiency together with technical inefficiency in a translog 
 production function. This extension has two major advantages. First, in contrast to the previous 
 edge of something/unexplored area studies, we do not assume all inputs to be 
 (coming from the outside of something) or pre-planned. Instead, we include 
 both (coming from the outside of something) and endogenous inputs in our 
 analysis. More than that, the idea (you think is true) that the endogenous inputs are independent of technical 
 inefficiency is not made. Second, we use a system 
 of (happening together) equations to avoid possible bias 
 that might arise due to the presence of the endogenous inputs and their relationships with technical inefficiency. 2 By including the first-order 
 conditions of profit (biggest increase/best possible extent) in the guess process we hope to get (producing more with less waste) limit/guideline guesses. 
 
 3. Econometric model 
 It is well known that the production technology can be guessed by either the emotional (direct) 
 or the dual (indirect) approach. In the dual approach, one starts with a (money made/good thing received) or cost function 
 which can be directly guessed. Added/more information can be gotten by using HotellingShephard's lemma. 3 In this paper we use the 
 emotional  approach where guess of the produc- 
 
 One can also avoid the endogeneity problem by guessing a 
 profit function. Since the input and output prices are (coming from the outside of something), consistent estimator of the limits/guidelines is received/got using 
 a single-equation way of doing things. There are, however, two problems connected with guessing a profit function. First, guess of profit function needs/demands price (quality of changing over time or at different places) which might 
 be a problem in a thin sliceal data (see, e.g., Junankar, 
 1989). Second, separating costs of technical and allocative 
 inefficiencies (in terms of previous/unavoidable (money made/good thing received)) from a profit function is not always possible. Since our goal is to guess 
 both technical and allocative inefficiencies, we decided not to 
 chase after the profit function approach in this study. 
 3 Application of some of these models can be found in 
 Cowing et al. (1983), Kopp and Diewert (1982) and Greene 
 (1980). See also Schmidt (1985) for a opinion of this approach.

 tion function is the main center. Added/more equations from the first-order conditions of profit 
 (biggest increase/best possible extent) are also used to make the model 
 consistent in terms of the number of endogenous 
 (numbers that change/things that change) being equal to the number of equations. 
 The production function is assumed to be represented by a translog form, which with both endogenous and (coming from the outside of something) inputs is written as: 
 In Y=a 0 +a' In X+8' In Z+t In X'B In X 
 +tlnZ'AlnZ 
 + In 
 
 X'&#126; 
 
 In Z + 
 
 T 
 
 +v 
 
 ( 1) 
 
 where Y is output, X and Z are n X 1 and m X 1 
 vectors of endogenous and almost-fixed inputs, (match up each pair of items in order). The B and A matrices are square 
 (n X n and m X m, (match up each pair of items in order)) and matching 
 whereas the &#126; matrix is of order n X m. These 
 matrices contain all second-order coefficients. 
 The first-order coefficients are contained in a 
 and 8 vectors. The symbol v represents a random 
 disturbance that takes by force/takes control of (coming from the outside of something) shocks to 
 the producer. Since these shocks can both be 
 good/willing and bad/unhelpful, v is allowed to take 
 positive and negative values. On the other hand, 
 technical inefficiency, T, is represented by a nonpositive random changeable; T = 0 defines the production edge of something/unexplored area which gives the maximum possible output given X and Z. The edge of something/unexplored area is 
 (random/including random data points) because of the presence of v. A nonzero value of T can be understood/explained as the reduction in log output due to technical inefficiency. 
 Therefore, given the inputs X and Z, the watched/followed differences in output levels can be attributed to either technical inefficiency or random shocks or both. (in almost the same way), the watched/followed differences in (endogenous) input use, even if input 
 prices are the same for all farms, can be explained in terms of differences in almost-fixed inputs, and the presence of technical and allocative 
 inefficiencies (defined in Eq. 2 below). 
 Since the inputs X are endogenous, we have 
 to introduce added/more equations for consistency 
 of the model. These equations are received/got from 
 the optimising behavior of the producer. We assume that the goal of the producer is to 
 (make as big as possible) (money made/good thing received) ((may or may not happen, depending on something) on its technical inefficiency) subject to the production function in (1).

 In getting/taking the necessary conditions of profit 
 (biggest increase/best possible extent) (given technical inefficiency, T) we 
 assume that the effect of (coming from the outside of something) shocks v is 
 unknown. 
 Since (money made/good thing received) is random because v is 
 unknown, we follow expected profit (biggest increase/best possible extent) 
 judging requirement due to Zellner, Kmenta and Dreze 
 (1966). The first-order conditions of expected 
 profit (biggest increase/best possible extent) can be written as: 
 
 W; 
 
 aE(Y) 
 
 ax 
 
 (2) 
 
 = pexp( -u;) 
 
 I 
 
 where P is the output price and W; is the price of 
 input i; ui is understood/explained as allocative inefficiency 
 in the use of input i (Kumbhakar, 1987). If ui &amp;gt; 0 
 ( &amp;lt; 0), the ith input is used more (less) than its 
 best level, given W; and P. In other words, 
 any moving away of the value of not important product of 
 an input from its price is attributed to errors in 
 the portion of input (allocative inefficiency). 4

 Where Ef = Tf + Vf, YJj = ljf + t Tf, ljf =

 ideas (you think are true) on Tf, Uf and vf. (The subscript f 
 represents farms, f = 1, 2, ... , F.) These are: 
 - U is multivariate (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) with zero mean and 
 constant covariance I, and it is distributed 
 independently and identically over farms. 
 - v is i.i.d. N(O, a}). 
 - The distribution of T is the non-positive part of/amount of an i.i.d. N(O, a/) (number or thing that changes). 
 - v and T are independent of each other and are 
 are also independent of the elements of the U

 Eqs. (1) and (3) make up/be equal to a system of (n + 1)

 these equations are highly (not going in a straight line), closed-form 
 solution of In Y and In Xi, (in other words), output supply and 
 input demand functions, cannot be gotten. 
 However, consistent estimators of the limits/guidelines 
 can be gotten from the ML method without 
 getting/taking the input demand and output supply 
 functions clearly. What's more, estimators of T 
 and ui can also be gotten for each (instance of watching, noticing, or making a statement). 
 
 One can separate input-specific allocative inefficiency (u;l 
 from random errors in optimisation if panel data are available

 4. Data 
 
 The data set used in the present study has 
 been collected by the Agro-Money-based Research 
 Centre 6 from three areas of the Indian state of 
 West Bengal. These areas cover the whole 
 paddy production belt of West Bengal. A crosssection random sample of 227 household farms 
 has been selected for the present study. The 
 survey was managed and did/done during 1980-1985. Since 
 different areas were surveyed in different years, 
 it is not a panel. Over the last twenty years, the

 coming of (related to computers and science) changes, introduction of 
 high cooperating with/producing/giving up seeds, security of land (length of time at work or in power/right to permanent employment), availability of production loans, relaxation of government control over (instance of buying something for money) of output and sale of 
 some important  factors (fertilisers, crop-watering/rinsing with water water, 
 bug-killers), etc., have made the farming-based production system very much market oriented. Under such an (surrounding conditions), use of the profit (biggest increase/best possible extent) guess on the part of the producers 
 as a maintained guess seems appropriate. 
 The farming-based production activities of the 
 state of West Bengal are spread over at least two 
 crop seasons. Here we think about/believe the bad rainstorm 
 paddy as our subject of (act of asking questions and trying to find the truth about something). 7 This choice 
 is because bad rainstorm paddy is produced by all farms in the area under (act of asking questions and trying to find the truth about something). More than that, during this season, markets for 
 the inputs become quite competitive. 
 Output (Y) is measured in quintals (100 kg) of 
 paddy. The endogenous inputs are: fertiliser (F), 
 poop/fertilizer (M), human labour (N) and little bull labour 
 (B). We treat land (L) and capital (K) as quasifixed inputs. The human labour includes both 
 family labour and hired labour and is measured 
 in hours. Little bull labour is also measured in hours. 
 Fertiliser and poop/fertilizer are measured in kg. Land 
 is measured in areas of land. Prices of paddy, fertiliser, 
 poop/fertilizer, labour and little bull labour are all measured in Indian rupees. 
 The capital (number or thing that changes) used here is a weighted 
 average of rental value of services from crop-watering/rinsing with water 
 and other farm equipment. The land under (producing crops/helping something grow) has been used as a almost-fixed input because its market is not well developed especially 
 in leasing out. It is measured in areas of land and it 
 includes the area under bad rainstorm paddy only. 
 Working well differences due to different types 
 of soil, land, weather and land sizes are controlled by including (related to a large area) and farm-size dummy 
 (numbers that change/things that change) in the production function. We hope 
 that these (related to a large area) dummies will (record by a camera or computer) the differential effects of soil, land and weather since 
 we do not have data on these (numbers that change/things that change). 
 
 7 Data on input usage are related to the production of paddy 
 only. Inputs used other than in paddy are not thought about/believed 
 here.

 data point. 
 The production function is said to be well 
 behaved if it is monotonically increasing and curved in input amounts. Monotonicity is happy 
 since the guessed input cost shares (cost of 
 input as a ratio of total value of output) are 
 found to be positive. Curviness is checked by 
 (checking for truth/proving true) the negative semidefiniteness of the matrix:

 where W= diag (W1, ... , Wn), S = diag (S 1, ... ,

 Technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) for each farm is calculated 
 as TE = Y /Ymax = exp( T ), where the guess of T 
 is received/got from (6). This measure of technical 
 (wasting very little while working or producing something) is called output increasing since it 
 hints that actual output is below the edge of something/unexplored area 
 output by [1 - exp( T )]_) X 100%. Or, output could be increased by [1 - exp( T )]_) X 100% if 
 the farm becomes technically (producing a lot with very little waste). The frequency distribution of TE is reported in Table 2. 
 None of the farms in the sample is fully technically (producing a lot with very little waste). The mean (wasting very little while working or producing something) of these farms 
 is 75.46%; the maximum is 85.87% and the smallest 55.45%. So, possible output of these 
 farms, given their input usage, is much higher.

 From the view point of a useful thing/valuable supply rare/not enough  (process of people making, selling, and buying things) these findings have obvious policy hint/result/effect. By improving technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) of these 
 farms, output could be increased, on average, by 
 24.54%. 8 
 In Table 3 we report the level of technical 
 (wasting very little while working or producing something) by area and farm size. To conserve 
 space only the mean, maximum and minimum 
 values are included. The mean (wasting very little while working or producing something) levels 
 are very almost the same  across areas and size groups 
 but not the minimum values. This difference in 
 the distribution of technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) is also reflected in the standard mistakes (reported in the 
 last column of Table 3). It can be seen that the 
 small farms are (producing more with less waste) (higher mean values and smaller standard mistakes). However, 
 the best farm in the small size group is not more 
 (producing a lot with very little waste) than those in the medium and large size 
 groups. 
 Readers familiar with the scientific applications of (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area production functions 
 
 Two different models, that is,, a single-equation translog 
 model and a (happening together) equation Cobb-Douglas (CD) 
 model, were also thought about/believed. About 90% of the limits/guidelines 
 were found to be (related to numbers) unimportant in the first model. 
 Because of this we did not chase after the single-equation translog 
 model further. The CD model is a special case of the translog 
 model thought about/believed in this study. We, therefore, test the restricÂ· 
 tions for the CD model using the chance ratio test. The 
 test rejects the CD (detailed description of exactly what is required) at the 1% level of signifiÂ· 
 cance. The distribution of technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) created from 
 this model shows much greater (quality of changing over time or at different places) - ranging from 20% 
 to 87% with a mean value of 67.13%. Since this model is 
 rejected by the data, we decided not to report the results in 
 details.

 are not surprised by the above results on technical (wasting very little while working or producing something). The mean level of technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) is just like other almost the same  studies. 9 
 There are, however, certain factors which can 
 affect the guess of technical (wasting very little while working or producing something). First, 
 since we are dealing with cross sectional data, 
 farm-clearly stated/particular factors cannot be controlled. So, 
 unseen farm effects are confused with 
 technical (wasting very little while working or producing something). As a result, farms which are 
 found to be most inefficient might not be so if 
 individual effects are controlled. This can be done 
 only when panel data are available [see, for example, Kumbhakar and Hjalmarsson (1993) for such 
 an application]. Second, the role of non-physical 
 inputs like experience, information, supervision, 
 etc., might influence the ability of a producer to 
 use the available technology (in a way that produces a lot with very little waste). These 
 factors are not taken into account because of 
 non-availability of such information in the present data. 
 To compose a management index that describes how management is reflected in the level 
 of input use, we run an extra/helping (thing) moving backward 
 of technical (wasting very little while working or producing something), which can be used as an 
 index of 'management', on all of the inputs. 10 
 The results show positive relationship between 
 technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) and (endogenous) input use. 
 In other words, an inefficient farm tends to use 
 less of every (endogenous) input and produce less 
 output (Kumbhakar, 1987). This finding suggests 
 that: 
 - The OLS results based on the production function without the management (number or thing that changes) are (created unfair thinking in)/(unfair-thinking). 
 - Even if technical inefficiency is introduced into 
 the analysis [as in Huang and Bagi (1984), 
 Huang (1984), Kalirajan and Shand (1985), 
 among others], the idea (you think is true) that technical 
 inefficiency is independent of the inputs is 
 inappropriate. As a result, the limit/guideline 
 guesses are (not agreeing/not happening in the same way) if the production 
 function alone is used in guess. 
 See the survey by Battese (1992) and the references referred to 
 there for a variety of applications in farming-based money flow/money-based studies 
 using data from different countries. 
 10 This moving backward "does not explain what decides/figures out the 
 performance of the management" (see Mundlak, 1961, p. 49).

 In view of the 'belief' that there is an inverse 
 relation between land size and working well in 
 Indian farming, we looked at the coefficient of 
 the land (number or thing that changes) in the extra/helping (thing) moving backward. The 
 coefficient is negative and (meaningful numbers). 
 This finding supports previous results that small 
 farms are technically (producing more with less waste). 11 
 Now we examine whether these farms are using their inputs (in a way that produces a lot with very little waste) by calculating allocative inefficiency for each farm from (3), that is,

 where Y *, S * and a}, T are to be replaced by 
 their guesses. A zero value of u; means that the 
 input i is (in a way that produces a lot with very little waste) used whereas a negative 
 (positive) value means under-use (overutilisation). 12 In view of this, we separate positive and negative values of u for each input and 
 report their mean values in Table 4. The distribution of farms is shown by their percentages in 
 each category. Table 4 shows a clear pattern of 
 input use. Under-use of the inputs is a 
 common problem to most of these farms: 53.75% 
 underutilised fertiliser and 62.56% underutilised 
 poop/fertilizer. The percentage of farms underutilising 
 human and little bull labour are 57.71 and 55.95, 
 (match up each pair of items in order). 
 These results on allocative inefficiency seem to 
 argue the Schultz guess (1964) that Indian farms are poor but allocatively (producing a lot with very little waste). 
 Schultz, like Hopper (1965), calculated allocative 
 (in)(wasting very little while working or producing something) for the whole sample, not for individual farms. So, to relate our results to those 
 of Schultz, one has to look at the mean values of 
 u; which are very close to zero. This is what 
 Schultz's end/end result is. So, overall 
 
 11 See Saini (1979, chapter 7) for a review of some of these 
 studies. It is, however, to be noted that the present way(s) of doing things is econometrically much more fancy (or smart) and difficult/strict/high quality. 
 12 It is to be noted that the idea of allocative (wasting very little while working or producing something) used 
 here is based on the profit (biggest increase/best possible extent) guess. Since the 
 (money made/good thing received) making the most of behavior is embedded into the model, it is 
 not possible to test the profit (biggest increase/best possible extent) guess as such 
 (Junankar, 1980). 
 
 level our results do not argue the Schultz 
 guess. 
 However, it is to be noted that the idea  of 
 (wasting very little while working or producing something) is mostly micro. One cannot draw 
 any end/end result (related to/looking at/thinking about) allocative (wasting very little while working or producing something) of 
 individual farms from the groups. Our results 
 on allocative inefficiency are based on individual 
 farms. In reporting these results we grouped farms 
 as under- (over-)user of inputs and calculated 
 their mean values. What is interesting here is that 
 one can look at the importance of these values for 
 each input and farm to identify those which are 
 under- or over-user of a particular input. The 
 aggregative picture hides such information. 
 From a policy point of view, the main advantage 
 of this type of micro analysis is that it gives some 
 information about the inefficient farms to the 
 policy makers so that outside help of experts may 
 be directed to those who need it most. 
 The guesses of allocative inefficiency, presented here, are subject to two warnings. First, the 
 use of the risk neutral idea (you think is true) where farms 
 are risk disliking may result in 'apparent allocative 
 inefficiency'. The present study completely/in a hinting way assumes 
 risk neutral behavior while using the expected 
 profit (biggest increase/best possible extent) behavior where only the output (number or thing that changes) is uncertain. Under risk disliking behavior the first order condition is: 
 (British pounds) ( U 1 ( 7T) [_( p 
 
 :;i - &#126;]) 
 
 = 
 
 (11) 
 
 0 
 
 where U( 7T) is utility from (money made/good thing received), 7T, and U 
 is 
 the first almost the same as U( Â· ). The second derivative 
 of U( Â· ), U( Â· )", is assumed to be negative (zero) 
 for (not wanting to do anything dangerous) (risk-neutral) behavior. So, the 
 1 
 
 ( Â·) 
 
 S.C. Kumbhakar /Agricultural Money flow 10 (1994) 143-152 
 
 condition under risk neutrality [U"( Â·) = 0 or 
 U'( Â·)=constant] is: 
 E ( [_( P :;; - 
 
 &#126;]) 
 
 = 
 
 0 
 
 (12) 
 
 which is the first-order condition of expected 
 profit (biggest increase/best possible extent) in (3) without allocative inefficiency (u; = 0). Since the solution of X; from 
 (11) is less than that of X; from (12), the guesses of input over-use will be (created unfair thinking in)/(unfair-thinking) upward if risk-neutral behavior is (forced (on people)/caused an inconvenient situation) when 
 producers are (not wanting to do anything dangerous). Second, the output and 
 input markets may not be competitive as assumed. In the Indian big picture  one may refer to  government helping action in the input markets, e.g., 
 fertiliser and labour markets as well as in the 
 output market. The presence of such restrictions 
 twists/lies about prices which may result in 'apparent allocative inefficiency'. 
 
 6. End/end result and statements 
 
 The main (thing that's given/work that's done) of this paper is in the 
 use of a flexible (translog) production function in 
 guessing technical and allocative (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste) using farm-level data from West Bengal, India. We 
 used the expected profit (biggest increase/best possible extent) judging requirement 
 which changes something (to helps someone)/takes care of someone both endogenous and (coming from the outside of something) (almost-fixed) inputs and guessed both 
 technical and allocative inefficiencies for each 
 farm. The possibility of bias or (unexpected difference, missing thing, or mistake) in 
 limit/guideline guesses resulting from relationship of 
 technical inefficiency and input use is eliminated 
 by using a (happening together) equation approach instead of a single equation method. 
 The scientific results show that there is big scope for improving technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) 
 of these farms. None of the farms in our sample 
 is fully technically (producing a lot with very little waste). The (producing the most with the least waste) 
 farm is about 14% below the production edge of something/unexplored area. 
 We also find that technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) is positively 
 related to fertiliser, poop/fertilizer, labour and little bull labour but negatively with land size. The last 
 result shows that small farms are (producing more with less waste) 
 (technically). This finding is important so far as 
 the land reform policy of the government is con- 
 
 !51 
 
 cerned. Concerning allocative inefficiency, we find 
 that more than 50% of the farms in our sample 
 under-use fertiliser, poop/fertilizer, labour and little bull labour. The extent of under-use, however, 
 differs/changes from farm to farm. This thing/event of 
 inefficient use of inputs may be due to distortions 
 in the input and output markets resulting from 
 government rules as well as social and cultural restrictions. (not totally pure/not totally correct) market conditions 
 may also be responsible for this misallocation. 
 The present research can be extended in a few ways. First, factors like land size, land (length of time at work or in power/right to permanent employment), 
 credit availability, education, extension services, 
 etc., may be introduced to explain differences in 
 technical and allocative (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste). Second, if 
 the product and factor markets are not competitive because of government rules, social 
 and cultural (blocking things), etc., or some of the factors 
 are not moving and farms are risk disliking, (something forced on people/an inconvenient situation) of the expected profit (biggest increase/best possible extent) (risk 
 neutrality) guess may lead to wrong ends/end results, especially (related to/looking at/thinking about) allocative inefficiency. Finally, availability of panel data would be 
 helpful to control for farm-clearly stated/particular effects which 
 cannot be separated from technical inefficiency 
 using cross sectional data. We hope to face/deal with 
 some of these issues in the future.
