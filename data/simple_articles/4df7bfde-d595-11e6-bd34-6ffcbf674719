 ABSTRACT 
 Brandao, A. and Martin, W.J., 1993. Effects/results/suggestions of farming-based trade (easing government rules) for the 
 developing countries. Agric. Econ., 8: 313-343. 
 The developing countries as a group could expect to experience only small welfare gains 
 if they chose not to actively participate in farming-based trade (easing government rules) and relied only 
 on the benefits of partial (easing government rules) in the OECD countries. Participation along the lines 
 of the Dunkel package, with the developing countries reducing positive help by less 
 than the developed countries, would produce gains of the order of US $20 billion. More 
 complete participation in trade (easing government rules) involving reductions of both positive and 
 negative protection would almost triple these welfare gains. While some developing countries do not gain from trade (easing government rules) even with full participation, the number of such 
 countries and the importance of their losses are greatly reduced. 
 
 1. INTRODUCTION 
 
 The Uruguay Round has been the most complex of the eight rounds of 
 many-sided (back-and-forth conversations to agree on something) among the contracting parties to the General 
 Agreement on Taxes/import taxes and Trade (GATT). With taxes/import taxes on most manufactured products (that are bought and sold)  already reduced to low levels in developed countries, issues 
 put aside in earlier rounds have been brought to the frontfront of the 
 discussions. Farming has assumed an important in the process and the 
 end of/final opinion of the round has been delayed a few times mostly because 
 of (problems, delays, etc.) in reaching an agreement on farming.

 Big progress towards an agreement on farming has been 
 made. The U.S. and the Cairns group have drawn back from their initial 
 bold proposals for complete elimination of payments and the EC has 
 proposed to begin/try significant changes of its own farming (Andrews, 
 Roberts and Love, 1992). However, a big differences on the approach 
 to reform, on (change to make better/related to changing something) of border measures, domestic support and market 
 access, mainly (but not (in a way unlike anything else)) between the U.S. and the EC positions, 
 needed/demanded huge (workingto reach agreement/getting through) effort. 
 The (when something is kept out or not included) of farming from previous GATT rounds has meant that 
 national farming-based policies have been mostly outside the fields of study 
 (forced (on people)/caused an inconvenient situation) on other. traded products (that are bought and sold). The resulting situation has been well 
 described as one of 'disarray' in which lots of distortionary policies 
 have been applied: sometimes to raise domestic prices relative to world 
 prices; sometimes to lower domestic prices; and often to insulate 
 domestic prices from movements in world prices. Much of this helping action 
 has (in the end) been (harmful to yourself), with the combined effects of national 
 policies designed to raise and (make steady/make firm and strong) domestic prices being to depress and 
 destablize the world prices to which almost all domestic prices are linked 
 in the long run (Mundlak and Larson, 1992). In developing countries, in 
 particular, the farming-based part/area is also usually weighed down with indirect 
 taxes charged through protection to the manufacturing and services parts/areas. There is increasing knowledge that the costs of policies in developing 
 countries are usually greater than they first appear (Krueger, Schiff and 
 Valdes, 1988, 1991). 
 Increasing knowledge of the disagreeing worldwide  effects of independent 
 national policies and of their full costs has added/has given towards a desire for 
 reform of which including farming in the Uruguay Round is one 
 sign. Another important type of reform has been happening at the 
 national level, with many countries moving towards reform of their farming-based policies to reduce the money-related or social costs. Some (easing government rules) is 
 also happening through the (creation and construction/ group of objects) of (related to a large area) trading groups of countries such as the 
 North American Free Trade Agreement. Another, more basic type 
 of reform is happening in the earlier centrally planned (processes of people making, selling, and buying things) whose 
 farming-based parts/areas are being totally rebuilt. 
 The Uruguay Round is the first in which the developing countries have 
 played an important role and some these countries have been 
 important in the farming-based (back-and-forth conversations to agree on something). Developing country food exporters have played an active role in the Cairns group supporting (easing government rules) with a view to raising world prices of their exports. Food importers 
 have raised concerns about the likely hit/effect of the policy reform on world 
 prices of farming-based valuable things and about their ability to carry/have a  higher 
 import bill, although recent analysis hints that, given the typical struc- 
 
 AGRICULTURAL TRADE LIBERALIZATION IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES

 ture of developing country policies, many food importers are likely to gain 
 from many-sided trade reform (Loo and Tower, 1990; Anderson and Tyers, 
 1991). 
 How are the developing countries going to be affected by a freedom-creating 
 result from the Uruguay Round and the one-way/one-sided farming-based policy 
 changes happening along with the round? The answer to this question 
 depends heavily upon the type of policy changes begun/tried and on the 
 (features/ qualities/ traits) of these countries. As we'll see in this paper, the effects 
 on a particular country will depend heavily upon whether it participates in 
 the (easing government rules) and because of this collects (wasting very little while working or producing something) gains. Also, it will 
 depend upon their trading position in the valuable things affected: in general, 
 importers would be expected to benefit from changes which lower the 
 prices of their imports, and exporters to gain from price rises, but this need 
 not always be the case in the real world situation where big distortions 
 remain after a partial trade reform. 
 In this paper we review a few (numbers-based) tests of the possible 
 effects/results/suggestions of the Uruguay Round, focusing on the effects on developing 
 countries. This is done as follows: Section 2 provides some background for 
 the rest of the paper with a brief discussion of the farming-based policy 
 distortions whose (easing government rules) is to be examined; Section 3 reviews the 
 results of previous studies which have examined the hit/effect of farming-based 
 (easing government rules) at a disaggregated level; Section 4 presents results of a partial 
 (easing government rules) analysis using a world trade model, RUNS ((away from cities)-City-based; 
 North-South), which has (not very long ago) been updated in a joint research project 
 of the World Bank and the OECD Development Centre (Goldin, Knudsen 
 and van der Mensbrugghe, honest/appearing soon). In Section 5 some ending/deciding 
 statements are offered. 
 2. PATTERN OF AGRICULTURAL PROTECTION 
 
 In the early stages of development, the (compared to other things) large share of farming in the (process of people making, selling, and buying things) and in exports and the relative ease of collection of 
 border taxes have (previously) influenced governments to taxing farming-based exports. 
 The (compared to other things) high costs connected with effective political organization of 
 large numbers of producers in remote areas away from cities and the resulting political 
 weakness of the farm part/area relative to city-based  interests have also greatly 
 strengthened this habit/desire. Many analysts now argue that developing 
 countries have often taxed farming beyond the level which (accomplishes or gains) 
 the desired policy goals. Untargeted payments to city-based  people 
 through price controls, (assigned too high a value to) exchange rates and (machines/methods/ways) of 
 industrial help often also force (on people) a serious load on developing 
 country farming.

 A. BRANDAO AND W.J. MARTIN 
 
 The World Bank began/tried a major study of farming-based pricing policies 
 in place in 18 'representative' developing countries 1 during the period 
 1960-84 (Krueger, Schiff and Valdes, 1988, 1991). One of the goals of 
 the study was to uncover the nature and extent of taxation of farming in 
 these countries. An important feature of the study is the use of a common 
 way(s) of doing things which allows intercountry comparisons. Schiff and Valdes 
 (1992) have carefully studied the broad (features/ qualities/ traits) of price helping actions in the 
 18 countries. Some of their findings are summarized below: 
 (1) Most of the sample countries taxed the farming-based part/area, with the 
 tax rate being highest in the poorest countries. The countries with the 
 highest level of per person income, Korea and Portugal, protected farming during the period. 
 (2) The effects of indirect policy measures (exchange rate overvaluation 
 and industrial part/area protection) were usually stronger than the effects of 
 direct policies for most countries. The average rate of direct farming-based 
 help was -7.9%, while the average total rate of help was 
 -30.3%. 
 (3) Direct policies tend to be used to protect importable valuable things 
 even when these are staple foods. Exportables are often taxed. On 
 average, the rates of direct help for staples and importables were 6% 
 and 14%, (match up each pair of items in order). The similar average total rates of protection 
 were -16.5% and - 8.6%, (match up each pair of items in order). For exportables, direct (negative) 
 protection averaged -12.6% and total (negative) protection averaged 
 -34.6%. For all countries total protection for exportable valuable things was 
 negative, though its level was very low for Portugal. 
 (4) Two of the three sub-Saharan countries included in the sample, Cote 
 d'Ivoire and Ghana, had positive total protection of staples and importables. The average for Sub-Saharan Africa was negative due to the very high taxes charged in Zambia. 
 (5) Other countries that protected staples and importables, taking into 
 account direct and indirect policies, were Brazil, Korea, Malaysia, Portugal, 
 and Sri Skinnya. 
 The protection information file collected for the RUNS project provides another, more recent, indication of farming-based protection levels in developing countries. This information file was collected mostly on the basis of data on 
 farming-based trade distortions collected by the Money-based Research Service 
 
 1 Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Cote d'Ivoire, Dominican Republic, Egypt, Ghana, 
 Korea, Malaysia, Morocco, Pakistan, Philippines, Portugal, Sri Skinnya, Thailand, Turkey, 
 and Zambia.

 (ERS) of the USDA 2 (see Webb, Lopez and Penn, 1990) increased/added, 
 where necessary, with guesses from the Krueger, Schiff and Valdes study. 
 The guesses used were averages for 1985 to 1987, a period for which a 
 (well enough/good enough/in a smart way) wide coverage of countries is available. (related to a large area) averages were 
 formed from production weighted averages of the available national guesses. The guessed rates of help (expressed as a percentage of 
 (clear and appearing as it should/without any changes from the truth)  values) were divided into two categories: the first being border 
 protection measures which introduce a distortion between internal prices 
 and world market prices; and the second being help gave/given directly 
 to producers. 
 Some patterns are obvious from the grouped data, shown in 
 Table 1: 
 (a) Upper-Income Asia protects most farming-based valuable things 
 heavily. This is agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with the results of Krueger, Schiff and Valdes 
 and others who have noted the habit/desire for the higher income countries to protect farming. 
 (b) China taxed most farming-based valuable things heavily in the sample period. 
 (c) Rice and. sugar are usually protected with China being an important 
 exception in the case of rice. 
 (d) Rough grains are also usually protected. Exceptions were China, 
 Mrica and India. 
 (e) Nigeria, an oil exporter, protected most valuable things. However, it taxed 
 cocoa, a nonfood exportable. 
 (f) In the other areas, a mixed pattern of taxation and protection is 
 obvious. 
 While these results confirm some of the findings of Krueger, Schiff and 
 Valdes, they also highlight the fact that the pattern of protection in the 
 developing countries is quite (many different kinds of people or things). Taxation of farming continues to 
 be an important part of the policies put into use in these areas, but 
 protection, sometimes at high rates, is watched/followed for some valuable things and areas. 
 Guesses of the help (taken from OECD, 1991) gave/given to their 
 farming-based parts/areas by the OECD countries are presented in Table 2. By 
 contrast with the developing countries, direct help to farming was 
 always positive for both border protection measures and domestic payments. Valuable things such as dairy products and sugar were heavily supported 
 
 We are thankful to Carlos Mabbs-Zeno and Renata Penn of the ERS for supplying up until now 
 unpublished guesses prepared after (book, magazine, etc.) of the Webb, Lopez and Penn (1990) 
 volume.

 a Total farming-based protection is divided into two parts/pieces, both expressed as a proportion of the gross value of output: (1) Border 
 protection measures the effects of distortions which change the relationship between domestic and world prices (e.g. taxes/import taxes, import 
 quotas). (2) Domestic support measures the effects of policies which affect the money-making ability of production without directly affecting 
 personal protection (e.g. payments to producers).

 high in 1a pan, the EC and EFTA, but low in the more land-plentiful 
 areas (the USA, Canada and Australia/New Zealand). 
 Since the RUNS model is fully general balance in range, it can take 
 into account the effects of farming-based protection/taxation in the big picture 
 of distortions in other traded products (that are bought and sold)  markets. Guesses of average protection rates in each RUNS area to four group non-farming-based valuable things (energy, (material that makes plants grow better), machinery and other manufactures) were collected by Roland-Holst (1991) and are reported in Table 3. From these 
 guesses, it is clear that rates of protection to the manufacturing part/area in 
 developing countries were usually positive and higher than the rates of 
 help to agriculture. Very differently, manufacturing part/area protection was 
 much lower than help to agriculture in the developed country areas. 
 3. RECENT STUDIES OF THE IMPACT OF AGRICULTURAL LIBERALIZATION 
 
 Maybe luckily, the beginning/graduation ceremony of the Uruguay Round closely 
 followed the development of large scale farming-based trade models able to 
 provide answers to the basic questions arising in the (putting into) use of worldwide  farming-based trade (easing government rules). The models allow the 
 instruments moved around/misled and tricked by policy makers such as taxes/import taxes and quotas to be 
 linked to final/best goals of trade (easing government rules) such as national welfare 
 and distribution, this way avoiding the need to focus only on close/nearest 
 targets such as trade creation 3 whose effects/results/suggestions may be very sneaky and false. 
 The attention given to farming-based trade (easing government rules) in the round greatly 
 stimulated the development of trade models during the 1980s. The model 
 results, and the ideas created, were made widely available and appear 
 to have influenced the positions of many of the negotiators. 
 Worldwide  farming-based modeling is a complex balancing effort, with a 
 hard  balance to be drawn between (taking by force)/(taking control of) the central features of the 
 issue and keeping/holding a doable model. The farming-based part/area is very 
 (many different kinds of people or things), with many outputs from a common useful thing/valuable supply base being the 
 norm; and with the farming-based useful things/valuable supplies of countries being strongly 
 (made different), needing/ordering including a (compared to other things) wide range of valuable things. Up-and-down market linkages, especially for feed grains, introduce 
 further difficulties. Also, the long (not being there; not being present) of farming from 
 GATT fields of study has added/has given to the huge amount of domestic and trade 
 3 Rules of thumb based on guesses of trade creation such as that suggested in The 
 Money-flow expert (1992, p. 55), " ... for countries (before that/before now) separated by quite high trade (blocking things), 
 the gain in welfare due to trade (easing government rules) equals about one fifth of the (act of something getting bigger, wider, etc.) of 
 trade" cannot be expected to give reliable results in a many-sided big picture.

 policy tests/lists of questions, many of which are non-clear/open and honest and hard to 
 model. 
 Without full trade (easing government rules) being a possibility, the (back-and-forth conversations to agree on something) have 
 remained in the famously hard  domain of second best welfare test where nothing is known in general about the welfare results of 
 a single (easing government rules). Only if a model is carefully specified to deal with 
 this problem can definite welfare ends/end results be gotten. Second best 
 approaches to welfare test are likely to be important within farming, where there is generally large amounts of (many different kinds of people or things) between valuable things 
 in levels of help and also between farming and the rest of 
 the (process of people making, selling, and buying things). The importance of this point was highlighted by the striking 
 findings of Loo and Tower (1990) that net food importers could, under 
 realistic facts or conditions (that surround someone), .gain from higher world prices. 
 In most models, working well growth has been viewed as (coming from the outside of something)ly 
 decided/figured out. In the spirit of modern endogenous growth explanation, however, 
 some of the more recent studies of farming-based trade (easing government rules) (e.g., 
 Anderson and Tyers, 1990; Brandao, Tsigas, van der Mensbrugghe and 
 Goldin, 1992) have incorporated an endogenous, positive response of 
 research and development and because of this technology to the level of producer 
 prices. With (easing government rules) in the developed countries, producer prices tend 
 to fall in the developed countries and to rise in the developing countries, so 
 that technical progress speeds up in poor countries relative to the 
 developed countries. 
 Model results 
 
 While the final/best goal of trade (easing government rules) policies must be to 
 improve welfare, much of the modeling work has focussed upon an 
 intermediate effect: the hit/effect of (easing government rules) on world prices of farming-based valuable things. Most studies, except the new model by Valdes 
 and Zietz (1980), have clearly incorporated a full set of own-and crossprice effects and there has been a habit/desire for the elasticities used to 
 come together over time, especially once long/big compendia of farming-based 
 elasticities became available (Sullivan, Wainio and Roningen, 1989). There 
 has also been a marked habit/desire towards coming together in the guesses of 
 the importance of the policy-caused distortions, with heavy reliance placed 
 on the guesses collected by the OECD for developed countries and the 
 USDA (ERS) for developing countries. 
 Similar guesses of the effects of trade (easing government rules) on farming-based prices have been produced by a few studies. Most of the models 
 have been used to provide indications of the results of trade 
 (easing government rules) in developed countries. A summary of the guessed hits/effects

 on world prices of major valuable things from these studies is given in 
 Table 4. 
 While there is large amounts of difference/different version in the results presented in Table 4, 
 there are also some steady patterns. With farming-based protection eliminated, supply from the developed countries falls and the world prices of 
 most valuable things are, in most cases, (described the future) to rise. The prices of the 
 (compared to other things) heavily protected dairy, sugar and meat valuable things are usually guessed to rise by more than other valuable things. Wheat prices are 
 generally expected to rise (in a big way), reflecting the removal of the high 
 average rates of protection in the developed countries. There is, however, 
 an important warning on this last-talked about/said result, connected with the 
 generally (very simple/rough and rude) treatment of farming-based protection in the models: once the 
 effects of supply-reducing features of current policies are carefully thought about/believed, 
 output in the United States and in some other developed country suppliers 
 may increase and prices could fall (Whalley and Wigle, 1990). For almost 
 all of the studies, the price of rice is expected to rise by less than the price 
 of all of the other grains. This result reflects the (compared to other things) minor importance of the developed countries as a group in the world rice market. 
 Although there are exceptions to the rule, there is a habit/desire for the 
 price rises guessed by the three models listed at the bottom of the table, 
 the general balance models, to be somewhat less than the guesses 
 received/got from the partial balance models. This result likely reflects the 
 greater substitution possibilities in the general balance models, where 
 the flow of useful things/valuable supplies between parts/areas is clearly incorporated. 
 Much less (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) is available on the results of (easing government rules) 
 involving both the developed and developing countries since most modeling

 efforts have focussed on OECD policy (easing government rules) alone. The set of 
 available guesses of the effects of (happening together) (easing government rules) in both 
 developed and developing country markets is presented in Table 5. 
 The guesses presented in Table 5 involve the removal of the often 
 positive protection in developed countries and the often negative 
 protection in the developing countries. The guesses this way refer to a 
 broad-based move to (easing government rules) of all farming-based trade distortions, 
 including negative producer distortions whose removal is unlikely to be 
 needed/demanded by a GATT agreement. The effect on rice is very clearly reversed 
 relative to the OECD (easing government rules) case, with the negative protection in 
 poor countries outweighing the positive effect from the developed 
 countries. The positive effects on wheat prices are reduced or reversed in 
 most cases. However, the picture is less clear cut for dairy products and 
 meat where many developing countries provide positive help. The 
 guesses of the results of including developing country (easing government rules) are far more (many different kinds of people or things) than the guesses for developed country (easing government rules) alone, in part because of the poor quality of the guesses of 
 developing country policy distortions available to these studies and in part 
 because of the often offsetting nature of the distortions in developed 
 and developing (processes of people making, selling, and buying things). 
 The available (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) on the effects of (easing government rules) on welfare in the 
 developing countries is even more limited and (many different kinds of people or things) than the (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) on 
 world prices. Most early research tended to focus on the mild/not extreme 
 farming-based products mostly exported by the developed countries and 
 decided that developing countries, as net importers of these products, 
 would lose from (easing government rules)-caused price increases. Once developing

 Notes: The valuable thing coverage of the Krissoff et al. study is (a) little wider than for 
 Anderson and Tyers (1991) because Anderson and Tyers think about/believe only mild/not extreme products: 
 wheat, rough grain, rice, (buffalo, deer, antelope, etc.) meat, nonruminant meat dairy products and sugar. 
 Krissoff et al. also include oilseeds, cotton and tobacco. Neither study thinks about/believes the (related to areas near the Equator/hot and humid) 
 drinks of most important importance to many developing countries. The Krissoff et al. study 
 measures welfare changes by combining hits/effects on producer extra, Marshallian personal 
 extra and direct government money/money income relative to a 1986 (a measure of what occurs naturally/sports boundary line). Anderson and Tyers 
 measure welfare changes in 1985 dollars using producer extra, Dummiesian personal extra 
 and direct hits/effects on government money/money income.

 country (easing government rules) is included, this linkage becomes somewhat less 
 consistent, with world prices of valuable things produced subject to negative 
 help in developing countries falling, and with the developing countries themselves experiencing (wasting very little while working or producing something) gains as a result of the 
 removal of their own policy distortions. The results received/got also depend 
 heavily upon whether (money given/freedom to move) is made for endogenous working well 
 growth. 
 (well enough/good enough/in a smart way) similar results for the welfare results of complete trade (easing government rules) are available from a recent study by Anderson 
 and Tyers (1991, p. 26) and a USDA study by Krissoff, Sullivan, Wainio 
 and Johnston (1990, pp. 45-46). The USDA study is 'conventional' in not 
 including any (reactions or responses to something/helpful returned information) from price changes to working well growth. The 
 Anderson and Tyers study, very differently, includes (reactions or responses to something/helpful returned information) from price 
 changes to (related to computers and science) advance. The results received/got in both studies 
 include those from an experiment in which only the improved 
 (processes of people making, selling, and buying things) liberalize and results when all (processes of people making, selling, and buying things) participate in the 
 (easing government rules). 
 When the developed countries alone liberalize, the Krissoff et al. (1990) 
 results (presented in Table 6) point to losses for most developing countries, 
 although these are small relative to developing country GDP. However, 
 when the developing countries participate in the (easing government rules) process, the 
 picture changes much as they benefit from reductions in deadweight 
 losses and, sometimes, from terms of trade changes. With worldwide 
 (easing government rules), most of the (processes of people making, selling, and buying things) of Asia and Latin America are 
 projected to experience gains. In Africa, the food importing countries of 
 North Africa and the Middle East experience losses while Sub-Saharan 
 Africa as a whole experiences a small welfare gain. The former Soviet 
 Union is projected to experience a big welfare loss because of 
 increases in the price of imported food. 
 In the Anderson and Tyers results (1991), the developing countries in 
 group gain, even in the case where only the OECD countries liberalize. 
 However, the gain to the developing countries is much larger when they 
 participate in the (easing government rules): in this case, the welfare gain more than 
 doubles- from US $16.6 billion to US $33.4 billion. In the case where only 
 the industrial countries liberalize, the developing countries which lose are 
 mostly heavy food importers such as the North African oil exporters, 
 Taiwan (China) and Bangladesh. When the distortionary effects of policies 
 in the developing (processes of people making, selling, and buying things) are removed in the second experiment, only a 
 very few developing (processes of people making, selling, and buying things) continue to experience losses and these are 
 (compared to other things) minor. From a comparison with the Krissoff et al. results, and 
 with earlier results with the Tyers-Anderson model, it appears that the 
 including in something of endogenous technical change has important (possible) results for the 
 results.

 The focus of most of the books has been on the effects/results/suggestions of 
 complete (easing government rules) even though complete trade (easing government rules) 
 will clearly not happen as a result of the Uruguay Round. Recent studies by 
 Loo and Tower (1990), Tyers and Falvey (1989) and by Martin, Knudsen, 
 Tsigas and van der Mensbrugghe (1991) make it clear that the results of partial (easing government rules) cannot be assumed to be a simple fraction 
 of the results of total (easing government rules). Loo and Tower (1990) (show or prove) that (based on what's seen or what seems obvious) surprising results, such as food importers gaining 
 from increases in the price of food, are (able to be done). 
 The analysis begun/tried for this paper is different from the earlier studies in 
 dealing specifically with a few types of partial (easing government rules) in order to 
 capture the possibly important welfare results of this (easing government rules). It focusses on farming-based (easing government rules), rather than the overall 
 (easing government rules) of trade policies thought about/believed by Goldin and van der Mensbrugghe (1992), but uses the full general balance (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) given by the RUNS model to take by force/take control of the full set of interactions between 
 valuable things. The analysis in this paper is also custom-designed more specifically to 
 the particular features of the Dunkel (easing government rules) package than are the 
 earlier studies. 
 4. IMPLICATIONS OF AGRICULTURAL LIBERALIZATION FOR THE 
 DEVELOPING COUNTRIES: RESULTS FROM THE RUNS MODEL 
 
 The RUNS model was (at first/before other things happened) developed by Jean-Marc Burniaux and 
 Jean Waelbroeck. The current version of RUNS is described in Goldin, 
 Knudsen and van der Mensbrugghe (honest/appearing soon) and recorded/supported completely in Burniaux and van der Mensbrugghe (1991) 4 . 
 The model contains the 22 areas described in the note to Table 1. 
 There are two farming-based parts/areas in each area: crops and animals. The 
 crops part/area produces eleven valuable things and the animals part/area four. 
 Five manufacturing products (that are bought and sold)  are produced by single output parts/areas. 
 There is perfect substitution between domestic and traded farming-based 
 valuable things. For manufactures, however, products (that are bought and sold)  are (made different) according to area of origin using the Armington (detailed description of exactly what is required) (with a CES 
 function for imports and a CET function for exports). 
 There are four first (or most important) factors: capital, labor, land and draught (cows, bulls, etc.). 
 Investment is driven by savings. The capital stock in the manufacturing 
 part/area is fully mobile across valuable things. In the (away from cities) parts/areas, capital and 
 The following description of the model draws heavily on Burniaux and van der Mensbrugghe (1991).

 dry land are grouped into a (made up of different things) factor and labor, draught (cows, bulls, etc.), 
 and watered land are combined in another (made up of different things) factor. (away from cities) investment is figured out by/decided by the relative a money-making state of the different valuable things: dry 
 land, watered land, tractors and draught (cows, bulls, etc.). 
 A labor traveling equation, driven by the difference between city-based  and 
 (away from cities) per person incomes, together with population growth, decides/figures out the 
 portion of labor between the (away from cities) and city-based  parts/areas. In the version of 
 the model used here, a flexible wage rate maintains constant employment 
 of labor. 
 Land is modeled (thinking about/when one thinks about) both an guessed upper bound on availability and actual demand. As actual demand gets closer to the maximum 
 availability, the not important cost of land use increases. 
 The (detailed description of exactly what is required) of demands for current consumption products (that are bought and sold)  and for 
 saving is based on the Extended Linear Expense System for both the 
 city-based  and the (away from cities) families. (away from cities) (extra income you can spend on fun things)s consist of net 
 (of factor taxes) returns to factors, the (away from cities) part/area's share of the net 
 government money/money income created by price distortions and the value added 
 tax, and a part of the costs of stock operations. 5 City-based  (extra income you can spend on fun things)s 
 consist of net (of factor taxes) returns to factors and the leftover/extra of net 
 government money/money income from market distortions, the value added tax, and 
 stock operations. 
 Government expenses are assumed to grow at the same rate as GDP. 
 Government money/money income are received/got from trade taxes on farming-based and 
 non-farming-based valuable things, from a tax on value added and from farming-based stockholding operations. In the closure used in this analysis tax rates 
 were (coming from the outside of something), making government savings (the (extra money)jdeficit) 
 endogenous. 
 The model was closed with the idea (you think is true) of an (coming from the outside of something) balance of 
 trade restriction or, equally, supply of foreign savings to the (process of people making, selling, and buying things). 
 With domestic private and government consumption and savings decisions 
 clearly modeled, investment spending was figured out by/decided by the availability 
 of savings. The model was adjusted with data for 1985 and is solved until 
 the year 2002 in three-year small steps forward/upward. 
 The data base includes guesses of price distortions on farming-based and 
 non-farming-based products (that are bought and sold). The farming-based price distortions in OECD countries were gotten from OECD (1991) guesses for the years 1986, 1987, 
 1988 and 1990, straddling the base periods used in the current proposals 
 for trade reform. As discussed above, guesses of farming-based distortions

 in the developing countries in the 1985-87 period were built using 
 USDA (ERS) and World Bank data. 
 The farming-based policy legal documents in RUNS consist of ad braveryem 
 wedges for separations between domestic and world prices, and for separations between the prices received by producers and paid by people. 
 The first measure is expressed as a fixed tax/import tax equal while the second 
 is understood/explained as a producer helping payment equal incorporating all help 
 paid directly to producers without directly affecting the market price. The 
 results presented below deal with the long run response to (easing government rules) 
 and because of this full price transmission between world and domestic prices is 
 assumed. 
 Since the (detailed description of exactly what is required) of the model is based strongly on money-based 
 explanation, it is possible to relate the model results to the hidden (under) expense and money/money income functions, and because of this to measure welfare changes using a 
 change of the Trade Expense Function approach (Anderson and 
 Neary, 1992; Martin, 1992). The approach measures the effects of changes 
 in all (numbers that change/things that change) on the cost of (accomplishing or gaining) a given level of utility, less any 
 effects on money/money income from production and taxation. As (showed/shown or proved) by 
 Martin et al. (1991), this approach has the advantage of allowing consistent 
 measures of the welfare results of policy changes in the presence of 
 many distortions. 
 
 Model results 
 From a trade (easing government rules) (way of seeing things / sensible view of what is and is not important), the best result now likely to 
 be (accomplished or gained) under the Uruguay Round is an agreement along the lines of 
 the Dunkel (GATT, 1991) proposal. Key features of this proposal for 
 farming-based policy reform under the GATT are: 
 - Tax/import taxication of import (blocking things) and their reduction by an average of 
 36% from their 1986-88 average tax/import tax equals. 
 - Reduction of 36% in budget outlays on export payments from a 19861989 base and a reduction of 24% in the amount/quantity of paid-for exports. 
 - Reduction of 20% in group measure of domestic support (AMS) 
 relative to a fixed 1986-88 average external reference price. 
 The reduction needed things apply to positive protection, and suggest no 
 needed thing to reduce export taxes or import payments. Further, developing country members of GATT are allowed special and differential (legal rules) which require reductions only two thirds the size of those needed/demanded of 
 developed countries, and least developed countries are (not having to pay/not having to obey) 
 reduction promises. 
 Some simplification is needed/demanded if the broad features of a likely worldwide 
 agreement are to be (taken by force/controlled). Tax/import taxication of import (blocking things) and their 
 
 AGRICULTURAL TRADE LIBERALIZATION IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES 
 
 331 
 
 reduction by 36% is easily (taken/took by force)/(taken/took control of) in the modeling (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) used in 
 this study. However, a 36% reduction in the value of export payments by a 
 single country would usually require less than a 36% reduction in the ad 
 braveryem equal of such an export helping payment since the value reduction 
 would result from changes in both the rate of help and in the amount 
 exported. In a many-sided big picture, reductions in export payments are likely 
 to raise world prices, offsetting the reduction in export amounts/quantities suggested by 
 declines in export payments. So, treating reductions in export payments as 
 a 36% reduction in export helping payment rates seems likely to provide a reasonable guess to the effects of the proposal. 
 The limitation on the amount/quantity of paid-for exports that is also part of 
 the proposal was not thought about/believed in the experiment. Either the price 
 instrument or the amount restriction, but not both, can be effective and, in 
 a growing world (process of people making, selling, and buying things), the price (tool or object used to do work or measure something) is more likely to be 
 effective in the long run. 
 The actual needed thing forced on domestic payments by the Dunkel 
 proposal is specified through a 20% reduction in the value of an Group 
 Measure of Support (AMS), including both domestic payments and border 
 measures. Since the support given by border measures is to be reduced 
 by more than 20%, the needed/demanded reduction in purely domestic support 
 measures may at first be less than the 20%. However, the use of a fixed 
 reference price will raise the calculated AMS if world prices of valuable things rise following (easing government rules) and place a undoing downward pressure on domestic help. Over time, further downward pressure may be 
 placed on domestic help levels by wearing away of the real value of the 
 fixed Group Measure of Support. On balance, specifying a reduction of 
 20% in the rate of help given by domestic supports seems likely to 
 provide a reasonable representation of the effects of the proposal. 
 Four broad (easing government rules) pictures/situations are carefully thought about/believed: the putting into use 
 of the Dunkel package in the developed country; a almost the same  reduction in all 
 protection (positive and negative) in developed and developing countries; a 
 package like the complete Dunkel proposal, with smaller protection reductions in the developing countries, and a further experiment under which 
 only the developing countries liberalize by the same amount as the developed countries in the other tests. 
 All results shown below are for the year 2002, and so incorporate most 
 of the long run supply and demand changes/recalculations that will follow the 
 (easing government rules) process. Due to space limits, only two sets of results are 
 discussed below: the hit/effect on world prices (expressed relative to the 
 model's numeraire, the average price of OECD exports of manufactures) 
 and on welfare.

 World Prices. The first two columns of Table 7 display the hits/effects on 
 world prices of Dunkel type partial (easing government rules) by the OECD countries 
 alone. In the first column, it is assumed that the U.S. land set aside policy 
 is unchanged following (easing government rules). Dairy, sugar, beef and wheat are the 
 valuable things for which the largest price increases are watched/followed, reflecting 
 the high levels of protection in the OECD countries. All other price 
 increases are smaller than 3%. The prices of coffee and cocoa, crops not 
 directly affected by the policy change, are only (only a little bit) affected. Tea, 
 another crop not directly affected by the price change, experiences a 
 somewhat larger price increase. This is likely because developing countries that are important producers of tea will move away from the 
 crop into wheat, sugar, rough grains and animals. 
 The guessed effects on world prices received/got from this (testing out) 
 appear broadly in line with the results received/got in the earlier studies 
 reported in Table 4 when (money given/freedom to move) is made for the fact that we have 
 thought about/believed only partial farming-based (easing government rules) of the type likely to result 
 from the Uruguay Round while the earlier studies thought about/believed full liberal- 
 
 AGRICULTURAL TRADE LIBERALIZATION IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES

 ization. Given this difference, we might expect our results to be in the 
 order of a third to a quarter of the importance of those watched/followed in the 
 earlier studies. When scaled up to reflect this, our result for wheat is of the 
 same (at least ten times as much/less than 1/10th as much) as most of the results in Table 4. Rice, (in almost the same way), 
 falls well within the range watched/followed in the earlier studies, as do the results 
 for meat. Our dairy result is agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with the OECD jMTM model 
 results and the IIASA results but well below the guesses reported by 
 Anderson and Tyers (1990) and by the USDAjSWOPSIM model. The 
 sugar result is much closer to the results reported for other models than for 
 the earlier version of the RUNS model. 
 Valuable thing policy in the United States contains two broad types of 
 instruments: price support payments which increase the level of 
 output; and land set aside needed things which reduce the level of 
 output. While the exact link between the two (tools or objects used to do work or measure something) is hard to 
 specify, higher levels of price support increase the ability of policy makers 
 to cause farmers to withdraw land from production and, by placing 
 downward pressure on world prices, require reductions in U.S. production. 
 The use of producer helping payment equals ignores the effects of set aside 
 needed things. To test the sensitivity of the model results to changes in 
 this limit/guideline, set aside ratios for the major field crops in the United 
 States (wheat, rough grains, cotton and rice 6 ) are relaxed by 20% from 
 their average values over the period 1985 to 1991, in line with the reduction 
 in domestic support levels. In this experiment, world prices increase (a) little 
 less than before, except for oils. Clearly, the reduction in the set aside 
 needed things for competing crops, such as corn, draws land away from 
 soybeans, this way<p><strong>NOTE: This document is incomplete. It was shortened to the maximum document length of 50,000 characters.</strong></p><div style="clear:both">&nbsp;</div>
