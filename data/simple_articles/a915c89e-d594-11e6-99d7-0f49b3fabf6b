 ABSTRACT 
 In this paper we examine levels and (moves in a particular way/becomes popular) in farming-based output and working well in 93 
 developed and developing countries that account for a major part of/amount of the world population 
 and farming-based output. We make use of data drawn from the Food and Farming 
 Organization of the United Nations and our study covers the period 1980-2000. Due to the 
 non-availability of reliable input price data, the study uses data envelopment analysis (DEA) 
 to get Malmquist working well indexes. The study examines (popular things/general ways things are going) in farming-based 
 working well over the period. Issues of catch-up and coming together, or sometimes possible 
 separation, in working well in farming are examined within a worldwide  (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built). The paper 
 also gets the shadow prices and value shares that are understood in the DEA-based 
 Malmquist working well indices, and examines the believability of their levels and (moves in a particular way/becomes popular) over 
 the study period.

 Introduction 
 
 Working well growth in farming has been the subject matter for intense research over the 
 last fifty years. Development money-flow experts and farming-based money-flow experts have examined the 
 sources of working well growth over time and of working well differences among countries and 
 areas over this period. Working well growth in the farming-based part/area is carefully thought about/believed very important 
 if farming-based part/area output is to grow at a (good or well enough) fast rate to meet the demands for 
 food and raw materials arising out of steady population growth. During the 1970's and 80's a 
 number of major analyses of cross-country differences in farming-based working well were 
 conducted, including Hayami and Ruttan (1970, 1971), Kawagoe and Hayami (1983, 1985), 
 Kawagoe, Hayami and Ruttan (1985), Capalabo and Antle (1988), and Lau and Yotopoulos 
 (1989). 
 Most of these studies used thin sliceal data on about 40 countries to 
 guess a Cobb-Douglas production technology using moving backward methods. The focus was 
 generally on the guess of the production elasticities and the (act of asking questions and trying to find the truth about something) of the 
 (things that are given/work that's done) of farm scale, eduction and research in explaining cross-country labour 
 working well differentials.1 
 In the past ten years, the number of papers (asking lots of questions about/trying to find the truth about) cross-country differences in 
 farming-based working well levels and growth rates has expanded significantly. This is most 
 likely driven by three factors. First, the availability of some new panel data sets, such as that 
 produced by the Food and Farming Organisation of the United Nations (FAO). Second, 
 the development of new scientific ways of doing things to analyse this type of data, such as the data 
 envelopment analysis (DEA) and (random/including random data points) edge of something/unexplored area analysis (SFA) ways of doing things, described in 
 Coelli, Rao and Battese (1998). Thirdly, a desire to test the degree to which the green 
 revolution, and other programs, have improved farming-based working well in developing 
 countries. 
 In Table 1 we list 17 studies that have been done in the last ten years. Certain comments 
 can be made about these papers. First, most of these papers use FAO panel data, 
 spanning the 1960's, 70's and 80's. Of these 17 papers, 11 use DEA, five guess CobbDouglas production functions, one guesses a translog production function, and one uses the 
 Fisher index.2 In terms of country coverage, five papers focus on less developed countries 
 (LDC's), two analyse small groups of developed countries (DC's), three papers look at Asia 
 or Africa or the two combined, while the remaining seven studies study a mix of countries. 
 Four of these latter seven papers cover a large number of countries, ranging from 70 
 countries in Arnade (1998) to 115 countries in Wiebe et al (2000). 
 One of the repeating themes in the reported results in many of these papers is that less 
 developed countries show (related to computers and science) moving backward while the developed countries show 
 (related to computers and science) progress. For example, Fulginiti and Perrin (1997) studied 18 LDC's and found 
 that 14 of these countries showed a decline in farming-based working well over the period 19611985. Such results point to/show a separation in farming-based working well. However, these results 
 appear to be very different than the (popular things/general ways things are going) in manufacturing part/area and gross domestic 
 product level working well, which show signs of coming together (Barro and Sala-i-Martin, 1990 
 and Maddison, 1995). What's more, they do not appear to be obeying crop-level 
 1 
 
 Lau and Yotopolous (1989) also guessed a translog functional form to illustrate the restrictions built-in 
 in the Cobb-Douglas production technology.

 Two of these papers use two ways of doing things.

 evidence coming out of many developing countries in the past twenty years, especially in 
 South-East Asia. 
 The way of thinking/basic truth/rule aims is to provide up to date information on farming-based total factor 
 working well (TFP) growth over the past twenty years (1980-2000) for 93 of the largest 
 farming-based producers in the world. It should be noted that the study by Wiebe et al (2000) 
 does analyse TFP growth for 110 nations over the 1961-1997 period, however it does use the 
 Cobb-Douglas production function, which introduces some (serving to severely limit or control) ideas (you think are true). 
 Such as, constant production elasticities (and because of this input shares) across all countries, Dummiesneutral technical change, plus it needs/demands that crop and animals outputs be grouped into a 
 single output measure. The analysis in the present study uses the DEA way of doing things to calculate 
 Malmquist TFP index numbers. This method does not make any of the above ideas (you think are true). 
 However, it is (able to be harmed by) the effects of data noise, and can suffer from the problem of 
 "unusual" shadow prices, when degrees of freedom are limited. 
 This issue of shadow prices is important, and is one that is not well understood among 
 authors who apply these Malmquist DEA methods. A major advantage referred to in support of 
 the use of DEA in measuring working well growth, is that these methods do not require any 
 price data. This is a clear/separate advantage, because in general, farming-based input price data are 
 almost never available and such prices could be twisted/partially untrue/lied about due to government helping action in most 
 developing countries. However, an important point needs to be added here. Even though the 
 DEA-based working well measures may not clearly use market price information, they do 
 completely/in a hinting way use shadow price information, came/coming from the shape of the guessed production 
 surface. This issue is described in some detail in Coelli and Prasada Rao (2001), who show 
 that one can use these shadow prices to calculate shadow shares information, to help shed 
 light on the factors influencing these working well growth measures. Hence, a main aim of 
 this paper is to (show or prove) the (ability to be done) of clearly identifying the understood shadow shares 
 and to study (related to a large area) difference/different version and (moves in a particular way/becomes popular) in these shares over time. 
 In our view, this shadow share information can provide valuable ideas of why different 
 authors have gotten widely different TFP growth measures for some countries, when 
 applying these Malmquist DEA methods. This has been especially obvious when the 
 applications have involved panel data sets containing small groups of countries, and the 
 countries included in each data set differ from study to study. 
 The rest of this paper is organised into sections. In Section 2 we describe the DEA and 
 Malmquist TFP index methods that are used in the study. In Section 3 we describe the data 
 that is used, while in Section 4 we present and discuss our results. Some ending/deciding 
 comments are made in the final section.

 Way(s) of doing things 
 
 In this paper we measure total factor working well (TFP) using the Malmquist index methods 
 described in Fare et al (1994) and Coelli, Rao and Battese (1998, Ch. 10). This approach 
 uses data envelopment analysis (DEA) methods to construct a piece-wise linear production 
 edge of something/unexplored area for each year in the sample. We firstly provide a brief description of DEA methods 
 before we go on to describe the Malmquist TFP calculations. 
 Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) 
 DEA is a linear-programming way(s) of doing things, which uses data on the input and output 
 amounts of a group of countries to construct a piece-wise linear surface over the data points. 
 This edge of something/unexplored area surface is built by the solution of a sequence of linear programming 
 3 
 
 problems - one for each country in the sample. The degree of technical inefficiency of each 
 country (the distance between the watched/followed data point and the edge of something/unexplored area) is produced as a (something produced along with something else) of the edge of something/unexplored area construction method. 
 DEA can be either input-orientated or output-orientated. In the input-orientated case, the 
 DEA method defines the edge of something/unexplored area by looking (for) the maximum possible (fair in amount, related to something else/properly sized compared to something else) reduction in 
 input usage, with output levels held constant, for each country. While, in the outputorientated case, the DEA method looks (for) the maximum (fair in amount, related to something else/properly sized compared to something else) increase in output 
 production, with input levels held fixed. The two measures provide the same technical 
 (wasting very little while working or producing something) scores when a constant returns to scale (CRS) technology applies, but are unequal 
 when (number or thing that changes) returns to scale (VRS) is assumed. In this paper we assume a CRS technology 
 (the reasons for this are organized and listed in the Malmquist discussion below). So the choice of 
 orientation is not a big issue in our case. However, we have selected an output orientation 
 because we believe it would be fair to assume that, in farming, one usually tries to 
 (make as big as possible) output from a given set of inputs, rather than the converse.3 
 If one has data for N countries in a particular time period, the linear programming (LP) 
 problem that is solved for the i-th country in an output-orientated DEA model is as follows: 
 maxÏ,Î» Ï, 
 st 
 
 -Ïyi + YÎ» a¥ 0, 
 xi - XÎ» a¥ 0, 
 Î» a¥ 0, (1) 
 
 where 
 yi is a MÃ--1 vector of output amounts for the i-th country; 
 xi is a KÃ--1 vector of input amounts for the i-th country; 
 Y is a NÃ--M matrix of output amounts for all N countries; 
 X is a NÃ--K matrix of input amounts for all N countries; 
 Î» is a NÃ--1 vector of weights; and 
 Ï is a scalar. 
 Watch/notice that Ï will take a value greater than or equal to one, and that Ï-1 is the (fair in amount, related to something else/properly sized compared to something else) 
 increase in outputs that could be (accomplished or gained) by the i-th country, with input amounts held 
 constant. Note also that 1/Ï defines a technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) (TE) score which differs/changes between 
 zero and one (and that this is the output-orientated TE score reported in our results). 
 The above LP is solved N times - once for each country in the sample. Each LP produces a Ï 
 and a Î» vector. The Ï-limit/guideline provides information on the technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) score for 
 the i-th country and the Î»-vector provides information on the peers of the (inefficient) i-th 
 country. The peers of the i-th country are those (producing a lot with very little waste) countries that define the part/face  of the 
 edge of something/unexplored area against which the (inefficient) i-th country is projected. 
 The DEA problem can be illustrated using a simple example. Think about/believe the case where we 
 have a group of five countries producing two outputs (e.g., wheat and beef). Assume for 
 3 
 
 There are some obvious exceptions to this. For example, where dairy farmers are needed/demanded to fill a particular 
 output quota, and attempt to do this with minimum inputs. 
 
 4 
 
 simplicity that each country has identical input vectors. These five countries are shown in 
 Figure 1. Countries A, B and C are (producing a lot with very little waste) countries because they define the edge of something/unexplored area. 
 Countries D and E are inefficient countries. For country D the technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) score is 
 equal to 
 TED = 0D/0Da²,(2) 
 and its peers are countries A and B. In the DEA output listing this country would have a 
 technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) score of about 70 percent and would have non-zero Î»-weights 
 connected with countries A and B. For country E the technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) score is equal to 
 TEE = 0E/0Ea², (3) 
 and its peers are countries B and C. In the DEA output listing this country would have a 
 technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) score of about 50 percent and would have non-zero Î»-weights 
 connected with countries B and C. Note that the DEA output listing for countries A, B and C 
 would provide technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) scores equal to one and each country would be its own 
 (person who is in a similar age group or academic field). For further discussion of DEA methods see Coelli, Rao and Battese (1998, Ch. 6).

 The Malmquist TFP Index 
 The Malmquist index is defined using distance functions. Distance functions allow one to 
 describe a multi-input, multi-output production technology without the need to specify a 
 behavioural goal (such as cost minimisation or profit (biggest increase/best possible extent)). One may define 
 input distance functions and output distance functions. An input distance function 
 describes the production technology by looking at a (almost nothing/very little) (fair in amount, related to something else/properly sized compared to something else) contraction of 
 the input vector, given an output vector. An output distance function thinks about/believes a maximal 
 (fair in amount, related to something else/properly sized compared to something else) (act of something getting bigger, wider, etc.) of the output vector, given an input vector. We only think about/believe an 
 output distance function in detail in this paper. However, input distance functions can be 
 defined and used in a almost the same  manner. 
 A production technology may be defined using the output set, P(x), which represents the set 
 of all output vectors, y, which can be produced using the input vector, x. That is, 
 5 
 
 P(x) = y{ : x can produce y}. 
 
 (4) 
 
 We assume that the technology makes happy the true sayings listed in Coelli, Rao and Battese (1998, 
 Ch. 3) 
 The output distance function is defined on the output set, P(x), as: 
 do(x,y) = minÎ´{ : (y/Î´)aP(x)}. 
 
 (5) 
 
 The distance function, do(x,y), will take a value which is less than or equal to one if the 
 output vector, y, is a little bit of the (able to be done) production set, P(x). What's more, the distance 
 function will take a value of togetherness if y is located on the outer edge of the (able to be done) 
 production set, and will take a value greater than one if y is located outside the (able to be done) 
 production set. In this study we use DEA-like methods to calculate our distance measures. 
 These are discussed shortly. 
 The Malmquist TFP index measures the TFP change between two data points (e.g., those of a 
 particular country in two (next to) time periods) by calculating the ratio of the distances of 
 each data point relative to a common technology. Following FÃ¤re et al (1994), the Malmquist 
 (output-orientated) TFP change index between period s (the base period) and period t is given 
 by 
 a¡ d s (y , x ) d t (y , x ) a¤ 
 m o (y s , x s , y t , x t ) = a¢ so t t Ã-- ot t t a¥ 
 a£ d o (y s , x s ) d o (y s , x s ) a¦ 
 
 1/ 2 
 
 , 
 
 (6) 
 
 where the note dos(xt, yt) represents the distance from the period t (instance of watching, noticing, or making a statement) to the 
 period s technology. A value of mo greater than one will point to/show positive TFP growth from 
 period s to period t while a value less than one points to/shows a TFP decline. Note that equation 6 
 is, in fact, the geometric mean of two TFP indices. The first is tested with respect to 
 period s technology and the second with respect to period t technology. 
 An equal way of writing this working well index is 
 d ot (y t , x t ) a¡ d so (y t , x t ) d so (y s , x s ) a¤ 
 m o (y s , x s , y t , x t ) = s 
 Ã-- 
 a¢ 
 a¥ 
 d o (y s , x s ) a£ d ot (y t , x t ) d ot (y s , x s ) a¦ 
 
 1/ 2 
 
 , 
 
 (7) 
 
 where the ratio outside the square brackets measures the change in the output-oriented 
 measure of Farrell technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) between periods s and t. That is, the (wasting very little while working or producing something) 
 change is equal to the ratio of the technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) in period t to the technical 
 (wasting very little while working or producing something) in period s. The remaining part of the index in equation 2 is a measure of technical 
 change. It is the geometric mean of the move/change in technology between the two periods, 
 tested at xt and also at xs. 
 Following FÃ¤re et al (1994), and given that good panel data are available, we can calculate 
 the needed/demanded distance measures for the Malmquist TFP index using DEA-like linear programs. 
 For the i-th country, we must calculate four distance functions to measure the TFP change 
 between two periods, s and t. This needs/demands the solving of four linear programming (LP) 
 problems. FÃ¤re et al (1994) assume a constant returns to scale (CRS) technology in their 
 analysis. The needed/demanded LPs are: 
 [dot(yt, xt)]-1 = maxÏ,Î» Ï, 
 st 
 
 -Ïyit + YtÎ» a¥ 0, 
 xit - XtÎ» a¥ 0, 
 
 6 
 
 Î» a¥ 0, (8) 
 [dos(ys, xs)]-1 = maxÏ,Î» Ï, 
 st 
 
 -Ïyis + YsÎ» a¥ 0, 
 xis - XsÎ» a¥ 0, 
 Î» a¥ 0, (9) 
 
 [dot(ys, xs)]-1 = maxÏ,Î» Ï, 
 st 
 
 -Ïyis + YtÎ» a¥ 0, 
 xis - XtÎ» a¥ 0, 
 Î» a¥ 0, (10) 
 
 and 
 [dos(yt, xt)]-1 = maxÏ,Î» Ï, 
 st 
 
 -Ïyit + YsÎ» a¥ 0, 
 xit - XsÎ» a¥ 0, 
 Î» a¥ 0. (11) 
 
 Note that in LP's 10 and 11, where production points are compared to technologies from 
 different time periods, the Ï limit/guideline need not be greater than or equal to one, as it must be 
 when calculating standard output-orientated technical (measures of output versus waste/getting more with less waste). The data point could lie 
 above the production edge of something/unexplored area. This will most likely happen in LP 11 where a production point 
 from period t is compared to technology in an earlier period, s. If technical progress has 
 happened, then a value of Ï&amp;lt;1 is possible. Note that it could also possibly happen in LP 10 if 
 technical move backward has happened, but this is less likely. 
 One issue that must be stressed is that the returns to scale properties of the technology are 
 very important in TFP measurement. We use a CRS technology in this study for two reasons. 
 First, given that we are using group country-level data, it does not appear to be (reasonable/showing good judgment) 
 to think about  a VRS technology. How is it possible for a part/area to (accomplish or gain with effort) scale (processes of people making, selling, and buying things)? 
 For example, the index of crop output for India and the USA are almost the same, but their average 
 farm sizes are quite different. Because of this, what can we (in a way that is reasonable and shows good judgment) end/decide if we guess a VRS 
 technology and report that these countries face decreasing returns to scale? We can 
 understand the use of a VRS technology when the summary data is expressed on an "average 
 per farm" basis, because one can then discuss the scale (processes of people making, selling, and buying things) of the "average farm", but 
 when dealing with group data, as we are in this study, the use of a CRS technology is the 
 only (reasonable/showing good judgment) option. 
 In addition to the above comment (related to/looking at/thinking about) the use of group data, a second argument for 
 the use of a CRS technology is related to both firm-level and group data. Grifell-Tatje 
 and Lovell (1995) use a simple one-input, one-output example to illustrate that a Malmquist 
 TFP index may not correctly measure TFP changes when VRS is assumed for the technology. 
 Hence it is important that CRS be (forced (on people)/caused an inconvenient situation) upon any technology that is used to guess 
 distance functions for the calculation of a Malmquist TFP index. Otherwise the resulting 
 measures may not properly reflect the TFP gains or losses resulting from scale effects.

 Data 
 
 The present study is based on data only drawn from the AGROSTAT system of the 
 Statistics Division of the Food and Farming-based Organization in Rome. We have been able to 
 access and down-load all the necessary data from the Web site of the FAO.4 The following 
 are some of the main features of the data series used. 
 Country coverage: The study includes 93 countries. These are the top 93 farming-based 
 producers in the world, which account for about 97 percent of the world's farming-based 
 output as well as 98 percent of the world's population.5 The countries included in the study 
 are distributed over all the areas of the world. The distribution is as follows: 
 Africa 
 
 26 countries 
 
 North America 
 
 2 countries 
 
 South and Central America 
 
 19 countries 
 
 Asia 
 
 23 countries 
 
 Europe 
 
 20 countries 
 
 Australasia 
 
 3 countries 
 
 We were unable to get data for the USSR, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia in the 1990s 
 due to changes in the political systems in eastern Europe. We have data for the newly formed 
 countries for the latest period but no corresponding data are available before 1990. 
 Including in something of USSR in the period before 1990 and replacing is with a large number of smaller 
 countries may introduce some grouping and scale issues. So these countries are 
 left-out from the analysis. 
 Time Period: The present paper is based on results for the period 1980 to 2000. At first we 
 planned to study the 1960-2000 period, however our analysis has been restricted to this 
 shorter period since labour force data were not easily available for the years 1960-1979 from 
 the FAO or the ILO sources. These years will be included in the later stages of the 
 project when appropriate labour data is received/got.6 
 Output Series: Due to the problems of degrees of freedom connected with the use of 
 DEA methods, the present study uses two output (numbers that change/things that change), that is,, crops and animals output 
 (numbers that change/things that change). The output series for these two (numbers that change/things that change) are received/made from by collecting described/explained output 
 amount data on 185 farming-based valuable things. The following steps are used in the 
 construction of data. 
 For the year 1990, output groups are drawn from Table 5.4 in Rao (1993). These 
 groups are built using international average prices (expressed in US dollars) 
 received/made from using the Geary-Khamis method (see Rao 1993, Chapter 4 for details) for the 
 
 4 
 
 The authors are thankful to the FAO for maintaining an excellent site and for their help in making 
 valuable data series available on the internet. 
 5 
 Ordering of the countries and guesses of country shares of farming-based output are drawn from Table 3.2 in 
 Rao (1993). The original aim was to include 100 countries but three countries had to be dropped since we could 
 not build the output series for those countries. An added four countries, USSR, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia 
 and Ethiopia are dropped due to data related problems. 
 6 
 Our study period (completes/goes along with) the periods covered in some of the earlier studies, which usually cover the 60s 
 and 70s. 
 
 8 
 
 benchmark year 1990.7 This way the output series for 1990 are at constant prices, expressed in a 
 single currency unit. 
 The 1990 output series are then extended to cover the study period 1980-2000 using the FAO 
 production index number series for crops and animals separately.8 The series received/made from using 
 this approach are mostly equal to the series built using 1990 international 
 average prices and the actual amounts produced in different countries in different years. 
 Columns 3 and 4 in Tables 1 and 2 show the output groups for the 93 countries for the 
 years 1980 and 2000.9 These columns (show or prove) the differences in output mix across 
 different countries. There are many countries which are mainly producers of crops, some 
 countries are mainly animals producers and the remaining countries with a fair balance 
 between crops and animals.10 A point to note here is the idea  of output used in the study. 
 Agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with the definition of the FAO production index, the output idea  used here is 
 the output from the farm-related part/area, net of amounts of different valuable things used as feed 
 and seed.11 This is the reason for not including feed and seed in the input series. 
 Another point (related to/looking at/thinking about) the output series that is important to remember is the fact that the 
 output series are based on 1990 international average prices. So the output series would 
 change when the base is moved/changed from 1990 to another period, this way possibly influencing the 
 final results. We believe that it is more appropriate to use 1990 prices as the basis for our 
 study spanning 1980 to 2000 rather than using 1980 or 2000 international average prices. 
 Input Series: Given the restrictions on the number of input (numbers that change/things that change) that could be used in the 
 DEA analysis, we have chosen to think about/believe only six input (numbers that change/things that change). Details of these (numbers that change/things that change) 
 are given below. 
 Land: This (number or thing that changes) covers the plantable land, land under permanent crops as well as the area 
 under permanent (area of grassy land). Plantable land includes land under (lasting for a short time) crops (double-cropped 
 areas are counted only once), (lasting for a short time) large grassy areas for mowing or (area of grassy land), land under market 
 and kitchen gardens and land (for a short time) unplanted (less than five years). Land under permanent 
 crops is the land helped grow with crops that occupy the land for long periods and need not be 
 replanted after each harvest. This category includes land under flowering shrubs, fruit trees, 
 nut trees and vines but leaves out/keeps out land under trees grown for wood or timber. Land under 
 permanent (area of grassy land) is the land used permanently (five years or more) for search crops, either 
 (helped to grow) or growing wild. 
 Tractors: This (number or thing that changes) covers the total number of wheel and crawler tractors, but leaving out/keeping out 
 garden tractors, used in farming. It is important to note that only the number of tractors is 
 used as the input (number or thing that changes) with no (money given/freedom to move) made to the horsepower of the tractors.12 This 
 aspect will be examined in future work.

 The DEA method employed here is specially suited to this type of situations. The method test results 
 countries against countries with almost the same  output and input mixes. 
 11 
 The output idea  used here is agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with the idea  used in some of the earlier inter-country 
 comparison studies (see Kawagoe and Hayami (1985) and Hayami and Ruttan (1970).

 Assuming that farming in developing countries is on broken-up land, average horsepower of tractors in these 
 countries could be much lower than those used in countries with large farms using highly mechanised 
 farming ways of doing things. This could understate the working well levels and changes in developing countries.

 Labour: This (number or thing that changes) refers to (money-based)/cheaply active population in farming. (money-based)/cheaply 
 active population is defined as all people engaged or looking (for) employment in an money-based 
 activity, whether as employers, own-account workers, salaried workers or unpaid workers 
 helping in the operation of a family farm or business. (money-based)/cheaply active population in 
 farming includes all (money-based)/cheaply active people working at farm-related, forestry, hunting 
 or fishing. This (number or thing that changes) obviously overstates the labour input used in farming-based production, 
 the extent of overstatement depends upon the level of development of the country.13 
 Fertiliser: Following other studies (Hayami and Ruttan 1970, Fulginiti and Perrin 1997) on 
 inter-country comparison of farming-based working well, we use the sum of Nitrogen (N), 
 Potassium (P2O2) and Phosphate (K2O) contained in the commercial (material that makes plants grow better)s ate/destroyed. 
 This (number or thing that changes) is expressed in thousands of metric tons. 
 Animals: The animals input (number or thing that changes) used in the study is the sheep-equal of five 
 categories of animals used in building this (number or thing that changes). The categories thought about/believed are: 
 buffaloes, (cows, bulls, etc.), pigs, sheep and goats. Numbers of these animals are converted into sheep 
 equals using (changing from one form, state, or state of mind to another) factors: 8.0 for buffalo and (cows, bulls, etc.); 1.00 for sheep, goats and 
 pigs.14 Chicken numbers are not included in the animals figures. 
 Crop-watering/rinsing with water: In this study we use the area under crop-watering/rinsing with water as a substitute for the capital 
 (set of machines) connected with the crop-watering/rinsing with water of farmlands.15

 Results and Discussion 
 
 The results of our DEA and TFP calculations are summarised in this section. Given that we 
 have 21 once-a-year (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) on 93 countries, we have a lot of computer output to describe. 
 Our calculations involved the solving of 93Ã--(21Ã--3-2) = 5,673 LP problems. We have 
 thousands of pieces of information on the (wasting very little while working or producing something) scores and peers of each country in each 
 year. We also have measures of technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) change, technical change and TFP 
 change for each country in each pair of (next to) years. 
 We have because of this decided to be selective in what results we present in this paper. We provide 
 information on the means of the measures of technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) change, technical change 
 and TFP change for each country (over the 21-year sample period) and the mean changes 
 between each pair of (next to) years (over the 93 countries). We also provide means for 
 certain groups of countries and plot the TFP (moves in a particular way/becomes popular) of some selected groupings of countries. 
 In addition to this we provide a table of peers for all countries in the first year (1980) and in 
 the final year (2000).16 
 Average technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) scores in 1980 and 2000 are reported in Table 2 for the six 
 areas and the full sample. Note that the average technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) score of 0.784 in 1980 
 hints that these countries are, on average, producing 78.4 percent of the output that could 
 
 13 
 
 There could be a significant percentage of the labour force (as defined here) in disguised unemployment. 
 The (changing from one form, state, or state of mind to another) figures used in this study correspond very closely with those used in the 1970 study of 
 Hayami and Ruttan. 
 15 
 This crop-watering/rinsing with water (number or thing that changes) was not included in our previous analysis of the 1980-1995 data (see Rao and Coelli, 
 1998). In the present study we ran our DEA analysis with this (number or thing that changes) included and also left out/kept out. It was 
 interesting to note that the (unweighted) mean TFP growth increased from 1.1 percent to 1.3 percent when this 
 (number or thing that changes) was left out/kept out. This is not surprising, given that there has been significant investment in crop-watering/rinsing with water 
 (set of machines) in many countries over the past twenty years, especially in Asian countries. 
 16 
 These can obviously change from year to year, but it is not (able to be done) to present this information for every year.

 be possibly produced using the watched/followed input amounts.17 It is interesting to note that 
 those areas with the lowest mean technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) scores in 1980 - Asia and Africa - 
 also (accomplished or gained) the largest increases in mean technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) over the sample period. This 
 provides (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) of catch-up in these countries, which was not found in many of the studies 
 listed in Table 1. This is most likely because our data set spans the past two 
 20 years, while most of these studies think about/believe the 1960-1985 period. 
 This information on changes in average technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) only tells the "catch-up" part of 
 the working well story. TFP change can also appear in the form of technical change (or 
 edge of something/unexplored area-shift). The means of the measures of technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) change, technical change 
 and TFP change for each country (over the 21-year sample period) are presented in Table 4. 
 Tables 5 and 6 (match up each pair of items in order) show the unweighted and weighted once-a-year averages (averaged 
 over the 93 countries) of (wasting very little while working or producing something) change, technical change and TFP change. Table 7 shows 
 the (related to a large area) averages of changes in (wasting very little while working or producing something) and TFP. Table 8 shows the changes in TFP 
 for groups of countries classified by their technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) score in the first period 1980. 
 In Table 3 we can identify all those countries that define the edge of something/unexplored area technology for the years 
 1980 and 2000 near their watched/followed output and input mixes. The table shows that 
 there are 39 and 45 countries that are on the edge of something/unexplored area in 1980 and 2000, (match up each pair of items in order). Only 
 four countries, Niger, Indonesia, Japan and Syria, which were on the edge of something/unexplored area in 1980, were 
 no longer in the edge of something/unexplored area in 2000. Table 3 also provides a list of countries that define the best 
 practice (peers) for each of the countries that are not on the edge of something/unexplored area. It is interesting to 
 watch/notice the changes in the sets of (person who is in a similar age group or academic field) countries over the two periods. For example, in 1980 
 Cuba had Dominican Republic, Netherlands, Malaysia, New Zealand and Hungary as its 
 peers. However, in 2000 only Netherlands remained in the (related to someone within a similar age group or academic field) country set, the other 
 countries in the new set being Nigeria, Bolivia, Switzerland, Haiti and Uruguay. Sets of (related to someone within a similar age group or academic field) 
 countries defining best practice for countries in Asia seem to be staying steady over the 
 study period. 
 The last two columns of Table 3 show the number of times each of the (producing a lot with very little waste) countries on 
 the edge of something/unexplored area appear as a (person who is in a similar age group or academic field) for the technically inefficient countries. Countries that do not 
 appear as a (person who is in a similar age group or academic field) for any other country may be thought about/believed to be on the edge of something/unexplored area due to the 
 (like nothing else) nature of their input and output mix. For example Australia does not appear as a (person who is in a similar age group or academic field) 
 for any country in 1980. In contrast, Papua New Guinea appears as a (person who is in a similar age group or academic field) for 26 countries in 
 1980. 
 Table 4 shows the mean technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) change, technical change and TFP change for 
 the 93 countries over the period 1980 to 2000. Countries in the table are presented in 
 lowering/downward-moving/originating order of the importance of the TFP changes. The table shows China and Cambodia 
 as the two countries with maximum TFP growth. China shows a 6.0 percent average growth 
 in TFP, which is due to 4.4 percent growth in technical (wasting very little while working or producing something), and 1.5 percent growth in 
 technical change.18 Australia, USA and India (match up each pair of items in order) show TFP growth rates of 2.6, 
 2.6 and 1.4 percent. The unweighted average (across all countries) growth in TFP is 1.1 
 percent. 
 Tables 5 and 6 show the once-a-year average technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) change, technical change and 
 TFP change using (match up each pair of items in order) unweighted (where each country has the same weight) and 
 weighted (where each country change is weighted by the country's share in total farming-based 
 17 
 
 This figure should be understood/explained with care. No attempt has been made to (change to make better/change to fit new conditions) the data for differences in 
 climate, soil quality, labour quality, etc. 
 18 
 This result appears to be agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with some of the recent studies on Chinese money-based growth (Maddison, 
 1997).

 output). These tables show the effect of using weights on the once-a-year averages received/made from. 
 Unweighted averages show only 1.1 percent growth in TFP whereas the weighted TFP 
 growth over the period is 2.1 percent. The results show that the use of unweighted averages 
 understates the changes in TFP change and in its parts/pieces. Another hint/result/effect of this 
 difference is that TFP growth has been higher in countries with higher share of worldwide 
 farming-based output. We believe that for purposes of testing (related to a large area) and worldwide 
 performance a weighted average (across countries) of once-a-year growth rates is more 
 appropriate. 
 Tables 4 and 5 show that over the whole period there has been no (related to computers and science) moving backward 
 though for some individual years there has been some (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) of (related to computers and science) moving backward. 
 The extent of (related to computers and science) moving backward seems to be less serious when weighted average 
 changes are carefully thought about/believed. 
 Table 7 provides measures of once-a-year changes in technical (wasting very little while working or producing something), technical change and 
 TFP change by different areas. Asia as a area posted the highest TFP growth of 2.9 
 percent (mainly due to (wasting very little while working or producing something) change growth of 1.9 percent) followed by North America 
 (consisting of USA and Canada), Australasia, Europe, Africa and South America. South 
 America has posted the lowest growth rate of 0.6 percent followed by Africa with 1.3 percent 
 growth in TFP. A surprising result is that over the period 1980-2000, these results show no 
 (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) of worldwide  or (related to a large area) (related to computers and science) moving backward. This is in contrast to the work of 
 Fulginiti and Perrin (1997) who report technical moving backward in a group of 18 developing 
 countries over the period 1961-1985. Another interesting feature is the fame of 
 (wasting very little while working or producing something) change (or "catch-up") as a source of TFP growth. Both in Asia, Africa (wasting very little while working or producing something) 
 change is the principal source of TFP growth. 
 Figure 2 shows total TFP indices from 1980 to 2000 for the different areas. From the 
 figure it is obvious that Asia has the highest total growth by 2000, followed by North 
 America and Europe. Asia has a higher total growth than the worldwide  growth in TFP. 
 Africa and South America remain as the bottom groups. 
 Table 8 shows the average once-a-year changes for groups of countries classified by their 
 technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) scores in 1980. The first group, consisting of 39 countries on the edge of something/unexplored area 
 in 1980, posted only 1.2 percent growth in TFP driven by a 1.3 percent growth in technical 
 change. In contrast, those countries that had an (wasting very little while working or producing something) score between 0.6 and 1, posted a 
 1.5 percent growth in TFP mainly driven by 0.3 percent growth in technical change and 1.2 
 percent growth in technical (wasting very little while working or producing something). However the bottom group of countries, with a 
 technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) score less than 0.6, posted an impressive 3.6 percent growth in TFP 
 mainly driven by 2.5 percent growth in technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) and 1.5 percent growth in 
 technical change. These results point to/show a degree of catch-up due to improved technical 
 (wasting very little while working or producing something) along with growth in technical change.

 While the results in Tables 7 and 8 are very encouraging in terms of the catch-up and 
 coming together shown by many countries, a feature of concern is the low TFP growth 
 experienced by some countries in Africa and South America. These are the two 
 continents with the highest population growth during 1980-2000 and population in these 
 areas is projected to grow strongly in the next ten years. 
 Figure 3 summarises our guessed shadow shares received/got from the DEA edges of something/unexplored areas used in 
 figuring out/calculating the Malmquist TFP indices. Summary information on these shares is also given in 
 Tables 9 and 10. The top two series in Figure 3 represent the value shares for crops and 
 animals (both sum to togetherness) over the study period. These shares appear to be fairly steady 
 over the period, with crops accounting for more than 50 percent of the total output in most 
 years. 
 The six series graphed at the bottom of Figure 3 represent the shadow input shares resulting 
 from the use of the DEA way(s) of doing things. The figure serves to (show or prove) the 
 believability of the input shares received/made from here. The labour share shows a steady decline from 
 28.5 percent in 1980 to 24.2 percent in 2000. The share of land, grouped over all the 
 countries, seems to be quite stable around 11 percent. While the share of tractors remained 
 the same, the shares of fertilisers and animals have shown small increases. 
 Table 10 shows the country-clearly stated/particular output and input shares hidden (under) the TFP indices 
 reported here. These shares are averaged over the study period 1980 to 2000. These shadow 
 shares seem to be quite meaningful. For example, India shows 71 percent share for crops and 
 29 percent for animals confirming the importance of crops in India. (in almost the same way), in the 
 Netherlands the share of animals is shown to be 97.1 percent. Almost the same  animals shares are 
 shown for Norway (99.4 percent), Switzerland (95.1 percent) and Finland (96.6 percent).

 The last six columns of Table 10 show the shares of the six inputs. These shares also appear 
 to be meaningful and agreeing with/matching up with/working regularly with the general factor gifts enjoyed by these 
 countries. For example, the shadow shares of labour are quite high in countries like the USA 
 (64.1 percent), Canada (53.9 percent) and Australia (58.6 percent). Labour shares are also 
 quite high in those countries where labour is plentiful and farming is very labour 
 intensive. India and Indonesia (match up each pair of items in order) have shadow labour shares of 44.5 and 42.2 
 percent (match up each pair of items in order). In countries where land is a limiting factor its shadow share is quite 
 high. For example, in the Netherlands the land share is 27.7 percent. In Japan and Israel the 
 land shares are (match up each pair of items in order) 56.4 and 47.2 percent. These large shares for land also reflect the 
 lack of land resulting from increasing urbanisation of farming-based land. 
 Shares of other factors, including fertilisers, tractors, animals and crop-watering/rinsing with water, are also 
 reasonable and appear to support the general scarcities of these useful things/valuable supplies in different countries. 
 We find the general (popular things/general ways things are going) in these shares over time and differences across countries appear 
 to support the discussion in Ruttan (2002) where different restrictions to working well growth in 
 world farming are identified. Table 11 summarises the shadow share information by 
 continents. The Asian continent has the highest input share connected with land whereas 
 North America and Europe have large shares for labour, animals and crop-watering/rinsing with water inputs. 
 As one final exercise, we have taken the average shadow share guesses from the bottom of 
 Table 11 and used them as fixed shares in the calculation of Tornqvist TFP index numbers 
 for each country. These Tornqvist TFP indices are reported in Table 12, along with the 
 original Malmquist TFP indices from the final column of Table 4. The differences between 
 these two columns of indices are reported in the final column of Table 12. This table has 
 been sorted by the size of this difference. The reported differences are quite large in some 
 
 14 
 
 cases, with 40 countries reporting differences of 1 percent per year or more. These 
 differences may be (gave reasons for something) in two ways. Either the shadow shares for some countries are 
 not well guessed (due to the quality problem in DEA) or the shadow shares are well 
 guessed, but they differ significantly from the sample average, because of country specific 
 factors, such as land (not enough of something), labour (oversupply/large quantity), etc. For many countries, the watched/followed 
 difference may well be a combination of these two factors, to different degrees. 
 Finally, the country-level information in Table 12 is summarised in Table 13 for our six 
 areas. The largest difference happens for South and Central America, where the average 
 TFP growth measure increases from 0.6 percent to 1.5 percent per year. This is not a 
 minor difference, and focuses the key point that TFP indices depend importantly upon the 
 prices that are used - be they market prices or shadow prices.

 Ends/end results 
 
 This paper presents some important findings on levels and (moves in a particular way/becomes popular) in worldwide  farming-based 
 working well over the past twenty years. The results presented here examine the growth in 
 farming-based working well in 93 countries over the period 1980 to 2000. The results show an 
 once-a-year growth in total factor working well growth of 2.1 percent, with (wasting very little while working or producing something) change (or 
 catch-up) adding/giving 0.9 percent per year and technical change (or edge of something/unexplored area-shift) providing 
 the other 1.2 percent. There is little (event(s) or object(s) that prove something) of the (related to computers and science) moving backward discussed in a 
 number of the papers listed in Table 1. This is most likely a result of the use of a 
 different sample period and an expanded group of countries. In terms of individual country 
 performance, the most amazing performance is posted by China with an average once-a-year 
 growth of 6.0 percent in TFP over the study period. Other countries with strong performance 
 are, among others, Cambodia, Nigeria and Algeria. The United States has a TFP growth rate 
 of 2.6 percent whereas India has posted a TFP growth rate of only 1.4 percent. 
 Turning to performance of different areas, Asia is the major performer with a once-a-year TFP 
 growth of 2.9 percent. Africa seems to be the weakest performer with only 0.6 percent 
 growth in TFP. Examining the question of catch-up and coming together, we find that those 
 countries that were well below the edge of something/unexplored area in 1980 (with technical (wasting very little while working or producing something) coefficients of 
 0.6 or below) have a TFP growth rate of 3.6 percent. This in contrast to a low 1.2 percent 
 growth for the countries that were on the edge of something/unexplored area in 1980. These results point to/show a degree of 
 catch-up in working well levels between high-performing and low-performing countries. We 
 find these results to be quite interesting since these point to/show an encouraging reversal (during 
 1980-2000 period) in the big thing/the important event of negative working well (popular things/general ways things are going) and (related to computers and science) 
 moving backward reported in some of the earlier studies for the period 1961-1985. 
 Though the results are quite reasonable and meaningful, the authors are quite aware of the 
 data limits and the need for further work in this area. Future work should include: (i) an 
 examination of the strength of the results to moves/changes in the base period for the computation of 
 output groups; (ii) including bug-killers, herbicides and (bought something for money) feed and seed in 
 the input set; (iii) an (act of asking questions and trying to find the truth about something) of the effects of land quality, crop-watering/rinsing with water and rainfall; and 
 (iv) use of parametric distance functions to study the strength of the findings to the 
 choice of way(s) of doing things.
