 Abstract 
 This paper reviews some idea-based issues having to do with the (putting into) use of an clear "(related to space or existing in space)" (way of seeing things / sensible view of what is and is not important) in 
 applied econometrics. It provides an summary of the reason for including (related to space or existing in space) effects in moving backward models, both from a 
 explanation-driven as well as from a data-driven (way of seeing things / sensible view of what is and is not important). (large/relatively large) attention is paid to the guess-related (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) necessary 
 to carry out guess and testing and the different ideas (you think are true), restrictions and effects/results/suggestions deeply set within  the different 
 (detailed descriptions of exactly what is required) available in the books. The review combines ideas from the usual (related to space or existing in space) econometrics books as 
 well as from geostatistics, biostatistics and medical image analysis.

 1. Introduction 
 The last few years have seen a virtual explosion in the 
 application of (related to space or existing in space) models in a range of fields in the 
 social sciences in general, and in applied money flow/money-based studies in 
 particular (recent reviews are given in, e.g. Anselin and 
 Bera, 1998; Goodchild et al., 2000; Anselin, 2001b,c). 
 Over time, the way(s) of doing things of (related to space or existing in space) econometrics 
 (Paelinck and Klaassen, 1979; Anselin, 1988) has matured and changed from an aspect of (related to space or existing in space) statistics 
 with first (or most important) application in (related to a large area) science and (related to careful studying or deep thinking) (the study of (or the location of) mountains, rivers, hills, etc.) (Ord, 1975; Cliff and Ord, 1981), 
 to an more and more visible thread in formal econometric explanation (for example, Conley, 1999; Kelejian and 
 Prucha, 1999, 2001; Baltagi and Li, 2001; Lee, 2002). 
 (in almost the same way), when dealing with group thin sliceal 
 data in scientific work, testing for (related to space or existing in space) autocorreE-mail address: anselin@uiuc.edu (L. Anselin). 
 
 lation and guessing models that formally includes (related to space or existing in space) effects is no longer (excellent/very unusual). Probably, 
 (related to space or existing in space) moving backward ways of doing things are beginning to become 
 part of the toolbox of applied econometrics. In farming-based and useful thing/valuable supply money flow/money-based studies, drawings/pictures of this 
 (way of seeing things / sensible view of what is and is not important) can be found in Benirschka and Binkley 
 (1994), Bockstael (1996), Weiss (1996), Nelson and 
 Hellerstein (1997), Bell and Bockstael (2000), Florax 
 et al. (2001), Hurley et al. (2001), Anselin et al. (2002), 
 Irwin and Bockstael (2002), Kim et al. (2002) and Roe 
 et al. (2002), among others. 
 While definitely large amounts of progress has been 
 made, most applications of (related to space or existing in space) econometrics are 
 rather limited in the way in which (related to space or existing in space) interaction 
 is included in the model (detailed descriptions of exactly what is required). The typical approach is to tell the difference between (what people commonly call a/not really a) (related to space or existing in space) lag and (related to space or existing in space) error models (see Anselin, 1988). 
 The former incorporate a (related to space or existing in space)ly fell behind dependent

 model. (related to space or existing in space) error autocorrelation is either modeled 
 directly, following the general ways of thinking/basic truths/rules of geostatistics, or by using a (related to space or existing in space) autoregressive process 
 for the error term (for a recent review of these models, 
 see Anselin and Bera, 1998; Anselin, 2001b). What 
 is not always well understood in this process is that 
 different (related to space or existing in space) models cause sometimes totally 
 different (related to space or existing in space) relationship patterns, which do not 
 necessarily match the hidden (under) possible interaction model. 
 In this paper, I review some issues in the (detailed description of exactly what is required) and (understanding/ explanation) of (related to space or existing in space) moving backward models. 
 The goal is to pull together results from a variety 
 of fields of study in which different modeling plans 
 have been chased after, including (related to space or existing in space) econometrics, 
 biostatistics, medical image analysis and geostatistics. 
 The review is aimed at a general audience of applied 
 econometricians, without assuming (state of knowing someone or something well) with 
 (related to space or existing in space) econometrics. Because of this, the approach taken is 
 mostly teaching-related and mostly a reformulation and 
 description of ideas that have been organized and listed in some 
 form in earlier review papers (specifically, Anselin 
 and Bera, 1998; Anselin, 2001b,c, 2002). The focus throughout is less on technical aspects than on 
 the hidden (under) ideas and gut feeling. The goal 
 is to highlight unusual results and suggest added/more 
 ways in which (related to space or existing in space) models may be introduced in 
 applied econometrics. A more technical treatment is 
 chased after in a companion paper. 
 The focus of the paper is only on (related to space or existing in space) relationship in linear moving backward models, leaving 
 the discussion of (related to space or existing in space) mixed-up nature aside.1 Also, 
 space-time models and (related to space or existing in space) panel (detailed descriptions of exactly what is required) are 
 not thought about/believed clearly, although most of the structures thought about/believed can be done in a space-time 
 big picture  without change. 2 
 The rest of the paper consists of four sections 
 and a end/end result. First, possible reasons for the 
 including in something of (related to space or existing in space) dependence in a moving backward model 
 are carefully thought about/believed. This is followed by a almost the same  focus 
 on data-driven (desires to do things/reasons to do things). Next, some con1 For a general review of approaches to model (related to space or existing in space) mixed-up nature in a moving backward big picture, see, among others, Anselin (1988, 
 1990), Casetti (1997), Fotheringham et al. (1998) and LeSage 
 (2002). 
 2 See for example Elhorst (2001) for a recent review of some 
 of the issues, and Anselin (1988, 2001b), for the (detailed description of exactly what is required) of 
 (related to space or existing in space) panel data models. 
 
 ceptual issues are reviewed that relate to the foundations for (related to studying numbers) guessing in (related to space or existing in space) moving backward models, including data models, the construction of (related to space or existing in space) 
 weights and asymptotics. Finally, some comments are 
 created on the issue of (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) moving backward, (in other words) 
 the use of (related to space or existing in space) moving backward models to group together units, such as counties or states. 
 
 2. Explanation-driven (detailed descriptions of exactly what is required) 
 Including (related to space or existing in space) effects in applied econometric models is usually (gave a reason to do something) either on possible grounds, following from the formal (detailed description of exactly what is required) 
 of (related to space or existing in space) interaction in an money-based model, or on 
 practical grounds, due to weird qualities of the data used 
 in an scientific analysis. I think about/believe the possible 
 (way of seeing things / sensible view of what is and is not important) first. 
 In their description of the definition of (related to space or existing in space) 
 econometrics, Paelinck and Klaassen (1979) stressed 
 the importance of (related to space or existing in space) (dependent on each other), the unevenness of (related to space or existing in space) relations, and the relevance of factors 
 located in "other spaces". This early creation 
 of the importance of (related to space or existing in space) interaction was mostly 
 based on practical grounds. However, more (not very long ago), these concerns are also reflected in possible 
 money-based models of interacting agents and social 
 interaction. Such models deal with questions of how 
 the interaction between money-based agents can lead to 
 newly-seen total behavior and group patterns, 
 and they assign a central role to location, space and 
 (related to space or existing in space) interaction. The (enough to be meaningful) ideas receive 
 different labels in different subfields, such as social 
 normal behaviors, neighborhood effects, (group of same-age people) effects, respect, (related to a plan to reach a goal) interaction, copy-catting, yardstick competition and race to the bottom, to name 
 a few. However, an important (something in common) is the 
 need to formally specify the range and strength of 
 the relations between the interacting agents, which in 
 scientific practice translates into the need to specify 
 a structure for (related to space or existing in space) relationship. 
 Examples of such possible (solid basic structures on which bigger things can be built) in money flow/money-based studies are models of complex behavior built on 
 ways of thinking/basic truths/rules from (related to studying numbers) mechanics, such as interacting particle systems and random field models (Brock 
 and Durlauf, 1995; Akerlof, 1997; Durlauf, 1997); 
 macroeconomic models with mean field interaction 
 (Aoki, 1996); models for neighborhood spillover

 effects (Durlauf, 1994; Borjas, 1995; Glaeser et al., 
 1996); and models of increasing returns, path dependence and (not totally pure/not totally correct) competition hidden (under) the new 
 money-based (the study of (or the location of) mountains, rivers, hills, etc.) (Fujita et al., 1999). 
 Rather than providing a described/explained review of how 
 specific (related to space or existing in space) econometric models follow from these 
 possible (things to carefully think about), I will first focus on two 
 especially interesting forms that have seen (large/relatively large) use in practice: (related to space or existing in space) reaction functions 
 and possible (numbers that change/things that change). Next, I present some statements 
 on (related to space or existing in space) hidden/covered up (number or thing that changes) models. 
 
 (connected/related) in a situation where a farmer would decide/figure out 
 the amount of farmland gave/reserved to a crop by taking 
 into account the amounts gave out by the other farmers in the system. As a result, the unemotional function 
 for each agent is: 
 
 2.1. (related to space or existing in space) reaction function 
 
 The (related to space or existing in space) lag model (1) is an (putting into) use of 
 the reaction function received/got by specifying a linear 
 functional form for R and by restricting the set of interacting agents to the "neighbor" structure expressed 
 in the (related to space or existing in space) weights W . Even though this (forces (on people)/causes an inconvenient situation) 
 a large number of zero restrictions in W in the (related to what holds something together and makes it strong) form (1), the similar reduced form shows/tells about 
 a worldwide  range of spillovers: 
 
 A (related to space or existing in space) reaction function (Brueckner, 2002) expresses how the importance of a decision (number or thing that changes) for 
 an money-based agent depends on the high levels of the 
 decision (numbers that change/things that change) set by other money-based agents.3 This 
 provides the possible basis for a (what people commonly call a/not really a) (related to space or existing in space) 
 lag model, or, mixed backwards-moving, (related to space or existing in space) autoregressive 
 model (Anselin, 1988): 
 y = ÏWy + XÎ² + Îµ, 
 
 (1) 
 
 where, as usual, y is an nÃ--1 vector of (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) on 
 the dependent (decision) (number or thing that changes), W is an n Ã-- n (related to space or existing in space) weights matrix that (agrees to--and promises to follow--certain rules, procedures, etc.) the network structure (nodes and links) of the social network of the n 
 agents,4 Ï is the (related to space or existing in space) autoregressive limit/guideline, X 
 is an n Ã-- k matrix of (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) on the (coming from the outside of something) 
 (numbers that change/things that change), with an connected k Ã-- 1 moving backward coefficient vector Î², and Îµ is a vector or random error 
 terms. 
 Brueckner (2002) develops two possible (solid basic structures on which bigger things can be built) for (related to a plan to reach a goal) interaction that produce a reaction 
 function as the balance solution. One is referred 
 to as a spillover model, in which an agent i chooses 
 the level of a decision (number or thing that changes), yi , but the values of 
 the y chosen by other agents (say,ya'i , where the a'i 
 subscripts refers to all agents other than i) affect its 
 unemotional function also. For example, this would be 
 3 Brueckner (2002) develops his argument in the big picture  of 
 public money flow/money-based studies and refers to the "agents" as "controls," 
 which are the decision-making agents in this setting. Here, I will 
 use the more general term agents. See also Section 5 for a discussion of the (understanding/ explanation) of reaction functions when the units are 
 groups of agents, which is an important honor/difference. 
 4 A more formal treatment of the (related to space or existing in space) weights is delayed 
 until Section 4.2. 
 
 U (yi , ya'i ; xi ), 
 
 (2) 
 
 with xi as a row vector of ((coming from the outside of something)) (features/ qualities/ traits) 
 of i. The solution to the usual goal (biggest increase/best possible extent) 
 problem yields the reaction function as: 
 yi = R(ya'i , xi ). 
 
 y = (I a' ÏW )a'1 XÎ² + (I a' ÏW )a'1 Îµ, 
 
 (3) 
 
 (4) 
 
 in which the "Leontief inverse" (I a' ÏW )a'1 links the 
 decision changeable yi to all the xi in the system through 
 a (what people commonly call a/not really a) (related to space or existing in space) multiplier. Also, (4) shows how the (thing that changes (like a test score) because of something else that you control (like study time)) yi at i is serious and stubborn 
 by the error terms at all locations in the system, and 
 not just the error at i. This (happening at the same time) makes the 
 (related to space or existing in space)ly fell behind Wy variable endogenous, which requires/results in (made to do one thing very well) guess ways of doing things, such as 
 maximum chance guess or instrumental (numbers that change/things that change) approaches (see, e.g. Ord, 1975; Anselin, 1988; 
 Kelejian and Robinson, 1993; Kelejian and Prucha, 
 1998). 
 The particular form of the (related to space or existing in space) multiplier in 
 (4) is only one example out of a (system for classifying living things) of models for (related to space or existing in space) spillovers, as presented in Anselin 
 (2002). Different ranges for the (related to space or existing in space) spillovers can 
 be incorporated by applying the (related to space or existing in space) lag operator 
 (pre-multiplication by the (related to space or existing in space) weights matrix W ) to 
 the y, X or Îµ terms in a moving backward (detailed description of exactly what is required). However, it is important to note that models that include 
 Wy all cause a worldwide  form of spillovers. Local forms 
 of spillover are received/got from (related to space or existing in space) falls behind  for the explanatory (numbers that change/things that change) (WX, see Section 2.2) and particular error covariances, such as those caused by a (related to space or existing in space) 
 moving average model and a (related to space or existing in space) error parts/pieces model (see Anselin, 2002; Anselin and Moreno, 
 
 250 
 
 L. Anselin / Farming-based Money flow 27 (2002) 247-267 
 
 2002). These do not seem to fit the (related to a plan to reach a goal) interaction 
 (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built). 
 Brueckner (2002) shows how a number of scientific computer programs of (related to a plan to reach a goal) interaction models are 
 special cases of his spillover model, with applications 
 to state expenses, pollution stopping and other 
 forms of yardstick competition.5 
 A second possible (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) is referred to as 
 the useful thing/valuable supply flow model. Here, the agent's decision 
 (number or thing that changes) is not directly affected by the levels chosen 
 by other agents, but only indirectly. The indirect effect 
 follows from the presence of the value of a "useful thing/valuable supply" 
 in the individual agent's unemotional function: 
 U (yi , si , xi ), 
 
 (5) 
 
 where si is the amount of the useful thing/valuable supply available to 
 agent i. For example, this could relate to a farmer's 
 decision of how much crop-watering/rinsing with water to apply to a field, 
 where the useful thing/valuable supply si would be the amount of water available for this purpose. The interaction between 
 agents follows from the way in which the useful thing/valuable supply is 
 distributed among them, which depends both on the 
 (features/ qualities/ traits) of each agent (xi , for example, the type 
 of crop grown on the field), as well as on the decisions 
 taken by the other agents (how much water they use): 
 si = H (yi , ya'i ; xi ). 
 
 (6) 
 
 After substituting (6) into (5), the interaction (numbers that change/things that change) ya'i become part of the unemotional function, and 
 the resulting balance solution takes the same form 
 as the reaction function (3) for the spillover model. 
 Brueckner (2002) shows how a number of tax competition and other (related to a plan to reach a goal) interaction models fall in 
 the useful thing/valuable supply flow category and so also suggest a (related to space or existing in space) lag (detailed description of exactly what is required).6 
 It is important to note that the spillover and the useful thing/valuable supply flow models both lead to the same (related to space or existing in space) lag 
 econometric (detailed description of exactly what is required). Put differently, the (related to space or existing in space) 
 econometric model as such is not (good) enough to identify 
 the money-based (machine/method/way) that leads to the presence 
 (and evidence) of (related to space or existing in space) interaction. This is 
 an example of the inverse problem, which is widespread 
 5 Familiar examples are Case et al. (1993), Besley and Case 
 (1995), Murdoch et al. (1997), and Bivand and Szymanski (1997, 
 2000). 
 6 Examples are Brueckner (1998) and Saavedra (2000), among 
 others. 
 
 in (related to space or existing in space) data analysis (see, for example, Chiles and 
 Delfiner, 1999, Chapter 8). A almost the same  problem is already-met in the (understanding/ explanation) of a (related to space or existing in space) lag model 
 as the expression of a (related to space or existing in space) diffusion process.7 While 
 diffusion processes will lead to balance results 
 that are compatible with a (related to space or existing in space) lag (detailed description of exactly what is required), 
 other processes may produce the same result also. 
 In other words, these different processes are (in a way that relates to watching and noticing something) equal. 
 The (basic, built-in, important qualities/scent) of the problem is that a single crosssectional data set contains not enough information to 
 identify the exact nature of the hidden (under) (machine/method/way). This is only one example of the kinds of identification problems met in (related to space or existing in space) econometric 
 models, as shown by Manski (1993) and Kelejian and 
 Prucha (1997), among others.8 
 2.2. Potential (numbers that change/things that change) 
 A potential (number or thing that changes) formally expresses the importance of "other spaces" in a moving backward (detailed description of exactly what is required). 
 The possible reason for this goes back to the 
 early treatment of (related to space or existing in space) interaction in the (related to a large area) 
 science books by Isard (1960). There, the potential 
 for interaction between an origin i and all destinations 
 j was created as a sum of "mass" terms in the 
 destination, suitably downscaled by a distance decay 
 function. Specifically, with zj as a measure of mass 
 (e.g. income, population size) and f (dij ) as a distance 
 decay function, the potential at i becomes: 
 Pi = 
 
 f (dij )zj . 
 
 (7) 
 
 j 
 
 Note that the destinations need not be the same as the 
 origins for this idea  to work, although they usually are.9 Commonly used distance (rotted, inferior, or ruined state) functions 
 7 See, for example, the discussion in Baller et al. (2001) and 
 Messner and Anselin (2002). 
 8 In point pattern analysis, this identification problem is referred 
 to as the problem of true against/compared to/or seen/obvious sickness. In a nutshell, 
 the information in a thin slice is not (good) enough to distinguish 
 between clustering as resulting from a (able to be caught from other people) process, or 
 clustering as a result of (related to space or existing in space)/structural mixed-up nature (for details, 
 see, among others, Upton and Fingleton, 1985; Cressie, 1993). 
 9 For example, in Anselin et al. (1997) a (number or thing that changes) is included 
 that incorporates the effects of counties surrounding an MSA, as 
 a "ring" (number or thing that changes), whereas those counties are not part of the data 
 set for the (thing that changes (like a test score) because of something else that you control (like study time)). 
 
 L. Anselin / Farming-based Money flow 27 (2002) 247-267 
 
 are the negative huge, f (dij ) = ea'Î³ dij , and the 
 a'Î³ 
 inverse distance function, f (dij ) = dij .10 
 A idea  related to idea of a (possible greatness or power) is  the (related to space or existing in space) cross-backwards-moving term or (related to space or existing in space)ly fell behind explanatory (number or thing that changes) (WX), discussed in Florax and Folmer 
 (1992). Such a (number or thing that changes) consists of a weighted sum of 
 values at other locations, or, for each (instance of watching, noticing, or making a statement) i: 
 [Wx]i = 
 
 wij xj , 
 
 (8) 
 
 j =i 
 
 where the importance of each link i-j is expressed in 
 the weights. The weights are perfectly general, and can 
 include the distance (rotted, inferior, or ruined state) (detailed descriptions of exactly what is required) given above. 
 Usually, they are based on (land-area-based/location) closeness of 
 the units of (instance of watching, noticing, or making a statement). The non-zero elements in 
 the ith row of W decide/figure out the range of interaction 
 that affects location i, or, the range of (related to space or existing in space) spillover. 
 In contrast to the (related to space or existing in space)ly fell behind (thing that changes (like a test score) because of something else that you control (like study time)) that follows from the (related to space or existing in space) reaction function, 
 the (related to space or existing in space) cross-backwards-moving term does not suggest a 
 multiplier effect. Whether its range is worldwide (including all other (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements)) or local (limited to 
 a few "neighbors") depends on the (detailed description of exactly what is required) of 
 the (related to space or existing in space) weights, that is, on the extent to which 
 zero restrictions (of the form wij = 0) have been 
 (forced (on people)/caused an inconvenient situation). 
 In a moving backward (detailed description of exactly what is required), the same (numbers that change/things that change) may 
 be included in non-fell behind and (related to space or existing in space)ly fell behind form, 
 as in 
 y = XÎ² + WXÎ³ + Îµ, 
 
 (9) 
 
 where zero restrictions can be forced on specific 
 elements of the limit/guideline vectors Î² and Î³ . Also, 
 when both the original values (xk ) and the (related to space or existing in space) lag 
 (Wxk ) for the same (number or thing that changes) are included, tests for 
 the importance of distance (rotted, inferior, or ruined state) can be performed 
 (distance (rotted, inferior, or ruined state) hints Î³k &amp;lt; Î²k ). Finally, in contrast 
 to the (related to space or existing in space) lag model, the (related to space or existing in space) cross-backwards-moving 
 (detailed description of exactly what is required) does not require (made to do one thing very well) guess 
 methods and ordinary least squares remains fair 
 for Î³ . 
 10 The limit/guideline Î³ is either guessed together with the other limits/guidelines of the model, which turns it into a non-linear (detailed description of exactly what is required), or set good. Common choices in the inverse distance model 
 are the integers 1 and 2, the last thing just mentioned following from the Newtonian 
 gravity model. See Isard (1960), for an long/big discussion.

 2.3. (related to space or existing in space) hidden/covered up (number or thing that changes) models 
 So far, the possible models thought about/believed were created for a continuous (thing that changes (like a test score) because of something else that you control (like study time)) y. In applied econometrics, a more related (detailed description of exactly what is required) often 
 has to do with separate (things that change (like test scores) because of other things that you control (like study times)), where only 
 a limited number of values are watched/followed, such as the 
 presence or (not being there; not being present) of an action, or whether one out 
 of a small number of different decisions has been 
 taken. The standard approach to modeling such things is to develop a (detailed description of exactly what is required) for an unseen 
 hidden (under) hidden/covered up (thing that changes (like a test score) because of something else that you control (like study time)) for each agent, 
 say yia-- . The link between the hidden/covered up (number or thing that changes) and the watched/followed separate thing/event is received/got by specifying 
 a dividing line, say c, such that yi is watched/followed whenever 
 yia-- &amp;gt; c. A typical computer program of this approach is in 
 (related to space or existing in space) land use models, where only the result is watched/followed (one out of a set of separate land use decisions), 
 but the decision process is related to a hidden/covered up (number or thing that changes), 
 such as a money-making state, in a random utility (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built). 
 A (related to space or existing in space) hidden/covered up changeable model is a (detailed description of exactly what is required) for 
 this process where (related to space or existing in space) relationship is introduced between the decision (numbers that change/things that change) and/or in the error structure of the model. As a familiar point of departure, 
 think about/believe a hidden/covered up linear moving backward model, where the 
 unseen (thing that changes (like a test score) because of something else that you control (like study time)) yia-- is related to a 1 Ã-- k 
 row vector of explanatory (numbers that change/things that change) xi and an error 
 term Îµi : 
 yia-- = xi Î² + Îµi . 
 
 (10) 
 
 A matching (related to space or existing in space) lag model would then be 
 y a-- = ÏWya-- + XÎ² + Îµ, 
 
 (11) 
 
 or, equally: 
 yia-- = Ï 
 
 j =i 
 
 wij yja-- + xi Î² + Îµi , 
 
 (12) 
 
 where y a-- is the full n Ã-- 1 vector of the hidden/covered up (things that change (like test scores) because of other things that you control (like study times)). Note that this is compatible with a 
 (related to space or existing in space) reaction function for the hidden/covered up (numbers that change/things that change), but 
 not necessarily for the watched/followed separate results. In 
 other words, it is the hidden/covered up Wya-- that is present in the 
 actors' unemotional functions, such as Eq. (2), but not the 
 watched/followed Wy. For example, this would suggest that it is 
 the unseen a money-making state of the neighbors parcels 
 that enters in the utility function of a (related to space or existing in space) land use 
 model, but not the watched/followed actual land uses.

 The matching reduced form of the hidden/covered up (related to space or existing in space) lag 
 process is as in (4), but again having to do with the vector 
 of hidden/covered up (numbers that change/things that change): 
 y a-- = (I a' ÏW )a'1 XÎ² + (I a' ÏW )a'1 Îµ, 
 
 (13) 
 
 or 
 y a-- = (I a' ÏW )a'1 XÎ² + u, 
 
 (14) 
 
 where u = (I a' ÏW )a'1 Îµ. 
 For simpleness, let the dividing line c = 0 and let yi 
 be binary, taking on the value of 1 whenever yia-- &amp;gt; 0. 
 From (13), it follows that: 
 yia-- = 
 
 j 
 
 aij xj Î² + ui , 
 
 (15) 
 
 where aij is the element (i, j ) of the Leontief inverse 
 matrix (I a' ÏW )a'1 , and ui = 
 j aij Îµj . The summary over j hints that yia-- is serious and stubborn not only 
 by xi , but also by all the other xj in the system, and 
 not only by Îµi , but by the other error terms Îµj in the 
 system also. 
 The separate changeable yi is watched/followed whenever yia-- &amp;gt; 
 0 in (15), or 
 j 
 
 aij xj Î² + ui &amp;gt; 0. 
 
 (16) 
 
 For a matching random changeable ui , this yields the 
 familiar condition 
 Prob[yi = 1] = Prob[ui &amp;lt; gi (X, W, Î², Ï)]_), 
 
 (17) 
 
 where gi = 
 j aij xj Î² depends on X, W , Î² and 
 Ï. Note that in (17), ui is not i.i.d. as in the usual 
 (non-(related to space or existing in space)) model, but is a random (number or thing that changes) whose 
 not important distribution is serious and stubborn (in part) by the covariance matrix of the multivariate random vector u. 
 In the case of a standard (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) Îµi , (in other words) for a (related to space or existing in space) probit model, the random vector u will be multivariate (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) with a covariance matrix Cov[u] = 
 [_((I a'ÏW ) (I a'ÏW )]a'1 . An important result of 
 this complex covariance structure is that the not important 
 ui will be heteroskedastic. This makes standard probit guess (not agreeing/not happening in the same way). Also, due to the 
 high degree of covariance, it is necessary to integrate 
 out the n a' 1 other random (numbers that change/things that change) in order to get the not important distribution for each individual ui . 
 Note that when Îµi does not follow a (usual/ commonly and regular/ healthy) distribution, the changed multivariate random (number or thing that changes) 
 
 (I a' ÏW )a'1 Îµ is not necessarily well defined. For example, this is the case for a logit (detailed description of exactly what is required) and for 
 models of counts (Poisson models), where the resulting multivariate (detailed description of exactly what is required) is uncontrollable/uncurable. 
 The (basic, built-in, important qualities/scent) of the problem is again the (happening at the same time) 
 of the yia-- , which prevents an easy solution such as 
 ï£® 
 ï£¹ 
 Prob[yi = 1] = Prob ï£°Îµi &amp;lt; Ï 
 j =i 
 
 wij yja-- + xi Î² ï£» . 
 (18) 
 
 This expression is not operational, since the yja-- that 
 enter in the (state where two things are not the same) condition are not watched/followed, and 
 are themselves figured out by/decided by yia-- . 
 This (happening together) model differs from a (may or may not happen, depending on something) approach, in which either yj or Prob[yj = 1] 
 are (assumed to be) (capable of being seen and known). An hint/result/effect of the 
 (may or may not happen, depending on something) approach is that the (related to space or existing in space) pattern of the 
 yj cannot be explained by the model. In other words, 
 in order to be operational, a (may or may not happen, depending on something) model needs/demands 
 that the values of the yj for the neighbors are received/got 
 separately from the (related to space or existing in space) model (12). More importantly, the two approaches are not equal, a point 
 sometimes lost in the (understanding/ explanation) of results received/got 
 in scientific practice. 
 A clear/separate advantage of the (may or may not happen, depending on something) approach is 
 that standard guess ways of doing things can be applied, as 
 long as the (related to space or existing in space) lag term can be inserted as an (capable of being seen and known) on the right hand side of the condition (18). In 
 practice, this can be done by a wise (related to space or existing in space) resampling (group-related sampling of non-touching 
 groups), although this usually involves a big 
 loss of information.11 In contrast, the complex difficulty of the 
 multivariate interactions in (17) makes worthless standard 
 probit or tobit ways of doing things and needs/demands (made to do one thing very well) guess and tests. This is still very much an active 
 area of research. Some suggestions have been 
 created, such as the use of the expectation, (biggest increase/best possible extent) (EM) approach (McMillen, 1992), general 
 method of moments (GMM) guess (Pinkse and 
 Slade, 1998), and (testing out) estimators, such as recursive importance sampling (Vijverberg, 1997; Beron 
 11 For example, if (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) usually have four neighbors, 
 the effective sample size in a non-touching subsample would 
 be one-fourth of the original sample size. This loss of degrees of 
 freedom will result in a lower quality of the guesses, limiting 
 this approach in practice to very large data sets.

 and Vijverberg, 2002) and the Gibbs sampler (LeSage, 
 2000).12 
 
 3. Data-driven (detailed descriptions of exactly what is required) 
 In practice, the reason for applying a (related to space or existing in space) 
 econometric model is usually not driven by formal 
 possible concerns, but instead is a result of data 
 "problems". For example, the scale and location of the 
 process under study does not necessarily match the 
 available data, such as when farming-based land markets 
 are studied with data at the county level. This (existence of two things that aren't equal in size, power, color, etc.) will tend to result in model error structures that 
 show a planned (related to space or existing in space) pattern. Also, explanatory 
 (numbers that change/things that change) are often "built" by (related to space or existing in space) figuring out to make their scale compatible with that of the 
 (thing that changes (like a test score) because of something else that you control (like study time)). Again, this (related to space or existing in space) (statement about the future) will 
 tend to result in (statement about the future) "errors" that show planned (related to space or existing in space) difference/different version. This problem is commonly met in models where money-based results are 
 related to (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) or useful thing/valuable supply (numbers that change/things that change), such 
 as air or water quality. (related to space or existing in space)ly group measures 
 of the last thing just mentioned are figured out/calculated by figuring out measures 
 received/got for a small set of watching stations, whose 
 locations do not occur with those of the money-based 
 agents. Another often already-met situation is when 
 data on important (numbers that change/things that change) are missing, and those 
 (numbers that change/things that change) show (related to space or existing in space) structure, as is often the case in 
 studies of (related to areas near the Equator/hot and humid) land use and (chopping down trees). A common (feature/ quality/ trait) of these data problems is that the 
 error term in a moving backward model will tend to be (related to space or existing in space)ly related.13 
 In contrast to explanation-driven models, which can be 
 referred to as dealing with (enough to be meaningful) (related to space or existing in space) relationship, the relationship in the error models is referred 
 to as a annoyance. From a technical viewpoint, the limits/guidelines used in the (detailed description of exactly what is required) of the structure of 
 12 
 
 A review of guess issues in (related to space or existing in space) hidden/covered up (number or thing that changes) models 
 is contained in Fleming (2002). Testing for (related to space or existing in space) autocorrelation 
 in probit and tobit models is carefully thought about/believed in Kelejian and Prucha 
 (2001) and Pinkse (2002). 
 13 This relates not only to the error terms in classical linear 
 moving backward models, but extends to generalized linear models (such 
 as Poisson moving backward models) and generalized (something added to food, or something else) models 
 (e.g. models for rates) also. Examples can be found in Gotway 
 and Stroup (1997), Waller et al. (1997a,b), Best et al. (1999), 
 Lawson (2001), MacNab and Dean (2002), among others. 
 
 253 
 
 the (related to space or existing in space) relationship can therefore often be thought about/believed to be annoyance limits/guidelines, which helps guess in some events.14 The main goal of the 
 econometric exercise is to get fair/consistent 
 and (producing a lot with very little waste) guesses for the moving backward limits/guidelines 
 in the model (Î²), while taking into account the (related to space or existing in space) 
 structure incorporated in the error covariance matrix. 
 Formally, the main interest is in the familiar moving backward model: 
 y = XÎ² + Îµ, 
 
 (19) 
 
 where the error covariance matrix, Cov[ÎµÎµ ]_), or, equally, E[ÎµÎµ ]_), specifies (related to space or existing in space) covariance when the 
 off-diagonal elements are non-zero, E[Îµi Îµj ]_) = 0 (for 
 i = j ), obeying a given "(related to space or existing in space) ordering" 
 (Kelejian and Robinson, 1992). Specific forms for the 
 covariance structure are either specified directly (in 
 (what people commonly call a/not really a) direct representation models) or follow from 
 a (related to space or existing in space) (random/including random data points) process model (such as a (related to space or existing in space) 
 autoregressive or (related to space or existing in space) moving average model). 
 3.1. (related to space or existing in space) filtering 
 An interesting (way of seeing things / sensible view of what is and is not important) in the big picture  of (related to space or existing in space) relationship as a annoyance is the (what people commonly call a/not really a) (related to space or existing in space) filtering approach. Almost the same as  first differencing 
 for time series, one can think about/believe a form of (related to space or existing in space) differencing.15 However, unlike the time series 
 case, for row-(made something look or work the same way every time) (related to space or existing in space) weights, the first 
 differencing leads to amazingness, since Ï = 1 is outside the proper limit/guideline space. For general, not 
 row-(done or made to look the same way every time) weights the limit/guideline space is usually held back to values much smaller than 1, 
 so that (unscaled) first differencing is (in almost the same way) not 
 allowed. 
 More formally, a (related to space or existing in space) first difference can be expressed as: 
 y a' Wy = (X a' WX)Î² + u, 
 
 (20) 
 
 or, 
 (I a' W )y = (I a' W )XÎ² + u. 
 
 (21) 
 
 Since the row elements of W sum to 1, the matrix 
 (I a' W ) is amazing/single. Instead of using a "pure" first 
 14 
 15 
 
 For a review of the econometric issues, see Lancaster (2000). 
 For some early examples, see Martin (1974) and Getis (1995). 
 
 254 
 
 L. Anselin / Farming-based Money flow 27 (2002) 247-267 
 
 difference, a (related to space or existing in space) autoregressive limit/guideline must be 
 included, as in 
 (I a' ÏW )y = (I a' ÏW )XÎ² + u. 
 
 (22) 
 
 The operation where a vector (or matrix) of data is 
 pre-multiplied with the matrix expression (I a' ÏW ) 
 is called a (related to space or existing in space) filter. Further pre-multiplying both 
 sides of the equation by (I a' ÏW )a'1 yields 
 y = XÎ² + (I a' ÏW )a'1 u, 
 
 (23) 
 
 which is equal to a model with a (related to space or existing in space)ly autoregressive error term: 
 Îµ = (I a' ÏW )a'1 u, 
 
 (24) 
 
 (I a' ÏW )Îµ = u, 
 
 (25) 
 
 Îµ = ÏW Îµ + u. 
 
 (26) 
 
 In other words, specifying a (related to space or existing in space) autoregressive 
 process for the error term is equal to carrying 
 out a standard moving backward on (related to space or existing in space)ly filtered (numbers that change/things that change). However, unlike the time series case, the (related to space or existing in space) autoregressive limit/guideline cannot be gotten from 
 a plain/honest/easy extra/helping (thing) moving backward, but guess 
 must be carried out together with that of the other model 
 limits/guidelines. As a result, the (related to space or existing in space) filter is mostly a 
 convenient (understanding/ explanation), but not a solution to the guess problem. 
 Almost the same as  the approach taken in (12), the (related to space or existing in space) lag 
 model (1) can be expressed as a (related to space or existing in space) filter also. 
 However, the filter only has to do with the left hand side 
 of the equation, as in 
 (I a' ÏW )y = XÎ² + u. 
 
 (27) 
 
 This can be understood/explained as a way to clean the dependent 
 (number or thing that changes) y of the effects of (related to space or existing in space) relationship, while 
 maintaining the "correct" (i.e. consistent and (producing a lot with very little waste)) 
 guesses for Î². However, as in the (related to space or existing in space) error model, 
 it is not possible to guess the limit/guideline Ï separately 
 from the other limits/guidelines of the model, so that there 
 is no gain in the guess. More than that, model (27) 
 relates mistakes from a (related to space or existing in space) mean in y to levels for 
 X, which may not be appropriate in many contexts. It 
 should only be thought about/believed as a last resort, when there 
 is no (enough to be meaningful) basis for a lag model, but strong 
 evidence in its favor, such as pointed to/showed by the 
 results of model (figuring out problems). Usually, however, other 
 problems, such as scale (existence of two things that aren't equal in size, power, color, etc.), a poor selection 
 
 of the weights and more serious misspecifications are 
 likely to be the criminal and should be thought about/believed before 
 resorting to an (understanding/ explanation) of the lag model as a 
 (related to space or existing in space) filter. 
 
 4. Guess-related (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) 
 In this section, I review some issues that are almost never 
 made clear in applied work, but that are basic 
 for the (related to studying numbers) guessing in (related to space or existing in space) econometrics. 
 Three aspects in particular are carefully thought about/believed: the data 
 model hidden (under) the (related to studying numbers) analysis, the choice of 
 (related to space or existing in space) weights and distance (rotted, inferior, or ruined state) functions, and the 
 asymptotic approach toward guessing. 
 4.1. Data model 
 In his classic text, Cressie (1993) outlines a (system for classifying living things) for (related to space or existing in space) (related to studying numbers) analysis, distinguishing 
 between point pattern analysis, geostatistical models and (what people commonly call a/not really a) (something made of crossed strips of wood, metal, etc.) or (related to a large area) models. In point 
 pattern analysis, the main interest focuses on the 
 location of the (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) as such, and whether 
 this suggests clustering or other non-random patterns. Since point pattern analysis is almost never used in 
 money-based analysis, it will not be further thought about/believed 
 here.16 Instead, the focus is on the difference between the geostatistical and (something made of crossed strips of wood, metal, etc.) approaches and 
 the contexts in which they are appropriate in applied 
 econometrics. 
 The basic difference between the geostatistical and (something made of crossed strips of wood, metal, etc.) approaches can be related to the idea of a data model from the computer data base 
 and (land-area-based/location) information science literatures. A data 
 model is an idea of reality in a form agreeable 
 for analysis by a computer. In dealing with (related to space or existing in space) 
 data, the basic honor/difference is between objects and fields 
 (Goodchild, 1992).17 
 Objects are separate things/businesses and are usually represented in a (land-area-based/location) information systems (GIS) as 
 points, lines and polygons (in a (what people commonly call a/not really a) vector GIS). 
 16 Apart from Cressie (1993), early complete reviews of 
 point pattern statistics are given in Ripley (1981), Diggle (1983) 
 and Upton and Fingleton (1985). A "modern" approach, based on 
 Bayesian (related to certain things being ranked above or below other things) modeling is organized and listed in Wolpert and Ickstadt 
 (1998), Ickstadt and Wolpert (1999) and Best et al. (2000). 
 17 See also Egenhofer et al. (1999) for a recent summary. 
 
 L. Anselin / Farming-based Money flow 27 (2002) 247-267 
 
 In money-based analysis, these objects go along with/match up to money-based agents or "controls," with separate locations 
 in space, such as addresses, (official count of everyone who lives in a country, city, etc.)  areas and counties. 
 In contrast, fields relate to continuous (related to space or existing in space) distributions, represented as surfaces (in a (what people commonly call a/not really a) raster 
 GIS). In money-based analysis, one can picture fields 
 as price or risk surfaces, for example in the study of 
 land values, crop yields or air quality. 
 Sometimes it is not immediately obvious whether 
 an object or field approach is more appropriate. For 
 example, land values could be studied as (features/ qualities/ traits) of separate (related to space or existing in space) objects (parcels) or could 
 be viewed as samples from a continuous land value 
 surface. (in almost the same way), location-clearly stated/particular yield measures 
 in a quality farm-related computer program could be imagined as samples from a continuous yield surface, or (using other choices), be connected with a regular 
 (something made of crossed strips of wood, metal, etc.) overlaid on the field. The effects/results/suggestions of the 
 choice of (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) for (related to studying numbers) guessing are farreaching. 
 Of the two, the object view and connected (something made of crossed strips of wood, metal, etc.) 
 data (way of seeing things / sensible view of what is and is not important) seem to be more natural for the study 
 of separate money-based agents, and is the one usually 
 connected with (related to space or existing in space) econometrics. However, unlike 
 "standard" econometric analysis, the (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) in a 
 (related to space or existing in space) analysis of objects are no longer a representative sample from a population of objects. Instead, they 
 consist of a single data point on the complete (related to space or existing in space) 
 pattern among them. 
 For example, a thin sliceal data set on money-based 
 (numbers that change/things that change) for US states is not a sample from a population of imaginary states, but its (related to space or existing in space) pattern (e.g. 
 as shown by a map for state incomes) is a single (instance of watching, noticing, or making a statement) from all the possible (random/including random data points) patterns that 
 an hidden (under) (machine/method/way) may create. In order to 
 carry out (related to studying numbers) guessing, an idea of a superpopulation or (related to space or existing in space) random process is needed/demanded (e.g. a 
 Markov random field, MRF). This assumes the existence (mentally) of a (random/including random data points) process that may 
 create many possible (related to space or existing in space) patterns, of which the 
 watched/followed data is one. The goal of the analysis is 
 then to show the (related to space or existing in space) process by means of 
 the watched/followed (related to space or existing in space) pattern. Both a (related to space or existing in space) lag and 
 a (related to space or existing in space) error (detailed description of exactly what is required) can be changed something (to help someone)/took care of someone in 
 this (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built). 
 Some unusual features of this approach are 
 worth pointing out. Since the complete (related to space or existing in space) pattern 
 is the (instance of watching, noticing, or making a statement) in (something made of crossed strips of wood, metal, etc.) models, missing values 
 
 255 
 
 are hard to deal with.18 In other words, a fully filled 
 out space must be watched/followed, without any "holes". For 
 example, in the analysis of land values or crop yields 
 for parcels in a area, this would require that all the 
 parcels in the area are watched/followed. 
 Also, usually, the (related to space or existing in space) units (such as US states) 
 are touching and exhaust the space, so that an idea 
 of figuring out is silly/not doable. For example, it would 
 be hard to imagine (describing the future) for a "state" in between 
 Kansas and Colorado. Instead, (related to space or existing in space) (statement about the future) applies to prediction, or the use of a model 
 guessed from the watched/followed (related to space or existing in space) pattern to another 
 set of (related to space or existing in space) units, outside the watched/followed set, or for a 
 different time period. 
 In a (something made of crossed strips of wood, metal, etc.) approach, (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) can be viewed as 
 nodes on a network, with links between them pointing to/showing the friendliness between nodes. This representation is very general, and easily extends beyond a pure 
 (land-area-based/location) setting to money-based and social networks 
 (e.g. Friedkin, 1998). It needs/demands the formal (detailed description of exactly what is required) of the network structure, which is used 
 by means of (related to space or existing in space) weights (see Section 4.2). 
 A (a) little different case happens where a sample 
 of separate units is watched/followed, each with a (connected/related) 
 set of "neighbors," as in some group-related sample designs. For example, this may happen for a data set of 
 land use by parcel, where each (instance of watching, noticing, or making a statement) is matched 
 to its nearest neighbors. While almost the same as  the (something made of crossed strips of wood, metal, etc.) 
 setup, an important honor/difference is that the values for 
 the neighbors are assumed known, and the pattern for 
 the neighbors themselves is not explained. More exactly, the (may or may not happen, depending on something) distribution of land uses, (may or may not happen, depending on something) upon that watched/followed for the neighbors is being 
 modeled, not the combined distribution of all the land uses 
 in the system. This important honor/difference was also met in the discussion of (related to space or existing in space) hidden/covered up (number or thing that changes) 
 models. 
 When the data model is a field, a geostatistical 
 (way of seeing things / sensible view of what is and is not important) is appropriate, since it views the (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) as sample points from a continuous surface. The 
 goal of a geostatistical analysis is to guess  the 
 (related to space or existing in space) distribution for the surface from information 
 18 Note that this has to do with a classical (related to studying numbers) analysis. In a 
 Bayesian viewpoint, both data and limits/guidelines are carefully thought about/believed to 
 be random, so that missing values can be incorporated in the same 
 way as unseen limit/guideline values. A review of issues relating 
 to "data enlargement," although without treating (related to space or existing in space) aspects 
 of the issue can be found in Tanner (1996).

 given by the pairwise association between the 
 sample points, expressed as a function of the distance 
 that separates them (for long/big reviews, see, among 
 others, Cressie, 1993; Goovaerts, 1997; Chiles and 
 Delfiner, 1999; Stein, 1999). 
 The geostatistical (way of seeing things / sensible view of what is and is not important) is a natural (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) when dealing with an incomplete set of (related to space or existing in space) 
 (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements), where the goal is to (describe the future) values 
 for unseen locations. This focus on (related to space or existing in space) figuring out (kriging), is a (having a unique quality) (feature/ quality/ trait) of 
 geostatistics, and differs from the focus on guess and guessing in the (something made of crossed strips of wood, metal, etc.) (way of seeing things / sensible view of what is and is not important). For applied econometric work, it is important to note that in 
 a geostatistical approach to (related to space or existing in space) moving backward models, 
 the main interest therefore lies in best (statement about the future) 
 (rather than guess), using (for selfish reasons) (related to space or existing in space) patterns 
 in the error term. In a geostatistical approach, there is 
 no direct partner to a (related to space or existing in space) lag model or (related to space or existing in space) 
 reaction function. 
 An added aspect of the geostatistical (way of seeing things / sensible view of what is and is not important) is that the choice of the number and location of 
 sample points becomes part of the analysis, in contrast 
 to the (something made of crossed strips of wood, metal, etc.) (way of seeing things / sensible view of what is and is not important), where the locations are given 
 and fixed. The best design of (related to space or existing in space) sampling networks is a topic that is receiving increasing attention, 
 especially in the area of (related to surrounding conditions or the health of the Earth) watching.19 
 In applied work, it is important to select the proper 
 data model for the analysis. Mostly, this boils down 
 to telling a difference between a design consisting of 
 separate objects and a design that is created as 
 a sample from a continuous (related to space or existing in space) surface. In many 
 applications in applied econometrics, the last thing just mentioned is (not made by nature/fake) when it comes to modeling money-based agents. 
 However, when the set of (related to space or existing in space) (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) is incomplete (i.e. with missing values or holes in the layout), the geostatistical/field approach is the only one 
 that remains internally consistent. Also, a combined form 
 is possible, when some of the explanatory (numbers that change/things that change) 
 are "figured out" from a geostatistical model, but the 
 model itself has to do with separate agents, leading to a 
 (related to space or existing in space) errors in (numbers that change/things that change) (detailed description of exactly what is required) (see Anselin, 
 2001c). 
 The contrast between the two data models is summarized in Table 1. 
 19 Some recent reviews of the important issues can be found in 
 Arbia and Lafratta (1997), Muller (1998), and Wikle and Royle 
 (1999), among others.

 4.2. (related to space or existing in space) weights 
 A basic problem in the analysis of (related to space or existing in space) 
 relationship in a pure thin sliceal setting is the lack 
 of identification of the limits/guidelines of the complete 
 covariance matrix. The covariance matrix contains 
 n possibly different variance terms Ïi2 as well as 
 n(n a' 1)/2 off-diagonal terms Ïij (= Ïji , since the 
 covariance matrix is matching). Clearly, a single 
 thin slice of n (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) contains not enough 
 information to allow for the guess of the individual variance-covariance terms. Asymptotics do 
 not help, since the problem gets worse as the sample size grows (an (unplanned/minor event) limit/guideline problem). In 
 sum, it will be necessary to force (on people) a structure on 
 the variance-covariance and to express it as a function of a small number of respected limits/guidelines. In 
 (related to space or existing in space) moving backward analysis, this is approached from 
 two main opinions, matching the data models 
 organized and listed in Section 4.1. In a geostatistics-clever 
 approach, the covariance is specified directly as a 
 function of the distance between pairs of (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements). Different (detailed descriptions of exactly what is required) for this distance decay 
 function have been employed, but most are some 
 version of a negative huge model. Examples 
 and a discussion of guess and identification 
 issues can be found in Cook and Pocock (1983), 
 Mardia and Marshall (1984), Dubin (1988, 1992), 
 Dubin et al. (1999), and Anselin (2001a), among 
 others. 
 In contrast, using an object view and corresponding (something made of crossed strips of wood, metal, etc.) model, the covariance structure follows indirectly from the (detailed description of exactly what is required) of the (related to space or existing in space) weights 
 matrix that underlies a (related to space or existing in space) process model (Markov 
 random field). Different (detailed descriptions of exactly what is required) for the weights

 and their results are reviewed in the rest 
 of this section. 
 Before going ahead with this, it is worthwhile to 
 briefly think about/believe a third way of very big structure, referred to in the books as (related to space or existing in space) error parts/pieces. 
 The full covariance structure follows from rotting the error term into parts/pieces and forcing (on people) a 
 model for the variance and covariance of these terms. 
 This approach is common in (related to certain things being ranked above or below other things) and multilevel modeling, where one error part is association with a model for (excess) mixed-up nature and 
 the other with a model for (related to space or existing in space) difference/different version, following the suggestion of Besag et al. (1991). Examples 
 of including (related to space or existing in space) random effects in (related to certain things being ranked above or below other things) Bayesian models in biostatistics are reviewed 
 in, among others, Waller et al. (1997a,b) and Best 
 et al. (1999). Applications using a multilevel modeling 
 (solid basic structure on which bigger things can be built) are illustrated in Langford et al. (1999a,b), 
 Leyland et al. (2000) and Leyland (2001). Error parts/pieces were introduced in (related to space or existing in space) econometric (detailed descriptions of exactly what is required) by Kelejian and Robinson (1995).20 
 Formally, the (related to space or existing in space) weights matrix is an n Ã-- n 
 positive matrix (W ) which specifies "neighborhood 
 sets" for each (instance of watching, noticing, or making a statement). In each row i, a non-zero 
 element wij defines j as being a neighbor of i. By 
 convention, an (instance of watching, noticing, or making a statement) is not a neighbor to itself, 
 so that the diagonal elements are zero (wii = 0). Note 
 that this definition is much wider than the term 
 neighbor suggests. In most applications in applied 
 econometrics, the neighbors are touching (related to space or existing in space) 
 units, as in Fig. 1, but this can be easily generalized 
 to any network structure. For example, in Fig. 2, 
 the six (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) are nodes on a network and the 
 existence of a neighbor relation matches the links between the nodes.21 The layouts in both Figs. 1 and 2 
 yield the same 6 Ã-- 6 (related to space or existing in space) weights matrix, illustrated 
 on the left hand side of Table 2 (from Anselin and 
 Smirnov, 1996). This is usually referred to as a binary 
 closeness matrix, since the weights are set to one for 
 neighbors, and zero for others. For ease of (understanding/ explanation) and to make the limit/guideline guesses between 
 different models more similar, the (related to space or existing in space) weights

 matrix is usually row-(made something look or work the same way every time), as shown on 
 the right hand side of Table 2. Each element in the 
 (done or made to look the same way every time) matrix, wijs = wij / j wij , is between 
 0 and 1, which hints that a (related to space or existing in space) lag operation 
 (pre-multiplying a vector of (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements) by W ) goes along with an averaging of the close-by values.22 
 The (detailed description of exactly what is required) of the weights matrix is a matter of some randomness and is often referred to as a major 
 weakness of the (something made of crossed strips of wood, metal, etc.) approach. A range of suggestions have been offered in the books, based on closeness, distance, as well as more general numbers.23 
 Some issues related to the (detailed description of exactly what is required) of 
 (related to space or existing in space) weights require (lots of serious thought) in practice. First, even when the weights are based on simple

 Note that the resulting matrix is no longer matching, since 
 wij = i wji , which needs to be accounted for in the computations of maximum chance guesses.

 closeness, different weights structures may result for 
 the same (related to space or existing in space) layout. In the classic example of a regular square grid layout, the options are referred to as 
 the rook case (only common edges), the church supervisor 
 case (only common highest points) and the queen case (both 
 edges and highest points). Depending on the judging requirement 
 chosen, a location will have either four (rook, church supervisor) 
 or eight (queen) neighbors on average (apart from edge 
 effects). This hints quite different covariance structures for the connected random processes. Even in irregular (related to space or existing in space) layouts, a decision must be made as to 
 whether units that only share a common highest point should 
 be thought about/believed to be neighbors (queen) or not (rook). 
 In practice, the construction of the neighbor structure of irregular (related to space or existing in space) units is based on the digital 
 edge files in a GIS. Sloppiness in the storage 
 of the polygons and highest points can cause problems in 
 this respect, cooperating with/producing/giving up "islands" or other unexpected 
 friendliness structures when getting/taking the (related to space or existing in space) arrangement from these edge-related files.24 
 A second type of problem happens when the (related to space or existing in space) 
 weights are based on a distance judging requirement, such that 
 two units i and j are defined as neighbors when the 
 distance between them (or, for areal units, the distance 
 between their centroids) is less than a given critical 
 value. When there is a high degree of mixed-up nature 
 in the (related to space or existing in space) distribution of points or in the areas of 
 areas, there may be no acceptable critical distance. 
 In those events, a "small" distance will tend to produce 
 a lot of islands (or, unconnected (instances of watching, noticing, or making statements)). Also, a 
 24 In GIS words/word choices, the polygons should be "clean" before the 
 topology can be "built". 
 
 distance chosen to make sure that each unit has at least one 
 neighbor may result in an unacceptably large number 
 of neighbors for the smaller units. 
 In scientific applications, this problem is already-met when building distance-based (related to space or existing in space) weights for 
 US counties (western counties have much larger areas 
 than eastern counties) or city-based  (official count of everyone who lives in a country, city, etc.)  areas (core
