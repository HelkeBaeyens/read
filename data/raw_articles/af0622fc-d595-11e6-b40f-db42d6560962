Abstract
A survey of two rural markets in southwest Nigeria over 14 months showed that supplies, sales and prices of sheep and goats varied
widely during the period with a sharp peak during the Muslim festival of Eid-e1-Kabir and a smaller peak during the Christmas-New Year
period. Local West African Dwarf (WAD) sheep and goats and northern Y' ankasa sheep and Red Sokoto goats were traded in the markets
and animals were purchased for rearing, trading, ceremonies, butchering/ catering, sacrifice, and festivals. There were significant differences
between species /breeds purchased for various purposes. A hedonic price model was fitted to determine factors influencing price. After
adjustments were made for age, weight, sex, time of transaction and market, WAD sheep commanded higher prices than WAD goats and
Red Sokoto goats for all purposes except for butchering/ catering; Red Sokoto goats commanded similar or lower prices than WAD goats
depending on the purpose for purchase; and Y'ankasa sheep, principally purchased for the Eid-el-Kabir festival, commanded marginally
higher prices than WAD sheep. The market share of WAD sheep is currently small and is under competition from northern sheep and goats,
so increased production of WAD sheep in the south will benefit both producers and consumers in the area. In general, the results indicate
that buyers have preferences for specific breeds and species for specific purposes, so producers and sellers may benefit by targeting specific
buyer categories and times of the year. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

1. Background and objectives
Trypanotolerant West African Dwarf (WAD)
sheep and goats are the most common ruminant
species kept by small-scale crop farmers in the humid zone of west and central Africa. Of the 19.8
million small ruminants in the zone, over 60% are
WAD goats (Mcintire et al., 1992). Nearly half of
the small ruminants of humid zone are found in
Nigeria (Jahnke, 1982). As the aggregate demand for
small ruminant meat in the zone exceeds supply
from local sources, the gap is met by supplies from
the subhumid and semiarid zones in the north of the
country and beyond. In the past, only southern urban
markets used to be served by northern animals but in
recent years, northern animals have started penetrat0169-5150/98/$17.00 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

ing southern rural markets, and the share of northern
animals in the southern markets has been increasing.
Principally, Red Sokoto goats and Y'ankasa sheep
are exported to the southern markets, and more goats
than sheep are exported (Francis, 1990; Jabbar, 1995).
Of all the animals traded in the southern rural
markets, only a few are purchased by local villagers
for rearing, some are bought by traders to resell live
or as meat and most of the animals are bought by
different types of consumers for ceremonies and
festivals, e.g., birth, marriage, funeral, sacrifice,
Christmas and Eid-el-Kabir (Sandford, 1982; Francis, 1990; Jabbar, 1995). It is common among Christians, Muslims and animists in the region to offer to
sacrifice an animal if a wish is fulfilled, e.g., if a sick
person gets well. Normally, the meat of the sacrifi-

22

cial animal is distributed among poor neighbours.
Muslims also sacrifice animals on the occasion of
Eid-el-Kabir (also called Eid-el-Adha) festival to
commemorate prophet Ibrahim's (prophet Abraham
in Christian religion) response to god's wish to
sacrifice his son to prove his commitment, love and
loyalty to god. Since Muslims follow lunar calendar,
this occasion moves forward by 10-11 days every
year.
Earlier market and price surveys in southern
Nigeria have generally shown that supplies, sales and
prices of small ruminants peak at festival times and
that the price of a particular species /breed depends
on animal attributes such as weight, sex, time of
sale, location of market (Okali, 1979; Okali and
Upton, 1985; Francis and Ingawa, 1988; Francis,
1990; Jabbar, 1995). These studies have also shown
that nominal prices of southern species /breeds were
lower than that for northern species /breeds but in
the absence of appropriate adjustments for animal
characteristics like age, weight and sex, the price
comparisons may not reflect true differences. Moreover, these studies did not consider the possibility of
any significant price differences between animals
purchased for different purposes. Andargachew and
Brokken (1993) have found significant price differences between small ruminants purchased for different purposes in the Ethiopian markets.
The objectives of this paper are to determine if
buyers of small ruminants in southern Nigeria have
systematic preferences for specific species /breeds
for specific purposes, and whether they pay significantly different prices for different species /breeds
consistent with their preferences. Answers to these
questions have important implications for the local
and northern producers who supply the southern
markets. Any significant price differences by
species /breeds, purpose and time of purchase would
mean that producers and sellers could benefit by
targetting specific buyer categories and times of the
year to sell their animals.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Source of data
Two rural markets-Oja and Apomu-were
monitored in Oyo state, southwest Nigeria. Oja is

located about 10 km outside Oyo town, and Apomu,
about 35 km away from lbadan, a large city. These
markets are functionally independent in the sense
that their supply hinterlands and service areas are
largely different. Both are general commodity markets, a section of which is used for trading small
ruminants. Both the markets normally meet every 4
days, and more frequently before major festivals
such as Christmas and Eid-el-Kabir. Data were collected each market day from the buyers and the
sellers of all the animals traded except that during
festival periods when large number of animals were
traded, records of a random sample of animals were
taken. Data were collected for the period December
1989 to January 1991. During this period, the two
markets met for a total of 223 days and records were
collected of 4504 traded animals.
For each traded animal, data were collected on
price, species, breed, sex, age (months), live weight
(kg), seller type, seller sex, buyer type, buyer sex,
reason for sale, reason for purchase or intended use
of the animal. Animals are not normally weighed by
buyers and sellers in the market but an ability by
either side to make a good guess about weight helps
in making a good bargain. However, for the purposes
of this study, each traded animal was weighed on a
scale immediately after the buyer and the seller
reached an agreement to exchange. Age was measured by examining teeth and by consulting the seller
and the buyer. Some general characteristics of this
sample were reported earlier (Jabbar, 1995) and the
results of more rigorous price analysis are presented
in this paper.
2.2. Analytical method

A hedonic price model was used to determine the
effects of various factors on price. A hedonic price
function relates the price of a product (good or
service) to its various attributes or characteristics.
Waugh (1928) and later Lancaster (1971) made early
attempts to relate price to product characteristics.
Rosen (1974) and Lucas (1975) advanced those ideas
providing a theoretical framework for hedonic price
analysis. The underlying hypothesis of such analysis
is that products have utility bearing attributes and
that the values of those attributes contribute to the
price of the product. The observed product price is

M.A. Jabbar /Agricultural Economics 18 (1997) 21-30

therefore a composite of the implicit values of the
product's attributes.
The theory of hedonic pricing offers no suggestion concerning the functional form governing the
relationship between price and different attributes,
this is considered a matter for empirical determination (Williams, 1989). The theoretical framework
suggested by Rosen (1974) assumes competitive
market structure where consumers' bid functions and
suppliers' offer price functions are always tangential
at the equilibrium. So hedonic price function is
essentially a function of product attributes and not of
individual buyer and seller attributes (Oczkowski,
1994). This means that only products are differentiated, while their markets, buyers and sellers are not.
In most empirical studies, however, linear regression
models have been used with product as well as
market and market agent attributes as variables implying the existence of elements of noncompetitiveness in the relevant product market being investigated (see for example, Brorsen et al., 1984; Francis,
1990; Parker, 1993; Parker and Zilberman, 1993;
Andargachew and Brokken, 1993; Williams et al.,
1993; Oczkowski, 1994; Rodriguez et al., 1995).
Most hedonic regression models use a set of
quantitative (continuous) variables, a set of qualitative (discrete) variables in the form of dummies, and
in some cases a set of interaction variables. For
quantitative variables in the regression, the respective partial derivative of the function represents the
implicit marginal attribute price. For qualitative variables, the estimated coefficient measures the impact
of the presence of the given attribute. In this case,
the implicit (predicted) price cannot be derived from
a partial derivative but requires additional manipulation (Gujarati, 1988). In models with many qualitative attributes each with several categories requiring
many dummy variables and numerous interaction
terms, the number of terms in the equation may
. become large. In such cases, the estimation of the
predicted prices becomes cumbersome and at times
difficult to interpret and compare (see for example,
Francis, 1990; Andargachew and Brokken, 1993;
Rodriguez et al., 1995).
An alternative is to use Analysis of Covariance
(AnCov) technique which is a combination of linear
regression and analysis of variance (ANOVA). In the
AnCov technique, the ANOVA results are adjusted

23

for the linear relationships between the dependent
variable and the covariates (Norusis, 1993). The
general explicit form of the AnCov model may be
written as: P = F(Q,C) + U, where P is the observed price of a product, Q is a set of factors
(qualitative variables) each with more than one categories, C is a set of covariates (quantitative variables), and U is a residual error term. Relevant
interaction terms may be optionally included in the
model. The estimated parameters of the model can
be used to estimate the adjusted mean prices of
different categories of a product, e.g., male and
female sheep: adjusted prices are estimated prices if
both male and female were of the same attributes. In
a multifactor, multicovariate model, the parameters
for categories of a factor are estimated by adjusting
the effects of all other factors and the covariates.
With simultaneous or joint confidence intervals generated by the model, the significance of differences
of the parameters of different categories of a factor
can be compared (Norusis, 1993; Gujarati, 1988). In
principle, linear regression and AnCov techniques
perform the same function but slightly differently.
The principal advantage of AnCov results is that
they can be interpreted more directly and easily to
compare differences between categories of a factor.
In this study, the AnCov technique was employed
using the General Factorial Analysis of Variance
procedure of SPSS for Windows to estimate parameters (Norusis, 1993). The factors and covariates used
are discussed in Section 3.2.

3. Results
3.1. General characteristics of the data
Of the 4504 animals traded in the two markets,
69% were WAD goats, 9% WAD sheep, 21% Red
Sokoto goats and 1% were Y' ankasa sheep (Table
1). There were a small number of Red Kano goats
and Balarni sheep from the north which were respectively combined with Red Sokoto goats and Y'ankasa
sheep in this analysis. Of all the animals, 76% were
sold by farmers from the surrounding areas of the
two markets, and 26% by traders. Of all the traded
animals, 24% were purchased by farmers for rearing,
27% by traders for resale in the same or other rural

markets or in the urban markets, 16% by butchers
and catering restaurants, 20% by consumers for various ceremonies, 10% by consumers for different
festivals and 3% by consumers for sacrifice.
Traders are an important category of market agents
who are more experienced and skilled than any other
type of buyer or seller in evaluating the product
quality attributes of each animal. They are also
skilled in assessing the true value of an animal and
the value a specific type of buyer or seller may put
on the animal. These knowledge and skill primarily
influence the margin they are able to derive from
each transaction.
Some traders in the sample markets bought local
animals from the farm gate or at the market for
resale in the market while other traders brought
northern animals from terminal urban markets in
Oyo and Ibadan. Some local traders maintained stalls
at the market where few animals were kept on
non-market days to meet the emergency needs of
local buyers. Transactions during non-market days
were not monitored in this study. During a market
day, a buyer or a seller, particularly a trader, could
be involved in multiple transactions-buying/selling
several animals or buying and reselling the same
animal the same day. It was difficult to keep track of
such multiple transactions. Since records of all individual transactions were kept, a trader involved in

multiple transactions was recorded as a buyer in one
transaction and a seller in another.
There are significant differences between species
and breeds purchased for different purposes (Table
1). The sample markets being rural with supply
hinterland for WAD sheep and goats, traders would
be normally expected to sell but not purchase
Y' ankasa sheep and Red Sokoto goats of the north,
and this was indeed the case. Ninety percent of the
Y' ankasa sheep were purchased by consumers for
the Christmas and Eid-el-Kabir festivals for which
Red Sokoto goat was also preferred to WAD sheep
and goats. WAD goat was the favourite animal for
sacrifice, butchering and catering but Red Sokoto
goat was the predominant animal used for ceremonies such as funerals, births and marriages.
A large number of animals are traded around the
times of festivals. Supplies and sales of animals
peaked in June-July coinciding with the Muslim
festival of Eid-el-Kabir. A smaller peak in December
coincided with the Christmas-New Year festivals.
Supplies built up over the few weeks prior to Eidel-Kabir in July. Actual supplies in June-July 1990
accounted for 55% of total supply for the year with
July alone accounting for 43% of the total supply for
the year. Out of the total July supply, 73% were on
offer on three market days within 10 days prior to
Eid-el-Kabir. During the whole 14 months period

25

M.A. Jabbar /Agricultural Economics 18 ( 1997) 21-30

supply per market per day averaged 74 animals but
supply averaged 117 and 47 animals respectively
during peak festival periods (June-July, DecemberJanuary) and other normal months. Northern animals
constituted 40-50% of daily supplies during the
peak festival periods and 20-28% of the daily supplies during other months. This indicates that northern suppliers primarily target festival related markets
in the south.
Observed age and live weight of the traded animals are shown in Table 2. Overall, Y' ankasa sheep
were the oldest and heaviest animals while WAD
goats were the lightest. Females were older and
heavier than males. Among various end uses, animals bought for rearing and sacrifice were younger
and lighter than those bought for trading, ceremonies, festivals and butchering/catering. Buying
younger and lighter animals for rearing would be
expected but buying younger and lighter animals for

sacrifice indicates that when satisfying god in the
spirit of sacrifice, size of the animal is perhaps not
important. Animals traded during June-July were of
higher average weight than those traded during other
months. This was primarily because heavier northern
animals were traded in June-July for the Muslim
festival of Eid-el-Kabir. It may be noted that Eid-elKabir occurs 10-11 days sooner every year due to
the lunar cycle, but whenever it occurs, larger animals would be normally purchased.
3.2. Determinants of price

Several models were fitted to assess the effects of
different factors on the price per animal. The results
of the best performing models are presented in Table
3. In the overall model run with the entire sample,
age, age square, live weight and live weight square
were used as covariates while purpose of purchase,

species /breed, sex, market and month of purchase
were used as factors. In order to test whether differences in species/breed preferences for specific purposes were also reflected in price differences, interactions between purpose of buying and
species /breed, sex and market were introduced in
the overall model. But because certain
species/breeds were not purchased for some pur-

poses and in some cases very few were purchased,
several cells in the data matrix were empty. In this
case, the model estimated the coefficients of the
interaction terms assuming those empty cells as null
or zero values but the hypothesis being tested in this
way was not the hypothesis of interest to this study
(see, Norusis, 1993, for an explanation of the implication of estimating parameters assuming zero for

were fitted to animals purchased for specific purposes, using relevant factors and categories.
In the overall model, the specified covariates and
factors explain 77% of the variation in price per
animal but in the purpose specific models, the explanatory power varies from 68% for animals purchased for ceremonies to 84% for animals purchased
for rearing (Table 3). Among the covariates, age and
live weight have significant relationship with price
but the magnitudes vary in purpose specific models.

Except in the case of festival, the coefficient of live
weight is greater than that for age. For festival, age
is a more important variable than weight (actually
the coefficient of weight is not statistically significant) because for the Muslim festival of Eid-el-Kabir,
animals below certain age are not suitable for slaughter.
The negative effect of age square, significant in
all cases except for rearing, trading and butchering,
indicate that less premium is paid for older animals.
The average age of animals purchased for rearing is
low with a small range which perhaps explains why

28

M.A. Jabbar /Agricultural Economics 18 (1997) 21-30

the coefficient of age square of this group is not
significant. The sign of weight square is positive in
the overall model and for rearing, butchering and
festival, indicating that price increases at an increasing rate as animals get heavier, though this relationship is significant only in the case of festival, indicating higher premium is paid for heavier animals
slaughtered for festival. For trading, ceremonies and
sacrifice, the negative sign of weight square indicates
that less premium is paid for heavier animals, particularly those purchased for trading and ceremonies.
Other things being equal, the results also show the
following.
(a) In the overall model, traders, butchers/ caterers
and consumers purchasing for ceremonies paid significantly lower prices and those purchasing for festivals paid higher prices than prices paid by farmers
for rearing, which was used as the base category.
Traders and butchers I caterers paid slightly lower
prices than that paid by consumers purchasing for
ceremonies. There was no significant difference between prices paid for animals purchased for rearing
and for sacrifice.
(b) In the overall model, WAD sheep and
Y' ankasa sheep prices were significantly higher and
Red Sokoto goat prices were significantly lower than
WAD goats. Prices of Y'ankasa sheep were significantly higher than those for WAD sheep. But the
pattern varied between purpose specific models. All
types of buyers paid significantly higher prices for
WAD sheep compared to WAD goats, except in the
case of butchers/caterers. There was no significant
difference between WAD goat and Red Sokoto goat
prices for animals purchased for rearing, trading and
festival but Red Sokoto goat prices were significantly lower in case of purchases for ceremonies and
butchering/ catering. Y' ankasa sheep prices were
significantly higher than those for WAD sheep in the
overall model as well as in the model for festival, for
which most Y' ankasa sheep were purchased.
(c) In the overall model, prices for females were
lower than for males, but the differences were not
significant. However, the pattern varied between purpose specific models. Females purchased for rearing,
trading and sacrifice were paid higher prices but
significant only in the case of rearing which is
consistent with the breeding objectives of the buyers.
Females purchased for butchering/ catering, cere-

monies and festivals were paid lower prices. The
difference was significant only in the case of purchases for festival, because preferably a male is
slaughtered for Eid-el-Kabir.
(d) In the overall model, prices in Apomu market
were significantly lower than in Oja. However, in
purpose specific models, prices in Apomu were
higher in some cases and lower in others but in no
case the difference was significant.
(e) The month of purchase was aggregated into
several groups on the basis of test runs which showed
that prices were similar during certain periods. In the
overall model, compared to December 1989-January
1990 period (which was considered as the base),
February to May 1990 prices were significantly
lower, and August to November 1990 prices were
also significantly lower. June-July and December
1990-January 1991 prices were not significantly
different from the base period. In the purpose specific models, the signs, magnitudes and significance
of periodic price differences were highly variable
though the general pattern was the same as that for
the overall model except in the case of festival
purchases, which was time specific. In the case of
festival, April-May prices were significantly lower
than the previous December-January prices but
June-July prices were significantly higher. The reason is that the festival held in June-July period was
more important than that held in April-May. The
prices in next December-January were significantly
lower compared to previous December-January, the
base period.

4. Discussion and conclusion
In the southwest Nigerian rural markets supplies,
sales and prices of small ruminants peak before the
Muslim festival of Eid-el-Kabir and to some extent
during the Christmas-New Year period. Throughout
the year, animals are purchased for rearing, trading,
butchering/ catering, sacrifice and various ceremonies such as marriage, funeral, birthdays, and for
festivals. There are strong preferences among buyers
for specific species and breeds of small ruminants
for specific purposes as indicated by significant differences in the volume of purchases. Local WAD
goats and sheep are preferred for rearing because of

M.A. Jabbar /Agricultural Economics 18 (1997) 21-30

their adaptation to the local environment, for
butchering/catering because of the local consumers'
taste and preference for the meat of local animals,
and for sacrifice which has long cultural tradition
attached to local animals. Local species /breeds were
also preferred for slaughtering on the occasion of
various ceremonies when entertaining guests was the
primary objective, and for festivals. But the present
purchase pattern indicates that this preference pattern
is changing with increasingly more northern
species/breeds used for these purposes. Northern
animals constituted 34% of supplies in the present
survey compared to 28% reported for a similar survey conducted during 1983-85 in which the same
markets were included (Francis, 1990).
Average supplies per market day including peak
period was 35 in 1983-1985 compared to 74 in the
1989-1991 survey. The market share of southern
animals in total supply and sales have remained
stable between the two survey periods. However, the
number of northern animals in the southern markets
in the normal as well as peak market periods have
increased significantly over time.
One of the principal reason for increased penetration of northern animals into the southern rural markets is that transportation of animals from the north
has become faster, easier and cheaper due to better
and wider roads that allow larger lorries to carry
many more animals per trip. Within the southern part
of the country, connection of rural markets to urban
centers, such as lbadan with Apomu, has improved.
Consequently, northern animals can be sold at more
competitive prices at rural markets.
Adjusted prices of WAD goats are either significantly higher or similar to Red Sokoto goat prices
depending on the purpose for buying but adjusted
prices of WAD sheep are significantly higher than
either goat breed for almost all purposes, indicating a
strong buyer preference for this breed.
Adjusted prices of Y' ankasa sheep, purchased
primarily for the Muslim festival of Eid-el-Kabir, is
higher than WAD sheep prices. However, the overall
market share of WAD sheep is only 9% compared to
70% for WAD goats and 21% for Red Sokoto goats.
It is probable that under strong price competition
from northern goats, and increasing consumer acceptance of northern animals for purposes for which
previously local species/breeds were preferred, the

29

market share of WAD sheep may decline further. On
the other hand, lower market share and significantly
higher adjusted prices for WAD sheep paid by all
categories of buyers indicate that there is excess
demand for this breed and so both producers and
consumers should benefit from increased WAD sheep
production. Producers and sellers will benefit by
targeting specific buyer categories and times of the
year because of strong buyer preferences for specific
species /breeds of animals for specific purposes and
because of their willingness to pay different prices
consistent with their preferences. Increasing market
share of northern animals in rural markets is evidence that northern producers and traders are taking
advantage of these market niches.
