Abstract
The hypothesis of asymmetry in price transmission within the Australian meat market is tested using monthly
data for beef, lamb and pork prices at different market levels over the period 1971-1988. The results indicate that
asymmetrical price response is a strategy used by beef and lamb retailers and wholesalers to adjust to changing input
prices, but not by pork retailers and wholesalers. This difference is perhaps unexpected given the similarity in
behaviours relating to price levelling in this market, the high cross-price elasticities of demand between these meats,
and the relatively greater degree of concentration in the pork market.

1. Introduction

Previous research has confirmed the presence
of short-term price levelling behaviour in the
Australian meat market (Naughtin and Quilkey,
1979; Griffith, Green and Duff, 1991). Price levelling refers to the practice of wholesalers (retailers) holding their selling prices relatively stable in the face of rising or falling auction (wholesale) prices. In effect, the resultant impact of
fluctuations in raw material prices on the prices
charged to consumers is smoothed or made less
volatile under price levelling. The evidence of this

type of behaviour by meat wholesalers and retailers has caused increasing concern about the efficiency of the meat market. First, as has been
demonstrated by Parish (1967), price levelling
destabilises farm level prices while stabilising retail prices. Livestock producers in particular are
concerned that changes in prices at the farm level
are both greater than they should be and are not
fully passed onto the higher levels of the market,
and so do not influence consumer purchase decisions. Second, there is the suspicion that wholesalers and retailers are more inclined to pass on
price rises than price falls. This is known as
asymmetric price transmission.
The ability of the wholesale and retail sectors
to undertake these types of pricing strategies
depends predominantly on the competitive structure of these sectors. Fewer, larger firms may

complete and rapid pass-through of cost increases but slower and less complete transmission
of cost savings" (Kinnucan and Forker, 1987, p.
285). In the Australian meat producing, processing and distribution sectors there have been some
underlying changes with respect to structure in
recent years, especially in the intensive industries.
Beef and lamb are the two traditional red meats
produced in Australia, mainly from extensive pasture grazing systems, while pork is one of the
major meats produced from intensive, indoor
production systems. The increasing concentration
in the pig processing and marketing sectors has
been well documented (Bennett, 1982). Similar
consolidation, though not to the same extent, has
occurred in the beef and lamb processing and
marketing sectors. This variation in concentration
in the Australian extensive and intensive meat
industries may manifest differing patterns of
asymmetrical pricing behaviour. Another possible
cause of differences may be variations in the
proportion of output exported and in the magnitudes of domestic per capita consumption of each
meat.
An understanding of price formation and price
transmission, including asymmetric pricing behaviour, is important in explaining the dynamics
of price transmission processes and pricing inefficiencies in the marketing of commodities. It is
also important in contributing to policy discussions relating to such issues as the rationalisation
of processing capacity, the regulation of throughput in the processing sector, and the distribution
of the benefits of research among producers,
processors and consumers. The value of this information is not constrained to developed agricultural economies such as Australia, but also
extends to developing countries where pressure is
apparent for better resource allocation and more
efficient marketing channels.
Most applications to date in this area have
been undertaken in the United States, mainly in
the pork market, and this is where the methodology has been developed. Heien (1980) and
Schroeder (1988) found evidence of asymmetry in
wholesale-retail pork price relationships. Furthermore, Hahn (1990) found that the farm, wholesale and retail prices of pork showed significant

evidence of asymmetric price interactions, with
retail prices displaying greater sensitivity to price
increasing shocks than to price declining shocks.
Alternatively, Boyd and Brorsen (1988, p. 103)
found " ... that wholesale (packer) prices respond
similarly to farm price decreases and increases.
Also there is no significant difference between
retailers' response to wholesale price increases
and their response to wholesale price decreases."
Some studies have examined the United States
beef market. Hall, Tomek, Ruther and Kyerine
(1981) found no evidence of asymmetry in farmwholesale or wholesale-retail beef price relationships. They concluded (p. 21) that "Wholesalers
and retailers do not appear to have treated increases in farm or carcass prices in a manner
different than decreases." However, Hahn (1990)
found that the farm, wholesale and retail prices
of beef showed significant evidence of asymmetric price interactions. Prices displayed greater
sensitivity to price increasing shocks than to price
declining shocks.
This issue of asymmetric price transmission
has not been examined for the processing and
marketing sectors of the Australia meat market
except for a brief exploration by Freebairn (1984)
and some recent work by Lye and Sibley (1991).
In a markup model explaining retail food prices
by farm prices, wages and the price of a substitute product, Freebairn added a dummy variable
to indicate periods when farm prices were rising.
He found a non-significant coefficient on this
variable for all foods studied including beef, lamb
and pork. Thus the hypothesis of asymmetrical
responses to price rises and price falls was not
supported. Lye and Sibly (1991), using customer
market analysis (emphasising consumer expectations about prices) and this data set, found that
retail meat prices in New South Wales were
inflexible, and more so in the downward direction
than the upward direction. Asymmetrical adjustment of prices was concluded.
The aim in this paper is to test the hypothesis
of short-term retail and wholesale price asymmetry in the Australian beef, lamb and pork markets
using a different methodology to those employed
previously by Freebairn (1984) and Lye and Sibley (1991).

2. Methodology

Background issues. The markup pncmg model
popularised by Heien (1980) forms the basis for
most subsequent research in this area. This model
is:

(1)
where PR is retail price of the commodity under
analysis, PF is farm price of the commodity on a
retail equivalent basis, C represents processing
and marketing costs; and the data are typically
measured at monthly intervals.
The use of this pricing rule rests on several
critical assumptions. First, the market for the
commodity is assumed to be competitive. It is
clear that concentration levels in meat processing
and distribution in Australia have increased in
recent years. For example in New South Wales
the four largest pig slaughtering organisations
accounted for 54% of total export licensed
slaughter in 1978 and 60% in 1984. The 20 or so
Australian pigmeat processing firms in the largest
employment size group constitute only 15% of
firms yet account for over 65% of turnover, value
added and employment (Griffith and Gill, 1987).
Some 40% of meat is sold through supermarkets
and two large chains dominate this market
(Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation,
1993). However, there are still large numbers of
processors, wholesalers and retailers in the Australian red meat industry, and the overall levels of
concentration, although rising, remain relatively
low (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 1990). Thus
this assumption seems plausible.
Second, the processing function is assumed to
be a Leontief-type fixed proportions transformation, with no possibility of other marketing inputs
being substituted for the farm commodity when
relative prices change. This is recognised as a
strong assumption but there is a lack of empirical
evidence on this. However, given that the data
are monthly, one would anticipate only limited
substitutability if any over this time period, hence
the assumption may be of little consequence in
practice. It would be difficult to make such an
assumption with annual data however.

309

Third, constant returns to scale are assumed.
This is equivalent to assuming constant marginal
costs of processing, or that variations in the volume of the farm commodity undergoing processing have no influence in explaining price transmission behaviour. This is perhaps the most contentious of the assumptions in the context of the
Australian meat industry, as previous work using
these or similar data has generally shown a significant negative relationship between the farm-retail margin and the quantity of livestock being
processed (Griffith, 1974; Griffith, Green and
Duff, 1991). Thus increasing returns to scale are
indicated, and a throughput variable should be
added to the basic markup model.
Fourth, there is an underlying assumption that
the retail price changes in response to a change
in price at the farm or wholesale level. Thus farm
price "causes" retail price in the Granger sense
(Granger, 1969). Although causality tests are not
conducted here, Freebairn (1984) has shown that
for beef and pork in the Sydney market the farm
price does indeed "cause" the retail price. Further, using a cross-spectral analysis Griffith (1975)
concluded tentatively that pork auction prices did
lead retail prices, so although there may be problems interpreting Granger causality tests, the
cross-spectral results provide some corroborating
evidence. Hence this assumption seems reasonable for beef and pork. However, for lamb, Freebairn found that retail price "causes" farm price 1•
This may be of some concern in interpreting the
results for lamb.
Two other methodological issues also require
consideration, First, when data periodicity is
monthly as in this study, the question of lags in

1 Freebairn rejected the null hypothesis that future values of
beef (pork) retail prices as a group had no influence on
current beef (pork) farm prices. Conversely, he could not
reject the null hypothesis that future values of farm prices as a
group had no influence on current retail prices. Thus current
values of farm prices were associated with future values of
retail prices, but not vice versa. For beef and pork, farm
prices "cause" retail prices. However, for lamb, current values
of retail prices were associated with future values of farm
prices, but not vice versa. For lamb, retail price "causes" farm
price.

responses become important. There are a number of reasons why changes in retail price typically tend to lag changes in farm price (Heien,
1980; Hall, Tomek, Ruther and Kyerine, 1981;
Ward, 1982) such as the time required to actually
perform the processing, storage, transport and
distribution functions; differences in price collection and reporting methods; the cost of retailers
changing prices; and differences in information
availability, transmission and use at different levels of the market. Therefore, in setting up a
model to test the asymmetry pricing hypothesis,
some form of lag structure should be incorporated on the independent variables. Also, as is
well known, problems of autocorrelation are
highly likely with monthly data.
Second, there is the issue of whether the dependent and independent variables should be
transformed in some way to more accurately mea-

sure the differential impacts of rising and falling
price phases. The conventional method (Ward,
1982; Kinnucan and Forker, 1987; Schroeder,
1988) is that two farm price variables, PFR (rising)
and PFF (falling) - or two wholesale price variables - should be constructed following Houck
(1977, p. 571) as shown in Table 1. The dependent variable and any other independent variables
should be expressed as deviations from their respective initial values. This technique is based on
earlier work by Wolffram (1971) and Houck (1977)
dealing with asymmetrical supply response and by
Heien (1980) who extended the method to price
transmission. Houck (1977) provides a detailed
justification for using these types of transformations. The key point is that the method decomposes or partitions changes in the dependent
variable, from a previous position in time (the
initial values) into changes due to rising input
prices, falling input prices, and other factors. In
applying the model, Heien (1980) calculated the
rising and falling farm price variables but did not
use any lag structure. Subsequent studies have
calculated the PFR and PFF variables and imposed
distributed lags (e.g. Ward, 1982).
Estimating model and hypothesis. The model used
for estimation in this study, based on Kinnucan
and Forker (1987) and the discussion above, is as
follows:

where for each meat, PFR and PFF are constructed
variables denoting the rising and falling phases of
PF as shown in Table 1, Q is the production of
meat, T is a trend term, and E is a random error;
the other variables are as previously defined; and
a, ... , f are coefficients to be estimated.
The first summation variable is always positive,
while the second is always negative. Almon distributed lag procedures are imposed on the calculated rising and falling variables, PFR and PFF, so i
and j are the lengths of the Almon lags on PFR
and PFF, respectively. The retail price, cost and
quantity variables are expressed as deviations
from their respective initial values. Neither the

G.R. Griffith, N.E. Piggott j Agricultural Economics 10 (1994) 307-316

cost nor quantity variables are specified in distributed lag forms. Cost changes gradually over
time and as Heien (1980) has noted, retailers
tend to use the smoothed value of cost as a basis
for pricing (see also Griffith, Green and Duff,
1991). Presumably, these retailers would also even
out the price impacts of throughput fluctuations.
The ci coefficients represent the net effect of
rising farm prices on retail prices while the dj
coefficients represent the net effect of falling
farm prices on retail prices. The appropriate test
of whether there is a significant difference in the
sum of the coefficients of the rising phase of farm
prices versus the falling phase in farm prices can
be formally represented as:
Ha: L:ici = L:jdj

(3)

H 1 : H 0 not true

( 4)

A t-test was used to test this null hypothesis.
Equivalent models to that specified in Eq. (2) are
also specified for the farm-wholesale and the
wholesale-retail components of the price transmission process. So in all there are nine equations to be estimated. In addition, in all models, a
dummy variable DD is added to reflect a change
in price calculation procedures in 1980, and
monthly dummy variables n1, ... , n11 are added
to measure any seasonal patterns not already
accounted for.
Alternative modelling frameworks to Eq. (2)
that have been used in the asymmetry and price
transmission literature are the Vector Autoregressive (VAR) Models of Babula, Bessler and
Schulter (1990) and the Generalised Switching
Model (GSM) of Hahn (1990). VAR is a "dataoriented technique [which] provides evidence on
the dynamic properties of relationships" (Babula
et al., 1990, p. 13). However, no explanation of
the reasons for this behaviour is provided. More
structural, economic models, such as those reported here, are required for this purpose. Hahn
(1990, p. 21) considers his GSM to be "the rough
equivalent of a set of unrestricted reduced form
equations for a general set of endogenous switching regressions relating the farm, wholesale, and
retail prices of a meat." The models reported
here are structural models rather than reduced

311

form models, and are therefore more suited to
explanation of the factors causing price transmission differences across meats. Neither of these
alternative models are applied in this study, but a
comparison of results and policy implications from
each would be of interest.

3. Data

Monthly data for the period January 1971 to
December 1988 were used (n = 216) for the following variables:
PFk
Monthly estimated dressed auction carcase price, in centsjkg, of composite beef,
lamb and pork carcases sold at Homebush
sale-yards in Sydney and adjusted for
byproducts and shrinkage.
Pwk
Monthly wholesale price, in centsjkg, of
composite beef, lamb and pork carcases
sold in the Homebush meat halls in Sydney and adjusted for shrinkage.
PRk
Monthly composite retail price, in cents/
kg, of beef, lamb and pork at selected
retail outlets in Sydney.
cwk
Indices of monthly wholesale marketing
costs for beef, lamb and pork. Slaughtering fees comprise over 50% of wholesale
operating costs, so slaughtering fees
charged at Homebush abattoir in Sydney
were used as a proxy for all wholesale
costs. The base period was January 1971
= 100.00.
cR
An index of monthly retail marketing costs.
Since wages contribute over 50% of retail
operating expenses, the weekly wage rate
for a New South Wales General Butcher
Shopman under the Federal Meat Industry Award was used as a proxy for all
retailing costs. The base was January 1971
= 100.00.
Qk
Throughput of each meat. Due to the
closure of the Homebush abattoir in mid
1988, it was not possible to obtain
throughput at the Homebush meat halls.
As a proxy New South Wales production
of beef, lamb and pigmeat was used.

beef, lamb and pork.

All the basic auction, wholesale and retail price
data came from the records of the now Economic
Services Unit of N.S.W. Agriculture. The procedures for adjusting and weighting these prices
and for calculating the wholesale and retail
spreads are outlined in detail by Griffith, Strong,
Green and Freshwater (1992). Slaughtering fees
came from the records of the Homebush Abattoir
Corporation and the N.S.W. Meat Industry Authority, throughput came from the Australian
Meat and Livestock Corporation, and wage rates
came from the Meat and Allied Trades Federation and the N.S.W. Department of Industrial
Relations. The price and cost variables were all
expressed in nominal terms.
As noted above, PFR and PFF were calculated
from PF, and the equivalent rising and falling
wholesale price variables PWR and PWF were calculated from PW, for use in the estimating equations. For beef, approximately 51% of the observations on PF and 50% of observations on PW
were falling, while for lamb the relevant percentages were very similar, 49% and 51%. For pork,
approximately 44% of the observations on PF and
41% of observations on PW were falling, so a
reliable estimate of the presence or absence of
asymmetrical price response should be able to be
provided.

4. Estimation technique

The nine equations were estimated using least
squares procedures. Limited experimentation in. dicated that autocorrelation was endemic and all
subsequent equations were estimated with a
first-order correction.

The question of jointly choosing lag length and
order of polynomial for the Almon lags was resolved as follows. First, the lengths of the lags
were determined by adding lagged variables until
insignificant coefficients were encountered using
a t-test. Where significant lag lengths greater
than two were found, higher order polynomials
were tested for using an F-test.

5. Results

Estimated equations. The results of estimating the
nine equations of the form specified in Eq. (2)
above, using the data transformations and methods described there, are reported in Tables 2, 3
and 4 for beef, lamb and pork, respectively.
There were some common features of all of
these equations: the extremely high level of explained variance; the large size and high significance of the rho coefficient, which indicated that
there was very strong positive autocorrelation in
the raw residuals; the overall lack of significance
of seasonality, significant only in the pork farmwholesale and in the lamb farm-wholesale price
linkages; and the short lag lengths which were
significant in the Almon lags, only reaching a lag
of three months in the lamb wholesale-retail linkage (Table 3).
Features which differed across equations included the influence of cost factors, which were
significant in five of the nine equations, but contrary to expectations - were mostly negative;
the influence of time trends, which were mostly
significant for lamb and pork but not for beef; the
influence of the dummy variable for the change
in calculation procedure, which was significant
for beef but not generally for lamb or pork; and
the influence of throughput, which had a significant effect on the explanation of price transmission for lamb but not generally for beef or pork.
Only the lag lengths for lamb were greater
than two (Table 3). An F-test of the null hypothesis of a linear model could not be rejected. All
Almon polynomials were therefore linear.

Asymmetry hypothesis. A test of the asymmetry
hypothesis was formulated following Mendenhall,
Schaeffer and Wackerly (1981):

where the variance of the difference between the

between each of the components of both sums.
This procedure was followed for each of the
equations estimated in this study and the results

are reported near the bottom of Tables 2, 3
and 4.
The results show that for six of the nine price
linkages (all three beef; wholesale-retail and
farm-retail Iamb; and farm-wholesale pork), the
cumulative effect on the dependent variable of
rising input prices (I:;c) exceeded the cumulative
effect of falling input prices (L:jd). In three of
these six cases (beef wholesale-retail and farm-retail, and lamb wholesale-retail) the test statistics
were significantly different from zero, rejecting
the null hypothesis. Thus there was asymmetry in

wholesale or retail price transmission between
periods of rising and falling farm or wholesale
prices, in these three cases, over this data period.
Price rises were passed on more fully than price
falls in these cases. In the other three cases
where the cumulative rise exceeded the cumulative fall (beef and pork farm-wholesale and Iamb
farm-retail), the test statistics were not significantly different from zero, failing to reject the
null hypothesis. Thus there was no asymmetry in
price transmission in these instances.
In the remaining three price linkages (lamb
farm-wholesale, and pork farm-retail and wholesale-retail), the cumulative effect on retail price

of falling farm or wholesale prices ('[,jd) exceeded the cumulative effect of rising farm or
wholesale prices ('[,icJ For the two pork linkages
(Table 4), the test statistics were not significantly
different from zero, failing to reject the null
hypothesis. Thus the results indicate no asymmetry in wholesale or retail price transmission between periods of rising and falling pork farm or
wholesale prices, over this data period. However,
in the lamb farm-wholesale linkage (Table 3), the
test statistic was significantly different from zero,
rejecting the null hypothesis. Thus some asymmetry in lamb wholesale price transmission between
periods of rising and falling farm prices seems
evident over this data period. Price falls were
passed on more fully than price rises in this case.
Further, there was some evidence that the
response to price changes at lower levels of the
market was slower for beef and lamb price rises
than for price falls because in most of the equations there was a longer lagged response on the
rising prices than there was on the falling prices.
For pork, however, this did not seem to be apparent because in one of the equations there was a
lagged response on the falling prices while in the
other equations there was a lagged response on
the rising prices.
The means of the price rises and price falls for
each price level were also examined, using a
t-test for the difference between two sample
means. The results are reported in Table 5. For
each of the nine prices, the mean increases were
greater than the mean decreases, but only for
beef and pork retail prices were these differences
significant (at the 5% and 10% levels, respectively). This suggested that for these two cases,
retail prices adjusted less fully to falling wholesale prices than to rising wholesale prices. This
confirmed the evidence reported in Table 2 for
beef, where the coefficient on the price fall variable was less than the coefficient on the price rise
variable in the two relevant equations. However,
the results contradicted the evidence for pork,
where the coefficient on the price rise variable
was less than the coefficient on the price fall
variable in the two relevant equations.
Finally, there were more price rises than price
falls at the retail level, and the actual numbers of

rises and falls were very similar reflecting the
high cross-price elasticities of demand between
these meats (Piggott and Griffith, 1992). The
picture was somewhat different at the farm and
wholesale levels where there were similar numbers of price rises and price falls, except for pork
at the farm level where the number of rises
exceeded the number of falls by a substantial
margin. At the wholesale level there were a relatively greater number of "no changes", especially
for pork. This fact reinforced findings of shortterm price levelling at the wholesale level found
in other work (Griffith, Green and Duff, 1991).
For pork, the substantial number of "no changes"
may explain why neither of the components of
the overall pork farm-retail price linkage showed
any significant asymmetry behaviour. The wholesale market was disrupting the process of transmitting changes in market conditions between the
different levels of the market.

6. Summary and Conclusions

In this paper the hypothesis of asymmetrical
pricing behaviour in the Australian beef, lamb
and pork market has been examined. There were
five main results. First, the cumulative effect on
retail or wholesale price of the rising wholesale or

315

farm beef and lamb price variable exceeded the
cumulative effect of the falling wholesale or farm
price variable in five of the six relevant equations.
Three of these equations rejected the null hypothesis suggesting that there was some asymmetry in price transmission between periods of rising
and falling wholesale or farm beef and lamb
prices. In the sixth equation, the cumulative effect on wholesale lamb price of the falling farm
lamb price variable exceeded the cumulative effect of the rising farm price variable, with the test
statistic being significant. Again this suggests
asymmetry.
Second, the cumulative effect on retail or
wholesale price of the rising wholesale or farm
pork price variable did not exceed the cumulative
effect of the falling wholesale or farm price variable in two of the three relevant equations. In the
third equation, the cumulative effect on wholesale pork price of the rising farm pork price
variable exceeded the cumulative effect of the
falling farm price variable. However, in each case,
the test statistics were very small, indicating failure to reject the null hypothesis. The results
suggest that there was no asymmetry in price
transmission between periods of rising and falling
wholesale or farm pork prices.
Third, for each of the three prices of each
meat, the mean increases were greater than the
mean decreases, although only for beef and pork
retail prices were these differences significant.
This suggests that the beef and pork retail prices
adjust less fully to falling wholesale prices than to
rising wholesale prices.
Fourth, for pork there were a much greater
number of price rises than price falls at the farm
and retail levels. The picture was somewhat different at the wholesale level where there were
similar numbers of price rises and price falls and
a substantial number of "no changes". This fact
reinforces findings of price levelling at the wholesale level found in other work (Griffith, 1974;
Naughtin and Quilkey, 1979; Griffith, Green and
Duff, 1991).
Finally, for beef and lamb there were a much
greater number of price rises than price falls at
the retail level. At the farm and wholesale levels
there were similar numbers of price rises and

316

price falls and at the wholesale level there were a
greater number of "no changes". Again findings
of price levelling at the wholesale level found in
other work are validated.
Therefore this study provides new evidence
which confirms Freebairn's (1984) conclusion relating to the absence of price asymmetry for pork,
but not for beef and lamb. Conversely, for beef
and lamb the results of this study accord with
those of Lye and Sibly (1991) who found evidence
of asymmetrical adjustment of retail prices in the
New South Wales meat market.
On balance it appears that in the Australian
meat market, asymmetrical price response is an
adjustment strategy used by beef and lamb retailers and wholesalers to contend with input price
changes, but it is not employed by pork retailers
and wholesalers. This difference in behaviour is
perhaps unexpected given the similarity in behaviours relating to price levelling and the high
cross-price elasticities. Also, given the relatively
greater degree of concentration in the pig market, if any meat was to show evidence of asymmetry it would be expected to have been pork.
