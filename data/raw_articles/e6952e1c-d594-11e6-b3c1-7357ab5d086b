Abstract
Risk and uncertainty have been extensively studied by agricultural economists. In this paper we question (a) the predominant
use of static frameworks to formally analyse risk; (b) the predominant focus on risk aversion as the motivation for considering
risk and (c) the notion that explicitly probabilistic models are likely to be helpful to farmers in their decision making. We pose
the question: for a risk-averse farmer, what is the extra value of a recommendation derived from a model that represents risk
aversion, compared to a model based on risk neutrality? The conclusion reached is that for the types of the decision problems
most commonly modelled by agricultural economists, the extra value of representing risk aversion is commonly very little.

1. Introduction
Farmers face uncertainty about the economic consequences of their actions due to their limited ability
to predict things such as weather, prices and biological responses to different farming practices. In recognising this feature of farming, studies addressing risk
and uncertainty 1 are common in the agricultural economics literature. Risk is widely seen as an issue of
critical importance to farmers' decision making and to
policies affecting those decisions (e.g. Anderson et al.,
1977; Boussard, 1979; Anderson, 1982; Robison and
Barry, 1987).

1 In this paper we use the terms 'risk' and 'uncertainty' interchangeably to mean 'uncertainty in consequences' (Antle, 1983;
Hardaker eta!., 1991).

Like most major areas of academic endeavour, the
study of risk in farming has generated a body of conventional wisdom which occasionally is challenged
(e.g. Antle, 1983; Leathers and Quiggin, 1991). Our
aim in this paper is to criticise some areas of this conventional wisdom concerning the practical incorporation of risk in farm management models. This paper is
not another critique of subjective expected utility theory and its various alternatives (e.g. Machina, 1981,
1982; Buschena and Zilberman, 1994). Rather, the focus is on the use of risk models to analyse farm-related
problems. Some aspects of the approaches used most
commonly in modelling risk are examined and the
uses and usefulness of these approaches in agriculture
is discussed. A premise of the ensuing discussion is
that the appropriate level of detail and sophistication
in the modelling of agricultural risks depends on the
intended uses of the model. Three such uses are discussed and differences in the appropriate modelling
approach are highlighted.

2. Objectives of farm modelling
The design of a farm model is itself a decision problem involving risk, objectives, and constraints. The
choice depends on: (a) the proximity of task deadlines;
(b) the availability, quality and cost of data and skilled
modellers; (c) the marginal costs and benefits of extra
effort to enlarge or complicate the model and (d) uncertainties such as the extent to which the problem or
farming system may change during the construction of
the model. Further, the choice of modelling technique
depends on the objectives of the modeller, which may
include: (a) to publish in a refereed journal; (b) to support the government's decision making by predicting
either farmer behaviour or changes in welfare in response to a change in, for example, government policy,
technology, prices or climate and (c) to help farmers
make decisions. In the following sections these objectives are considered in more detail and their relevance
to the modelling of agricultural risks is discussed.

3. Publishing
Suppose that the modeller' s objective is to publish
in an economics journal an analysis of a farm management problem. For many, the solution to the decision problem outlined above is to develop a formal
algebraic model of the problem, preferably addressing a topical or emerging issue, with uncertainty represented explicitly. Commonly, the model represents
risk aversion as part of the farmer's objective, analytical solutions are derived and formal conclusions distilled from the results.
The requirement for analytical solutions often
causes the problem to be simplified substantially,
resulting in potentially severe specification errors
(Musser et al., 1986; Kingwell, 1996). The modelling
framework can be subjective expected utility, for despite its acknowledged limitations (Machina, 1981,
1982; Quiggin, 1982; Schoemaker, 1982; Just et al.,
1990), it remains widely used and acceptable to most
reviewers and journal editors (Hardaker et al., 1991;
Bar-Shira, 1992).
The emphasis on algebraic models is unfortunate
because in practice, assessing the impacts of, and optimal responses to, risk is primarily a numbers game
(Preckel and DeVuyst, 1992). It is rarely possible to

generalise about the desirability or otherwise of a particular farming strategy, since the numbers vary widely
from one situation to another. For example, yield distributions differ across soil types, regions and crop
types (Stanford et al., 1994) and price distributions
differ by commodity and data period (Lapp and Smith,
1992). Babcock and Hennessy (1996) note that prices
and yields are often assumed to be normally distributed
(e.g. Fraser, 1994; Lapan and Moschini, 1994) which
simplifies the analysis but is inconsistent with empirical evidence about the skewness of yields (Stanford et al., 1994) and with the non-negativity of yields
and prices. Furthermore, the relative importance of
price risk and production risk can vary widely between different enterprises, different farming systems
and through time (Harris et al., 1974).
Factors such as climate, crop diseases, soil types,
crop species, irrigation, marketing policies and technology interact to form and alter the uncertainties of
alternative farming practices. Ignoring these multiple sources of uncertainty is essential in an algebraic
analysis to ensure tractability, 2 yet it is a specification error which can lead to false conclusions. For
example, Pannell (1991) argued that the reputation
of pesticides as 'risk-reducing' inputs was based primarily on studies which considered only uncertainty
about pest density and/or pesticide effectiveness (e.g.
Feder, 1979; Carlson, 1984). If the uncertainties of
other factors such as price and potential yield were
considered, pesticides could be either risk-reducing
or risk-increasing. This argument has been supported
in subsequent analyses (Leathers and Quiggin, 1991;
Horowitz and Lichtenberg, 1994a, b).

4. Supporting government decision making
If it is accepted that a numerical rather than an analytical approach to modelling is necessary to support
government decision making, it still remains necessary to choose the level of detail to be modelled and
the modelling technique (Anderson et al., 1977; Hazell
and Norton, 1986; Kennedy, 1986). These issues inevitably require judgement over the benefits and costs
2 Robison and Barry (1987) note: "two random variables ...
quickly complicate our analysis, forcing us into numeric rather
than analytic approaches" (p. 110).

of including aspects of the decision problem in the
model (Anderson, 1982). The key judgements related
to risk are:
• Should the model's time frame be static or dynamic?
• If dynamic, should the model allow for tactical decision making, based on updated information in each
time period?
• Should risk aversion be represented?
4.1. Relative importance of representing tactical
adjustments and risk aversion
Most studies of risk in economics and agricultural
economics have adopted the static framework and included risk aversion in the decision maker's objective
function (e.g. Sandmo, 1971; Feder, 1979). In these
studies, risk or uncertainty matters, because decision
makers endeavour to move away from strategies with
relatively high variance of income towards strategies
with relatively low variance, if necessary at the cost
of some reduction in expected income.
Most farmers would be puzzled that as a discipline
we focus so much on this aspect of risk management.
For them, the main issue raised by variability of price
and production is how to respond tactically and dynamically to unfolding opportunities or threats to generate additional income or to avoid losses (i.e. how to
respond to 'embedded risk'). For example, Ortmann
et al. (1992) found that the information farmers desire
for risk management is largely concerned with defining the expected outcome, not with avoiding risk per
se. Such information allows farmers to respond profitably to variations in prices or climate and so is attractive even to 'risk-neutral' farmers, meaning those,

whose objective is to maximise expected profit. Perhaps in recognition of this, there is a growing literature that stresses the need to consider the dynamic and
tactical features of farming (Rae, 1971; Antle, 1983;
Schroeder and Featherstone, 1990; Taylor, 1993).
Several discrete stochastic programming studies
have represented both tactical farm management
responses and risk aversion (Schroeder and Featherstone, 1990; Featherstone et al., 1993; Kingwell,
1994; Pannell and Nordblom, 1998), allowing the
possibility of examining the relative importance of
including tactics and risk aversion in the models. For
example, Kingwell et al. (1993) found that the expected farm profit in a region of Western Australia
could be increased by over 20% through appropriate
tactical adjustments of farm plans, while Kingwell
(1994) showed that when risk aversion was included
in analyses of this farming system, optimal expected
profit fell by only 2-6%. The results in Table 1 are
from optimal solutions of the same model 3 with or
without representation of risk aversion and with or
without representation of tactical options. The utility maximising solutions employ a Pratt-Arrow risk
aversion coefficient of 3.0x 10-6 which would be
considered extremely high for this region based on
published empirical evidence (e.g. Bond and Wonder,
1980; Bardsley and HmTis, 1987). The increase in
expected profit from tactical adjustments is 10-12%,
whereas the reduction in expected profit given risk
aversion is less than 3%.

3 The model is a discrete stochastic programming model of a
representative farm. Risk aversion is represented using a method
similar to DEMP (Lambert and McCarl, 1985) and UEP (Patten
et a!., 1988).

In examining the relative importance of representing tactics or risk aversion, the most relevant comparison is of certainty equivalent 4 values for the solutions
(Table 2). In calculating these certainty equivalents, it
is assumed that the farmer is risk-averse (absolute risk
aversion=3.0x w- 6 ). The impact of risk aversion is
even less than suggested by results in Table 1, with
certainty equivalents changing by less than 1%. Compared to the ideal model that includes risk aversion
and tactical options, a model which failed to represent tactics would have identified a solution around
$12,000 per year less valuable to the farmer. By contrast, the loss of certainty equivalent from accepting a
recommended strategy that fails to consider risk aversion would have been only $1000 or less.
While it is acknowledged that presentation of illustrative results does not provide a general proof, it is
stressed that:
1. This model represents a farming system with high
levels of price and production risk.
2. The results exaggerate the importance of risk aversion by using a risk aversion coefficient which is
unrealistically high for most farmers in the region.
3. The results are easily explicable (see below) and
are consistent with all other numerical examples of
which we are aware.
4. The results are consistent with the attitudes of farmers, as mentioned earlier.

4 The 'certainty equivalent' is the dollar value to a risk-averse
person of the risky outcome of an investment. It is less than the
expected value of profit or income from the investment due to the
deduction of a 'risk premium' which increases with the level of
risk and with the person's degree of risk aversion.

Overall, our reading of the available evidence is
that the trends evident in Table 2 are, if not general,
at least extremely common. The primary reason for
the low impact of risk aversion lies in the unresponsiveness of certainty equivalent to changes in farm
management within the region of the optimum. This
is directly comparable to a classic result in analysis
of response to inputs, such as fertilisers. Variations
in management practices within the region of the
optimum make little difference to the level of net
benefits because the profit function is fiat near the
optimum (Anderson, 1975). Because of this flatness,
consideration of complexities such as risk aversion,
which only change the optimal strategy by moderate
amounts, does not greatly affect farmer welfare. Thus,
the argument is not that risk aversion does not affect
the farmer's optimal plan, but that the impact of the
changes on farmer welfare is small. This is likely to
be true for any choice involving a continuous or approximately continuous decision variable (e.g. areas
planted, input levels, stocking rates, feeding strategies
and investment in futures contracts). It may be less
true for large discrete choices such as decisions on
purchase of land or large machinery.
Representation of tactical adjustments makes a
greater difference to the certainty equivalent because
the main benefits of tactical adjustments occur in the
extreme years, both good and bad. In these years
the optimal management practices are very different
to the optimal practices for most years, mainly due
to impacts on expected profit, rather than risk. The
differences in strategy in extreme years are generally
larger than those prompted by risk aversion alone, often to the extent that certainty equivalent is sensitive
to the change.

Nordblom (1998).

To illustrate further the low impact of representing risk aversion on the value of a model's recommended strategy, Fig. 1 shows the consequences of
mis-specifying a producer's risk aversion coefficient
in a representative farm model in north-west Syria
(Pannell and Nordblom, 1998).
Each line in Fig. 1 represents the certainty equivalent value of income for a hypothetical Syrian farmer
with a utility function characterised by constant relative risk aversion. The different lines represent farmers
with different levels of relative risk aversion (RRA).
Moving from left to right along a line corresponds
to different combinations of enterprises and practices
identified as optimal by models of increasing risk aversion. On each line, at only one point does the risk aversion coefficient of the model correspond to that of the
farmer and, at this point, the certainty equivalent value
to that farmer of the plan recommended by the model
is maximised. All other models recommend a plan of
lower value. The most striking aspect of the figure is
the flatness of the lines, reflecting that the certainty
equivalent value of a farm model's recommended plan
is insensitive to the degree of risk aversion used to derive the plan. If a risk-averse farmer implemented a
plan which would be optimal for a risk-neutral farmer,
the level of potential utility foregone by the farmer
would be small. This is made clearer in Table 3, which
shows the loss of potential certainty equivalent for various farmers from implementing the recommendations

of a risk-neutral model. Not surprisingly, the cost increases with the degree of risk aversion of the farmer.
However, even at the highest level of risk aversion
(RRA=3.2), the cost in certainty equivalence of ignoring risk aversion is less than 2%. Although, risk
aversion coefficients of Syrian farmers have not been
estimated, on the basis of other studies in developing countries (e.g. Binswanger, 1980; Antle, 1987) we
would expect that for most Syrian farmers the cost of
ignoring risk aversion when selecting a plan would be
less than 1%. The small value of this cost is even more
surprising given that climatic risks faced by Syrian
farmers are among the highest in the world (Nguyen,
1989).
Notice that although certainty equivalent is insensitive to farm strategy, it is sensitive to the risk aversion coefficient, as reflected in the distances between
the lines in Fig. 1. It is not claimed that risk-averse
farmers are little affected by risk. If that were true, the
lines in Fig. 1 would lie close together. The argument
here rests on the lines' flatness, not their separation.
The flatness reflects the empirical result that the feasible and optimal extent of risk avoidance is relatively
small.
A third example from a contrasting situation is presented in Table 4 which shows findings for a weed control problem in a region of Western Australia (Pannell,
1995). The model selects optimal herbicide dosages
for a representative farm. Even when the importance
of risk aversion is exaggerated by assuming perfect
correlation between yields on each hectare and by assuming a relative risk aversion coefficient of 3.2, the
cost of using a risk-neutral model is less than 1%. For
more realistic assumptions it is less than 0.1 %.

Some farm modelling studies that consider tactics
and risk aversion identify risk aversion as an important influence on farm management (Schroeder and
Featherstone, 1990; Featherstone et al., 1993). However, these studies do not ask the question that we
have addressed above: to what extent does adjusting
farm management in response to risk aversion increase
farmer welfare. They also do not address the issue of
the relative importance of including tactics versus risk
aversion. For example, Featherstone et al. (1993) described a representative Indiana farm and examined
optimal capital structures using a discrete stochastic
programming formulation. Some of their results are
reproduced in Table 5.

When the farm has an initial debt to asset ratio of
40% risk aversion has little impact on the certainty
equivalent of the annual return to initial equity. At
an initial debt to asset ratio of 70% risk aversion has
a greater effect in reducing the certainty equivalent.
However, recall from the earlier results, that it would
be a fallacy to think that certainty equivalent being
sensitive to risk aversion necessarily implies that a
model with risk aversion generates substantially more
valuable recommendations than a risk-neutral model.
Failure to recognise this fallacy is a cause of some
agricultural economists over-rating the importance of
modelling risk aversion. Nevertheless, it is true that
many studies have found that farm activity selections
were affected by the degree of risk aversion (Hazell
et al., 1983; Chavas and Holt, 1990; Schroeder and
Featherstone, 1990; Kingwell, 1994). There is no paradox here. The explanation lies in the flatness of the
certainty equivalent curves, as outlined earlier. Thus,
the importance of representing risk aversion depends
very much on the objectives of the study. Risk aversion will be relatively more important in studies with
an objective of predicting behavioural responses to a
change, rather than of assessing welfare impacts or
making recommendations to farmers.
Even for predictive purposes, however, there are reasons to believe that representation of risk aversion is
not as important as often portrayed in the literature. In
some studies, the impact of risk aversion on optimal
management is exaggerated by (a) using unrealisticly
high risk aversion coefficients; (b) failure to represent
farm constraints and technology realistically (Musser,
McCarl, and Smith) and/or (c) modelling individual
enterprises without considering their degree of correlation with other enterprises or decisions. In some
studies, with or without these failings, the impact of
risk aversion on behaviour has been found to be low
(e.g. Smidts, 1990). Finally, even when risk aversion
does truly affect management, its effects may still be
small in relation to those of other factors that may be
considered for inclusion in the model.
Often, better representation of the biology, production alternatives, technology, taxation ramifications,
resource endowments, weather-year and price conditions, and tactical oppmtunities will yield more
valuable information about change at the farm-level
than sophisticated inclusion of risk aversion. Overall,
we conclude that if a farm management model is to

D.J. Pannell et a!. I Agricultural Economics 23 (2000) 69-78

be constructed to predict or evaluate change at the
farm-level, then inclusion of risk aversion is often of
secondary importance. This is not to deny that farmers are risk-averse (Bond and Wonder, 1980; Antle,
1987; Bardsley and Harris, 1987; Myers, 1989), nor
to claim that risk aversion has no impact on welfare
or behaviour. Rather, the evidence is that if we wish
to evaluate a model by its ability to predict and evaluate change, then in many situations the net benefits of
using modelling resources to represent risk aversion
are less that the net benefits of using the resources to
improve other aspects of the model. This echoes the
sentiments of Sonka (1983):
Our concentration on risk [aversion] as a source of
non-profit-maximising behavior may have led us off
the main trail. Several factors including production
constraints, multiple goals and lack of information
could cause farmers to make non-profit-maximising
decisions. We should be concerned about assessing
the impacts of these factors, not just the presence
of risk. (p. 202).
One cost of excluding risk aversion from a farm
management model, would be that the model would
not give due weight to the risk-reducing benefits of
diversification. A traditional view is that diversification is a key risk management strategy (Samuelson,
1967). By generating income from several activities
whose returns are not perfectly correlated, a farmer
can reduce the overall income variance. Sometimes,
the failure to represent risk is cited as a reason why
outputs from some mathematical programming models of farms are not as diversified as the actual farms
they represent.
However, optimal farm plans for risk-neutral and
risk-averse farmers can be similarly diversified (Brink
and McCarl, 1978; Kingwell, 1994) since risk aversion is only one of a number of possible incentives
for diversification. Reasons for diversification by the
risk-neutral farmer include:
1. Non-uniformity of resource quality. For example,
on large farms with different areas and types of
soil the profitability of crop or pasture alternatives
differ according to soil type leading to a mix of
enterprises across the farm (Morrison et al., 1986;
Kingwell et al., 1992).
2. Resource constraints. In the short run, limits on
machinery capacity coupled with yield reductions
from later sowing affect the optimal size of crop-

75

ping programs and may result in a mixture of enterplises. Similarly, labour supply and demand at
particular times through the year may preclude a
high concentration of other resources in a particular enterprise.
3. Complementarities or positive interactions between enterprises. These include benefits of particular rotational sequences (e.g. nitrogen fixation
by legumes, disease control, weed control, soil
structure and soil organic matter content), and
contributions of crop residues to livestock diets
(Pannell, 1987). Hence, the failure of some mathematical programming models to select diversified
farm plans is at least as likely to be due to their
failure to adequately represent essential biological
or physical characteristics of the farming system
as their exclusion of risk aversion.
Deterministic whole-farm models, such as MIDAS 5 (Kingwell and Pannell, 1987), which do
represent these features can select strategies which
are highly diversified, with risk-reduction as an
unplanned-for bonus.
Consider, then, the possibility that choosing to build
a model without any representation of risk or uncertainty may be optimal when the marginal benefits and
costs of modelling effort are fully assessed. The resources saved by not explicitly representing risk can
be used to (a) represent other, more important, aspects
of the farming system; (b) improve the quality of data
in the model; (c) conduct more extensive model testing; (d) apply the model sooner and more often and
(e) construct additional versions of the model for different purposes. An additional advantage is that deterministic models are much easier to test and maintain
by virtue of their smaller size. Risk and uncertainty
may still be considered in any analysis by the use of
sensitivity analysis to investigate discrete scenarios of
interest (Pannell, 1997).
One situation which may weigh heavily against development of a deterministic model is where the intended audience for the modelling results perceive that
explicitly representing risk is of critical importance.
In this case, explicit representation of risk, risk aver5 'Deterministic' models have no explicit representation of probabilities related to risk or uncertainty. Parameters are specified as
fixed, best-bet or mean values. MIDAS stands for model of an
integrated dryland agricultural system.

76

sian and/or tactical responses to risk may increase the
credibility of the model sufficiently to warrant the effort involved, irrespective of their impact on the value
of the results.

5. Aiding farmer decision making
A final reason for constructing a farm model is to
aid farmer decision-making. Farmers make numerous
decisions against the backdrop of two key objectives.
The first is that most farmers wish to stay in farming despite the shocks of price and weather and the
changes in policy, technology and social conditions
that typify agriculture. The second is that farmers wish
to increase their wealth over time. The keys to achieving these objectives are to get right the big decisions,
such as those on land purchase, machinery investment and resource improvement (Malcolm, 1994) and
to make correct major tactical adjustments (K.ingwell
et al., 1993).
This conclusion is supported, for Australia at least,
by farm survey evidence (Ripley and Kingwell, 1984;
Edwards, 1994). The farmers most likely to be under
acute financial strain at any time are those who bought
land or machinery at the wrong time or at the wrong
price or who made significant and incorrect major adjustments to their farm operations. Hence, it is not the
everyday or even annual risk management decisions
that are likely to crucially affect farm viability. Surprisingly, the important long-run, major decisions are
largely ignored in the risk literature, which focuses
mainly on decisions about input levels and output
portfolios.
In developing models for use by farmers, the question of appropriate complexity and sophistication is
central. The reality of farming is complex. Dynamic,
stochastic, biological, technical, financial and human
factors interact in a way that will probably never be
incorporated fully in any mathematical model of agricultural decision analysis. Ironically, however, "the
elaborate decision analytical methods such as those
espoused in the decision theory and systems literature are not much use in practice in the very complex
and uncertain situation of the farm business, whilst
the straight-forward farm management budgets are
extremely useful" (Malcolm, 1994, p. 21 ). Patrick
and DeVuyst (1995) also emphasise the limitations

of sophisticated risk modelling techniques for most
farmers, pointing out that there is considerably more
risk-related research information available than is
being incorporated into extension programs.
The reality of farm management, which farmers understand well, is that, it is better to solve the whole
problem roughly than to attempt to solve part of the
problem extremely well. The advantage of simple budgeting approaches to farm planning is that, at least at
some level, it facilitates consideration of all relevant
characteristics of the unique farm business (e.g. enterprise interactions, constraints, personal preferences,
attitudes, competencies and experiences). Use of sensitivity analysis to examine discrete key scenarios and
identify break-even circumstances are simple but valuable methods of incorporating risk in this decision process, both from the point of view of risk aversion and
tactical adjustments. The techniques are unsophisticated and old, yet they provide the farmer with an opportunity to discern the nature and potential impact of
uncertainties in a way that promotes sensible management of risk. They can capture sufficient detail, sometimes implicitly, so that the value of the information
generated for the farmer is higher than could be generated by a less timely, more partial and more obscure
sophisticated risk model.

6. Concluding comments
We are not arguing that farmers are risk-neutral,
that farming is free of risk, nor that diversification is
ineffective as a risk-reducing strategy. Nor is the paper about the validity of decision theory, subjective
expected utility theory or any other technique or theory. We are not arguing against research to understand
human behaviour. Rather, the focus of this paper is
on the applied usefulness and value of alternative approaches to decision analysis.
A contribution of the paper is to pose a question
that appears to have been absent from the literature
on risk in agriculture: for a risk-averse farmer, what
is the extra value of a recommendation derived from
a model that represents risk aversion, compared to a
model based on risk neutrality? For many examples,
the answer seems to be, very little.
Certainly the study of risk and its implications for
farm management is intrinsically interesting, challeng-

ing and currently often publishable. However, a critical assessment of the literature reveals that the aspects
of agricultural risk most commonly researched and
published often are issues of secondary importance in
determining how farms are managed. The models and
outcomes of much current risk management research
are not readily applicable to farmers. There is a need
for our discipline to assess the needs of our audiences
more carefully.
