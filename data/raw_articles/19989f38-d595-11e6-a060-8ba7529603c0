Abstract
This paper intends to estimate tbe potential impact of climate change on Taiwan's agricultural sector. Yield response regression models are used to investigate the climate change's impact on 60 crops. A price-endogenous mathematical programming
model is tben used to simulate tbe welfare impacts of yield changes under various climate change scenarios. Results suggest
that both warming and climate variations have a significant but non-monotonic impact on crop yields. Society as a whole
would not suffer from warming, but a precipitation increase may be devastating to farmers.© 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

1. Introduction

Agriculture has been a central focus of policy discussions and research projects dealing with economic
effects of greenhouse gas emission control strategies.
Climate is a major determinant of both the location
and productivity of agricultural activities. Significant research efforts are now underway to investigate
agriculture's ability to adapt, because it is important
to "understand how much to control global greenhouse gas emissions and to gauge what actions would
make agriculture more resilient" (Reilly, 1999, p. 4).
Considerable progress has been made in evaluating the potential effects of climate change on global
agriculture (Kane et al., 1992; Rosenzweig and Parry,
1994; Darwin et al., 1995). However, significant uncertainties remain (Reilly, 1995) and concern has

shifted to regional effects (e.g. Adams et al., 1990,
1993; Mendelsohn et al., 1994 on US agriculture) or
farm-level impacts (e.g. Kaiser et al., 1993; Easterling
et al., 1993). Adams et al. (1998) provides a thorough review on the similarities and differences in the
research of climate change on agriculture. In general, the economic effects vary across both crops and
regions, just as the changes in physical crop yields
do. Including human adaptive responses is critical to
a valid assessment and in some cases even reverses
the direction of the net economic effect.
The literature reviewed by Adams et al. (1998) concentrates on the CERES family of crops (Ritchie et al.,
1989) produced in North and Latin American countries, because empirical assessment for other crops
produced elsewhere in the world is sparse. While the
consensus is that the potential for crop yield reduction is greatest in warmer, lower latitude areas and
semi-arid areas of the world (cited in Rosenzweig and
Iglesias, 1994; IPCC, 1996 and Smith et al., 1996),

the economic consequences of crop yield reductions
in these areas are largely unexplored. To fill this empirical gap, this study evaluates the potential impacts
from climate change on the agricultural sector of an
economy located in the semi-tropical area-Taiwan.
The results illustrate not only the sensitivity of agriculture to climate change in this area, but also the
possible economic outcomes which can assist us in
understanding the importance of the adaptive behavior
that is available to cope with these changes.
Taiwan is situated between 21.7 and 25.5° northem latitude and has a total area of 3.6 million ha. A
central mountain chain runs along the vertical axis of
the island, with the land rising from a lOOm foothill
to a mountain range of 3000 m being only within a
horizontal distance of 50-60 km. Thus, the location
of this mountain chain determines the distribution of
agricultural land. The total cultivated land in 1996
was 0.87 millionha, or 24% of the total land area,
with paddy fields amounting to 0.46 million ha and
dryland 0.41 millionha. Of all the paddy fields, about
75% are in the irrigated area managed by the irrigation association.
Taiwan's subtropical weather permits the growing
of a great variety of crops. In the summer months the
temperature in southern and northern Taiwan is almost
identical (27-28 °C). During the winter months, the
mean temperature is about 5 oc higher in the south
(20 °C) than that in the north (15 °C). Although, the
rainfall distribution is profoundly affected by topography, the annual rainfall in the main crop production area ranges from 1500 to 2000mm, with rainfall
abundant throughout the island from May to October.
During the winter months, the rainy season prevails in
the northern and eastern regions while the central and
southern parts of the west coast have dry and sunny
weather. Given warm and humid weather, many kinds
of crops can be grown to produce a wide variety of
farm products on the island (Cheng, 1975).
In this study we will adopt the "structural" approach
in Adams et al. (1999) which incorporates the yield
effects of climate change directly into a sector-wide
economic model with various levels of farm adaptation possibilities. We start by using multiple regression
models to investigate the impact of climate change
on Taiwan's crop yields. The coefficient estimates are
used to predict yield changes under alternative climate
change scenarios. An empirical Taiwan agricultural

sector model (hereafter called TASM) is then employed to evaluate the impact of crop yield changes
on agricultural production, land use, welfare distribution, as well as the potentials for agriculture to adapt
to climate changes.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2
presents the empirical results of the crop yield response regressions. In Section 3 an overview of
the structure and data of TASM are illustrated. In
Section 4 the welfare implications of alternative climate change scenarios are evaluated and Section 5
summarizes the results.

2. Yield response regression
Several previous studies have estimated the impact
of climate on crop yields, however, most studies have
focused on selected crops (e.g. Andresen and Dale,
1989; Dixon et al., 1994; Kaufmann and Snell, 1997
on com; Wu, 1996 on rice). Inter-crop comparisons
are not available. To facilitate our sector-wide evaluation, a comprehensive crop yield response study for
60 crops is conducted for Taiwan.
Crop yield response models are typically estimated
from field data using the measurement of climate and
non-climate-related variables to identify the physical
effect of climate change on yield. To consider farmers'
adaptation, this paper adopts a multiple regression
model for crop yields that integrates the physical and
social determinants of yield. Average yields from 15
sub-regions (or prefectures) in Taiwan for the years
1977 through 1996 are used in our regressions. The
general form of this model is given by Eq. (1) as
follows: 1
yield= f(climate, technology, management, land)

1 Price variables are not included in our model, because we
did not adopt the duality approach as done in Segerson and
Dixon (1999). Therefore, our yield estimates should be viewed as
short-term predictions. No adaptation in management practices to
offset the negative impact of climate change is considered here.
Therefore, some overestimation on the negative effect (or underestimation on the positive) of climate change might occur. However, adaptations are allowed in terms of changing crop mixes in
the later part of our analysis when TASM is used to simulate the
effect of climate change on land usage and welfare distribution.

C.-C. Chang/Agricultural Economics 27 (2002) 51-64

where yield is per acre yield, climate and land represent climate and soil conditions and do not lend
themselves to control by decision makers.
In this study average temperature and precipitation
are considered as the major climate factors, with the
average slope being used as a proxy for the characteristics of land. Both technology and management are
considered as systematic factors under the control of
producers. Time trend is used to represent the level of
technology. The management factor associated with
crop yield is proxied by the ratio of full-time farm
households to total farm households in the area. This
variable intends to capture the extent to which farm
operators in a given area devote their effort to farming and derive their livelihood from it (Segerson and
Dixon, 1999).
Under the general setup, a seasonal regression
model is specified to reflect the relationship between
weather and the growth stage of crops as follows:
Y

=f

(TEMPs, TEMP;, RAINs, RAIN;, VTEMPs,

VRAINs, MANAs, TIME, SLOPE)
where subscripts s (s = 1-4) are the seasonal identifiers. The explanatory variables include: TEMPs,
seasonal mean of monthly average temperature (0 C);
RAINs, seasonal mean of monthly average precipitation (mm); VTEMPs, variation of seasonal mean temperature from 20 years seasonal average; VRAINs,
variation of seasonal mean precipitation from 20 years
seasonal average; MANA, percentage of full-time in
total farm households (%), TIME, time trend; and
SLOPE, land slope (% ).
This model adopts a non-linear specification for
each climate variable where linear and quadratic
terms are used as regressors, reflecting the effect
of a physiological optimum on yield. For example, a positive coefficient for the linear term and
a negative coefficient for the quadratic term indicate that an intermediate value has the greatest positive effect on yield (Kaufmann and Snell,
1997). It also allows for a non-monotonic relationship between climate and yield, i.e. a warming
up might increase crop yields in cooler areas but
decrease yields in warmer regions (Segerson and
Dixon, 1999). However, collinearity problems arise
from inclusion of these quadratic terms. Therefore,
the results should be interpreted carefully and the

significance level of the coefficient estimates are
unreliable.
Variations on temperature (VTEMs) and precipitation (VRAINs) from their historical means are also
included to capture the effect of an extreme event
on yield. 2 Previous studies (e.g. Shaw et al., 1994;
Mendelsohn et al., 1996) show that omitting the variation terms biased the effect of the global warming.
Therefore, these climate variation terms are added in
our yield regression model.
A semi-logrithmic functional form is used where
all the independent variables (except the time trend
variable) are transformed by taking their logs. The
model is estimated with pooled time-series and
cross-sectional data for 59 crops from 15 sub-regions
over the period 1977-1996. Table 1 displays the
regional and sub-regional specifications. Taiwan is
divided into four major crop regions by geographical locations, and within each region there are 3-4
sub-regions. The data on crop yields are drawn from
the Taiwan Agricultural Yearbook. Monthly weather
data on temperature and precipitation are obtained
from Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau. Annual data
on the number of full-time and total farm households
are taken from the Taiwan Agricultural Yearbook.
Data on slopes are calculated by averaging the data
reported in The Statistics and Graphical Summary of
the Soil Conditions and Proper Cropping Systems in
Taiwan's Cultivated Land (Lin and Tsai, 1994).
2 It should be noted that there exist alternative specifications
for the climate variation variable. The variables used in our study
are measured differently from those in Mendelsohn et al' s. (1999)
study. We calculate the deviations of seasonal average temperatures and precipitation from their corresponding sample means for
each sample period, while Mendelsohn et a!. (1999) use the difference between the highest and lowest month! y temperatures and
precipitation over the entire sample period in their cross-section
study. Although, the main concern in both studies is about the
extreme event, the measures differ due to differences in model
scope and data availability.

The summary statistics are presented in Table 2.
Over the past 20 years, the temperature variation is
obviously less dramatic than the variations in precipitation. In Figs. 1 and 2, regional differences on annual
average temperature and precipitation are presented.
Both the southern and eastern regions have above average temperature, while their precipitation levels are
mostly below average.
Since the pooling data is used, the error terms
may be correlated across time and individual units.
Thus, the error terms consist of three components:
a cross-section, a time-series, and a combined error
component. We adopt the assumption that the error terms are cross-sectionally independent, but are
timewise autocorrelated. A generalized least square
procedure described in Kmenta (1986, pp. 618-622)
is used to obtain consistent estimates. 3
For most crops, the model tends to have pretty
good explanatory power as measured by the Buse

sorghum, soybeans, potato, several vegetables (scallop

bulb, cabbage, etc.) and fruits (grape, apple, coconut,
etc.), the model does not perform very well.
For the non-climate variables, the management factor (i.e. the percentage of full-time farms) has a very
significant and positive impact on yields for most
crops. Steeper land slopes are harmful to many crop
yields, in particular vegetables. Technology has, as
expected, a positive and significant effect on yields in
most cases.
As for the climate variables, since both linear and
quadratic terms are included in the model, elasticities are calculated to identify their marginal yield impacts at the sample means. The results are shown
in Table 3. For rice (Taiwan's most important staple
crop), warmer temperatures and increased precipitation are mostly yield-decreasing. A number of studies
are also conducted on the impact of climate change
on rice yield using the data from field and/or laboratory controlled-experiments and various crop simulation models for many different countries. Matthews
et al. (1995) conclude that many uncertainties exist due
to uncertainties in climate predictions, limited sites for
which historical weather data are available, and quality of the crop simulation models. Nevertheless, the
result that a warming up would adversely affect rice
yield is quite consistent with those in Horie (1991) for
Japan and Wu (1996) for Taiwan.
A warming up also tends to be harmful to soybeans, adzuki beans, sugarcane, and many fruits like
bananas, pineapples, grapes, apples, etc. As for vegetables, temperature increases in the first and fourth
quarters are mostly favorable, but while it is not in the
second quarter. Too much rain is also unfavorable to
their yields. Tomato yields are found to positively related to a temperature increase, and this is quite similar to the pattern used in Adams et al's. (1999) study
for US agriculture.
The climate impacts on citrus fruit vary by species.
A temperature rise is favorable for ponkan, tankan and
wentan, but not for liucheng, lemon and grapefruits.
The yield changes used in Adams et al. (1999) (originally estimated by Ben-Mechlia and Carroll (1989a,b)
using the crop simulation models) for citrus produced
in the US show that a warming up may cause some
decreases in the southern regions, but shows increases
at more northerly sites. Our results suggest that differences in species should also be taken into account
beside locations.

Climate variations are lastly found to have a significant yield impact on many crops like corn, peanut,
sorghum, sugarcane, sesame, scallop bulb, bamboo,
cucumber, cantaloupe, banana, etc. Relatively speaking, temperature variations seem to be more favorable to yields, while precipitation variations are mostly
yield-decreasing. The latter is, to some extent, consistent with the findings in Shaw et al. (1994) and
Mendelsohn et al. (1996). In other words, changes in
rainfall patterns can be beneficial over some ranges,
but detrimental over others.
In the review article by Adams et al. (1998), they
compare the climate effects on grain crops in Latin
and North America derived from various crop simulation models. Their comparison indicates that an important regional trend exists. They also point out that
crop productivity in large areas of Latin America is
negatively affected by the inter-annual variability and
the occurrence of extreme events. Since both warming and greater climate variability are found to have
a significant impact on many crop yields in Taiwan,
their concern on the regional food supply and welfare redistribution are potentially important and, thus,
should be explored. In the following sections we will
investigate the economic implications of these yield
changes.

3. Structure of TASM
In this study a price-endogenous spatial equilibrium model (TASM) is used to evaluate the impact
of crop yield changes on regional production, land
use, welfare distribution, as well as the potentials for
agriculture to adapt to climate changes. This section
describes the structure of TASM. The TASM is formulated in a multi-product partial equilibrium framework
based on the previous work ofBaumes (1978); Burton
and Martin (1987); McCarl and Spreen (1980); Chang
et al. (1992); Coble et al. (1992) and Tanyeri-Abur et
al. (1993). The empirical structure has been adapted to
Taiwan and used in a number of policy-related studies,
e.g. Chang and Chen (1995) and Chang (1999). The
current version of TASM accommodates more than
90 commodities for four major production regions
which can be further divided into 15 sub-regions.
Under the perfect competitive and price-taking assumptions, price-dependent product demand and input
supply curves are used to replicate market operations.
First, we assume that there exists I agricultural commodities which are produced inK regions through production activities (i = 1, 2, ... , I; k = 1, 2, ... , K). The
unit of each activity is a hectare. The total production
in each region can be calculated by multiplying per

C.-C. Chang/Agricultural Economics 27 (2002) 51-64

58

hectare yield with. For product demand, we assume all
commodities are sold in the wholesale markets. The
prices faced by consumers can be represented by the
national average of wholesale prices. Assume demand
functions are integrable and can be represented by the
following inverse demand functions:
i = 1, 2, ... , I

(1)

PP

where Qi is the total quantity of consumption and
the average wholesale price of commodity i.
In the input markets we assume each production
activity must apply M regional inputs (such as land
and labor) and N inputs purchased from the non-farm
sector (such as fertilizer and chemicals). The prices
of N purchased inputs are exogenous. However, the
prices of M regional inputs are endogenously determined by the derived demand from the production
activities and regional supply functions. Assume
regional supply functions are integrable as follows:
P/;,k = ak(Lmk),

m = 1, 2, ... , k

(2)

where P/;,k are user prices of regional inputs and are
the quantity supplied.
The objective function which maximizes the sum
of consumers' surplus plus producers' surpluses is
used to simulate a perfectly competitive market equilibrium following Samuelson (1952); Takayama and
Judge (1964). It is defined as the area between the
product demand and factor supply curves to the left
of their intersection as follows:

max:~

Terms pL, pQ, LK, and Xik are endogenous variables
while Cik. Yik, and.fimk are known parameters.
The following two sets of policy variables are also
added into the model. The first set is used to reflect the
government rice purchase program under a guaranteed
price which is above the market equilibrium price. An
import ban is used to assure farmers a reasonable return. A high guaranteed price and tight restriction on
rice imports stimulate excess production resulting in
a rapid accumulation of surplus rice, a shortage of
elevator space, and an escalating government deficit.
Per hectare limits on rice purchases have been implemented since 1977. Letting P! be the weighted
government guaranteed purchases price and the total
amount of government purchase, the objective function becomes

where Cik is the purchased input cost in region k used
in producing the ith commodity, Yik the per hectare
yield of ith commodity produced in region k, and.fimk
the demand for the mth regional input in region k.

The total amount from the government rice purchase
program (Pf Q~) is added into the objective function
as additional revenues for the farmers. Eq. (7) represents the modified supply-demand balance condition for rice and Eq. (8) is for other products. Eq. (9)
remains unchanged.
The second set of policy variables relates to the
trade protection instruments in Taiwan. Taiwan's
import/export share in the world market is very small.
Therefore, import and export prices are assumed to be
exogenously determined by supply and demand in the
world market. The net trade balances are added into
the objective function directly to reflect the welfare

In Eq. (10) the net trade values are added into the
objective function, where pm and px are import and
export prices, and Qm and Qx are export and import
quantities, respectively. There are two types of commodity balance equations, one for traded and the other
for non-traded products. In Eq. (11) the demand of a
traded product is the sum of domestic demand (Qf)
and export demand ( Qj ), where the supply side includes the import supply (Qm )and domestic supply
(L,kYfkXfk)- Eq. (12) represents the demand-supply
balance of non-traded goods as Eq. (13) remains the
same.
Currently, two trade protection instruments (quota
and tariff) are used to protect domestic farm products.
The quota systems are imposed on the imports of rice,
sugar, pork, and poultry, etc. The import of beef and
fruits are under a tariff protection system. In the model
the former is handled by imposing an upper bound
for the import quantity while the latter is treated by
adding an import tax upon domestic prices.
The TASM includes 60 crops, 5 floral crops, 7
livestock, 3 types of forests (conifers, hardwoods,
and bamboo) and 17 secondary commodities (including two timber products: conifer-timber and
hardwood-timber). The total value of the primary
commodities accounts for 85% of Taiwan's total value

of agricultural product. Table 4 provides the list of
commodity coverage. Sub-regional production activities are specified in the model for each commodity.
Crop, livestock and forestry mixes activities and constraints are also specified at the sub-regional level, but
the input markets for cropland, pasture land, forest
land, and farm labor are specified at the regional level.
The data sources largely come from published government statistics and research reports, which include
the Taiwan Agricultural Yearbook, Production Cost
and Income of Farm Products Statistics, Commodity
Price Statistics Monthly, Taiwan Agricultural Prices
and Costs Monthly, Taiwan Area Agricultural Products Wholesale Market Yearbook, Trade Statistics of
the Inspectorate-General of Customs, Forestry Statistics of Taiwan. Demand elasticities of agricultural
products comes from various sources. They are listed
in the Appendix of Lin (1996).
The empirical model is validated based on the comparison between the equilibrium solution and actual
statistics. The year 1994 was chosen as the baseline to
construct the database, and we use both the total production and prices as the basis to validate our model. It
is found that most of the discrepancies between model
results and 1994 data are within 5% range and thus
the model should be valid for our simulation.

in Table 3 are used to predict yield changes. Table 5

scenarios, which include 0, + 1.5, +2.5 oc for temperature and -10, 0, + 7 and+ 15% for precipitation.
Because the data used in our study do not allow for
an estimation of the effects of changes in C02, all
scenarios assume no change in the C02 level and
thus include no C02 fertilization effects. We also
assume that the temperature or precipitation change
occurs in all four seasons. Thus, in each scenario all
seasonal variables are adjusted simultaneously by the
same amounts. Floral crops in TASM are assumed
to be unaffected by climate changes since most of
them are cultivated inside greenhouses. Livestock and
poultry production in Taiwan has been transformed
from backyard sideline operations into large business enterprises and mostly produced in the confined
environment. Due to limited exposure to the outside
environment, their yields as such are also assumed to
be unaffected by climate changes.
Another major impact of climate change involves
input adjustment related to yield levels. Input usage is
adjusted by the percentage change in yield times an
output elasticity expressing the response of input usage to a percentage change in yield. Arc elasticity of
input for selected crops in each sub-region is calculated using 1982 and 1972 production and crop budget data (Chang and Chen, 1995). An upper and lower
bound of 2.0 and -2.0 are set, respectively, for elasticities beyond this range. In addition to changes in
the input usage coefficients, the profit margin of each
crop budget appearing in the objective function is also
adjusted according to the percentage change in yield.
Using these projected yield changes and adjustments in input usage and profit margins, the economic implications of each of the 11 climate change
scenarios are evaluated using the TASM outlined in
Section 3. The percentage changes in consumers' and
producers' welfare from the 1984 baseline are used
to represent the welfare effect of the climate change.
These changes are reported in Table 6. Our welfare
results suggest that the climate impacts on welfare
are mostly positive except for the first three scenarios
where no temperature increase is assumed. This optimistic result can be attributable largely to the flexibility in TASM that allows farmers to change their crop
mixes and land use pattern for adaptation.
Table 7 illustrates the changes in land use pattern in
each climate change scenario. The total crop acreage
decreases about 1-6% in the warming up scenarios.

Given the very limited availability of arable land in
Taiwan, farmers can generate more welfare from intensified land usage. In addition, from the percentage
component results as shown in Table 7, there exists
significant structural change, with planting acreage
declining for cereal crops. On the other hand, the
percentages on vegetables, pulse, and special crops increase. Therefore, given the possibility of adaptations,
a climate change has the potential to encourage more
production of vegetables and speciality crops. The
shifts from traditional crops to higher value-added
crops also contribute to the relatively large expansions
on producers' welfare.
In the latter eight scenarios climate change seems
to have a similar relative magnitude and pattern of impacts under both 1.5 and 2.5 oc temperature increase
scenarios. In both sets of scenarios, producers' welfare gains are much more dramatic than consumers'
in percentage terms. The results also indicate that the
two climate variables have different implications for
consumers and producers. Temperature increases have
potential to bring more benefits than precipitation increases do. However, for consumers, the benefits are
not monotonic. A moderate warming up is likely to be
welfare-enhancing for consumers while a harsh temperature rise may result in their welfare losses. Producers are better off from a more dramatic rise, but
too much rainfall tends to reduce producers' welfare.
The overall societal welfare implications of a warming up are similar to those reported in Adams et al.
(1999). Both studies show that a moderate warming

up benefits society as a whole, but benefits fall as temperature rises beyond a 1.5 oc change. However, the
implications of more precipitation are different. More
precipitation appears to be beneficial for producers in
the US, but not necessarily so for those in Taiwan.
The results on producers are also very similar to the
recent findings in Mendelsohn et al. (1999) in which
the Ricardian approach is used to evaluate the relationship between net farm values and climate change.
In the earlier one by Mendelsohn et al. (1996) they
find that aggregate farm value in the U.S. with a temperate climate pattern is hill-shaped with a maximum
of 63°F. Thus, they predict that only a small increase
in temperature raises farm values so that countries in
temperate and polar regions benefit while countries
in subtropical and tropical areas will suffer losses.
However, in their 1999 study climate variations are
added into their regression model and the new results
show that temperature increases are strictly beneficial
to farm values in the US.

22

In our study climate variations are also added into
our yield response estimates. Similar monotonic effects on producers' welfare are found. The possible
explanation is that climate change may induce changes
in crop mixes and land use pattern, along with the realignments in market prices. Still, great caution should
be taken when applying these response functions to a
climate change outside the range of data used here.

5. Concluding remarks
This paper basically researches the impact of climate change on the agricultural activities in the
semi-tropical area using Taiwan as an example. The
methodology involves a two-step procedure. First,
pooling data on crop yields and climate and other
non-climate-related variables are used to estimate
yield response equations. The yield equations are
used to simulate the physical impacts of alternative

C.-C. Chang I Agricultural Economics 27 (2002) 51-64

climate change scenarios on per hectare yields. This
approach addresses farmer's adjustments to environmental conditions and thus provides relatively more
realistic estimates of the magnitude of climate impacts
than do traditional agronomic crop weather models.
Our empirical results on 60 crops in Taiwan show
that, in general, the two climate variables (temperature and precipitation) have a significant and
non-monotonic impact on crop yields. Climate variations also have significant implications on many crop
yields, similar to those found in the US. Therefore,
incorporating climate variations should be important
in studying climate impacts on agriculture in subtropical and tropical regions. The impact of other
tropical climatic anomalies, such as cyclones, El
Nino-southern-oscillation and hurricanes, are also
very critical to the well-being in these regions and
should be explored in the future. In addition, since
seasonal difference are found when examining the impact of climate on crop yields, future research would
benefit with the availability of data on the time intervals when crops enter into their various growth stages
as well as the growth-stage-related climate data.
In our second step the predicted yield changes are
incorporated into a model of the Taiwanese agricultural sector where prices are endogenously determined
and farmer's adaptations are allowed by varying crop
mixes, land use pattern and input uses in response to
price and yield changes. The welfare implications of
various climate change scenarios are examined. The
comparison result suggests that climate change impacts on welfare are mostly positive. The impacts on
producers are much more significant than they are on
consumers, with the two climate variables found to
also have quite different implications for consumers
and producers. A temperature rise is not stressful to
Taiwan's farmers, and may even be beneficial when
adaptation is taken into account. However, the upward shift in rainfall intensity could be devastating to
farmers' welfare.
The impact of climate change on agriculture is a
very complicated issue. Many analysts predict that
developing countries in tropical and semi-tropical
regions are the most vulnerable to global warming. This paper presents a preliminary evaluation on
Taiwan's relatively modernized agricultural sector.
Unfortunately, because the flexibility in land use,
the ability of farmers to adapt and the existence of

63

adaptation possibilities vary, our results may not be
applicable to other neighboring Asian economies directly. This leads to a number of potential research
directions such as comparing alternative adaptation strategies available in tropical and semitropical
regions.
