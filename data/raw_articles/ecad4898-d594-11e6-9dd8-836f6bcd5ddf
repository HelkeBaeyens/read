Abstract
This paper examines the effects of farm size, soil erosion, and sml conservation investments on land and labor productivity and
allocative efficiency in Rwanda. There were several key results. First, there is a strong inverse relationship between farm size and land
productivity, and the opposite for labor productivity. For smaller farms, there 1s ev1dence of allocative inefficiency in use of land and labor,
probably due to factor market access constraints. Second, farms with greater mvestment in soil conservation have much better land
productivity than average. Those with very eroded soils do much worse than average. Smaller farms are not more eroded than larger farms,
but have twice the soil conservation investments. Third, land productivity benefits substantially from perenmal cash crops, and the gains to
shifting to cash crops are highest for those with low erosion and high use of fertilizer and organic matter. Program and policy effort to
encourage and enable farmers to make soil conservation investments, to use fertilizer and organic matter, and to participate in cash cropping
of perennials will have big payoffs in productivity. Land markets that allow smaller farmers to buy land could also increase aggregate
productivity.

1. Introduction
Research on African farm productivity from the
1960s to the present has focused on differences
between smallholders and largeholders in dual agricultural systems and on differences between technology groups or land tenure status in smallholder
systems 1• Over the past three decades, however,
soils have degraded and erosion has become a major

1970s. Selected studies of farm productivity after that are reviewed below.

environmental problem in many African countries.
Access to land has become increasingly constrained
in smallholder agricultural areas that were formerly
land-abundant.
Study has been rare, however, of how growing
land constraints and degradation have affected farm
productivity in smallholder areas. These effects are
issues of urgent importance in the East African
highland tropics. In Rwanda, for example, population density has risen rapidly over the last three
decades and is now among the highest in Africa, and
poverty is widespread. With increasing land constraints (associated with a secular tendency to smaiier
farms), farmers are increasingly pushing onto the
fragile 'extensive margins', the hillsides (von Braun

et al., 1991; Clay, 1993). Half of the farmland is
moderately to severely degraded. Improving farm
productivity and combatting land degradation are
key food security strategy goals of the Rwandan
Ministry of Agriculture (Commission Nationale
d' Agriculture, 1992).
This paper explores the determinants of farm
productivity in Rwanda, using a nation-wide, 1240
household survey over one year (1990-1991) by the
Rwandan Ministry of Agriculture, Division of Agricultural Statistics (MINAGRijDSA). We address
two questions. First, how does farm size affect land
and labor productivity and allocative efficiency on
smallholder farms? This is one way to approach the
more general question of how increasing land constraints and population density are affecting crop
productivity. Second, how does land degradation,
specifically erosion, affect farm productivity, and
conversely, how do anti-erosion (soil conservation)
investments affect crop productivity?
Our hypotheses are as follows.
First, neither theory nor empirical evidence allows
us to offer an unambiguous hypothesis for the relation between crop productivity and farm size, nor the
relation between farm size and allocative efficiency.
On the one hand, smaller farmers may crop available land more intensively, using more labor, and
fallowing less, whereas large farmers may underuse
land, fallowing more, planting less densely, and using less labor per hectare. Smallholders could face a
virtual wage or opportunity cost of labor that is
lower than the market wage, and apply labor until its
marginal value product becomes a fraction of the
market wage (Ellis, 1993).
There is empirical evidence to support the hypothesis of an inverse relationship between farm size and
land productivity. In India, for example, Bardhan
( 1973) and Deolalikar ( 1981) show that smaller farms
have higher land productivity but lower labor productivity. They point to the greater labor intensity of
smallholder farms as the reason. Empirical tests of
the hypothesis in Africa have tended to focus on
dualistic agricultures with land distribution Gini coefficients in excess of 0.50 (for example, van Zyl et
al., 1995 for maize in South Africa, Carter and
Wiebe, 1990 for wheat in Kenya); they find an
inverse relationship. Tests have been rarer in smallholder agriculture with Gini coefficients for land

distribution in the 0.30-0.40 range. An example is
Barrett ( 1994), who shows an inverse relationship for
rice farmers in Madagascar.
On the other hand, larger farmers could in theory
compensate for less family labor per hectare with
hired labor, non-labor variable inputs, and capital, to
meet or surpass land productivity on small farms.
Adesina et al. ( 1994) show this for large rice farms
in Cote d'lvoire, and Rao and Chotigeat (1981) for
large farms in India. In both cases, larger farms had
better access to capital and nonlabor variable inputs
than do small farms. Moreover, smaller farms might
also have lower land productivity because their more
intensive farming fatigues and degrades the soil. Yet
E11is (1993) notes that a zone with better soils might
attract more farmers, giving rise to smaller farms
with better yields than in other zones.
Moreover, comparisons have been rare of allocative efficiency of small and large farms (testing
whether there is equality between the marginal value
product of a factor and the price of that factor in the
market). Exceptions include Carter and Wiebe (1990)
for Kenya, Adesina et al. (1994) for Cote d'lvoire,
and Savadogo et al. ( 1994) for Burkina Faso. The
Burkina study examined animal traction user and
non-user groups. The Kenya and Cote d'Ivoire studies compared labor and capital marginal value products (MVPs) between smallholders and largeholders,
and compared the MVPs to factor prices. They found
that among smallholders the MVP of capital is wen
above the capital price for sma11holders, and near
equality for largeholders; from this finding they inferred constraints on access to capital among sma11holders. They also found that among sma11holders
the MVP of labor is well under the farm-labor
market wage.
Second, we expect that land degradation reduces
land productivity, and soil conservation investments
raise it. The direction of the hypothesized effect is
common sense, but the empirical importance of the
effect has rarely (particularly in Africa) been examined in developing countries outside of field-station
experiments. A rare example is Bhalla and Roy
(1988), who incorporated farm-land quality (proxied
by soil type, color, and depth) in their analysis of the
relationship between Indian farm size and productivity. Moreover, we expect interaction effects between
land quality, farm size, and farm productivity. Sup-

129

pose small and large farms have equal land quality,
and there is an inverse relation between farm size
and land productivity. Then, if small farms were to
suffer greater land degradation, that would offset the
inverse relationship between farm size and land productivity. If they were to suffer less degradation, it
would magnify the inverse relationship.
We proceed as follows. Section 2 presents methods and data, Section 3, patterns in the data, Section
4, regression results, and Section 5, conGlusions.

2. Methods and data
We use a production function relating output to
inputs and other 'conditioners' reflecting farm and
plot characteristics such as soil erosion. From the
estimates of the function, we compute MVPs of land
and labor. We compare these MVPs with factor
market prices to test for allocative efficiency and
infer constraints in access to inputs. We then regress
the MVPs against conditioning factors such as farm
size and degree of soil erosion.

where {3 s are coefficients, x, inputs, z, conditioning
factors, and D, dummy variables.
2.2. Data
The data used are from a survey with weekly
observations over 1990-1991, aggregated to a oneyear cross section. The sample is a nationwide stratified-random sample of 1240 farm households, operating 6464 plots. The baseline survey covered inputs
and outputs to cropping, and other plot and farm
characteristics, but did not: (1) enumerate allocation
of own-and hired-labor to specific crops; (2) enumerate allocation of purchased inputs (fertilizer, pesticides, lime) to specific fields or crops; (3) directly
observe levels of soil erosion. (We calculated erosion
from plot characteristics and other data; see below.)
The baseline data are supplemented by data from the
one-shot, plot-level, 1991 Agroforestry Survey which
enumerated soil conservation measures taken by the
same sample of households interviewed in the baseline survey.

2.3. Regression specification
2.1. Production function form
The specification retained is as follows
We use an unrestricted translog production function because it is general and flexible and allows
analysis of interactions among variables (Antle and
Capalbo, 1988) 2 • The Cobb-Douglas is a special
case of the translog, when the interaction terms have
zero coefficients. But unlike the Cobb-Douglas, the
translog function does not always generate elasticities of substitution of one, and the isoquants and
marginal products derived from the translog depend
on the coefficients on the interaction terms (Debertin, 1986) 3 . The general form is:

4•

In( OUTPUT)= {3 0 + {3 1lnLABOR + {3 2 lnLAND

In y = {3 0 + .!; {3; In X; + .!J {3JZJ + .!; .!; {3)n X ;In X;

(1)

2 Our use of the unrestricted form avoids problems of inflexibility of the translog under restrictions, discussed in Driscoll et al.
(1992).
3 The marginal product of x
1 in the trans log model is given as
follows in a two-input model with output y: MPP of x 1 =
y[ /3 1 j x 1 + T /2 In x 2 (I/ x 1)). Debertin (1986), p. 208.

4 The retained regressors were tested for exogeneity using the
procedure in Rivers and Vuong (1988), and they were all found
exogenous. To reduce the computational burden, we discarded
variables not significant statistically (at 10%) or important economically. The variables dropped included the quadratic terms for
labor and land, and interaction terms that included FRAGMENT,
AGEFARM, DISTANCE, RENTED, and dummies for SOUTHWEST, NORTHCENTER, and EAST. We tested and rejected (at
5%) the hypothesis that the coefficients on these rejected variables
are different from zero.

OUTPUT is the value of crops produced (the sum
over crops, the output of each of which is weighted
by the market price at harvest 1990). The aggregate
is used because, although our data show allocation of
land to specific crops, we lack data on labor and
fertilizer allocation per crop. Moreover, most Rwandan farms have a large share of land in mixed
cropping.
Bardhan (1973) notes, however, that such aggregation overlooks the effect of crop mix and that
differences in aggregate productivity between small
and large farms are attributed to size or returns to
scale while in reality they are the result of the crop
composition of output. That is, farmers who grow
crops with higher market prices appear to be more
'productive' than others who may produce the same
physical yields, but of crops with lower market
value. We address this problem by controlling for
crop mix, with the proxy being the share of 'high
value crops' (SHAREHVC), bananas and coffee, in
the gross value of output. These are 'cash perennial
crops' that tend also to protect the soil better than
(semi-subsistence) annual crops, such as grains, tubers, roots, and pulses.
LABOR is expressed in adult-equivalent-days per
hectare, and is the sum of family labor and hired
labor. It is treated as exogenous because it is mainly
family labor from family size and composition data 5•
LAND is hectares of cultivated land. It treated as
exogenous because 90% of farmed land is owned,
not rented, landholdings are set by traditional land
rights, and there is no formal land market for purchase and sale.

5 Available labor for the household in person-days per hectare
(total family labor+ labor hired -labor sold) is standardized into
adult equivalents (AE): I for adults (aged between 16 and 60) and
0.25 for children (between 6 and 15) and seniors (above 60).

All farmers use hoe and machete and none uses
animal traction. There is very little use of chemical
fertilizer, lime, and pesticides (see Section 3). Soil
fertility is maintained mainly by fallow and use of
manure. We lack data on quantities of fertilizer and
manure used. For simplicity, we assume that plots
are equally fertilized, and use a proxy variable,
FERTSHARE, the share of cultivated area on which
manure, compost, chemical fertilizer, lime, or pesticide is used.
FRAGMENT, the number of plots, reflects farm
fragmentation. DISTANCE is the average time the
farmer must travel from the residence to the plots
(averaged over plots, weighted by plot area). We
expect that the more plots the farm has, and the more
distant they are from the residence, the less productive is the farm operation.
Two variables reflect soil quality, AGEFARM
and EROSION. AGEFARM is the average number
of years since cultivation began on currently farmed
plots (averaged over plots, weighted by plot area).
We expect older plots to be less productive.
EROSION is the average annual soil loss in tons
ha- 1 per farm (averaged over plots, weighted by
plot area). It is calculated using the Universal Soil
Loss Equation, the USLE (Morgan, 1986; Hudson,
1993). Using the survey data and secondary data 6 ,
one index per plot is calculated as the product of the
following indices: (I) rainfall and runoff; (2) soil
erodibility; (3) length of the plot (compared with a
standard field of 22.6 m); (4) slope of the plot
relative to a standard (9%); (5) C-value (the ratio of
soil loss on a plot under a standard treatment of
cultivated bare fallow compared to the soil loss
expected from the crop mix and cropping practice
used on the current plot); (6) soil conservation practices expressed as the ratio of the soil loss of the plot
(given soil conservation measures used thereon) to
that of a plot with no conservation practice.
Land RENTED is the share of cultivated area
rented per household. Our hypothesis is ambiguous
as to its effect. On the one hand, we expect that
farmers invest less effort in improving rented plots.
On the other hand, farmers usually seek to rent the
best land available.

Dummy variables are used to capture effects of
agroclimatic zone. The zone dummy variables are
NORTHWEST, SOUTHWEST, NORTHCENTER,
and EAST. The constant of the function contains the
effect of the SOUTHCENTER zone. The zones follow the delineation given by Clay and Dejaegher
(1987). They differ by rainfall, altitude, soil quality,
crop mix, and vegetal cover. The Northwest zone
covers the volcanic highlands and the upper parts of
Lake Kivu's shore and the Zaire-Nile divide. It has
high rainfall, relatively small farms, and soils with
low organic matter. The Southwest, Northcenter, and
Southcenter are similar, with low yields, smaller
farms, and poor, degraded soils. The East is a low
altitude plain, with less rainfall and bigger farms,
more fertile soils, and was recently colonized. In
general, the western zones are rainier and higher
altitude, with soils that have been farmed much
longer than those to the east.

farms grouped according to relative farm size: 'smallest', averaging 0.34 ha; 'middle', 0.83 ha; 'largest',
2.38 ha 7 . Despite its name, the 'largest' tercile
farms are still much smaller than farms in other
agroecological regions of Africa outside the tropical
highlands. But the average largest-tercile farm is
seven times larger than the average smallest-tercile
farm. The largest tercile holds 68% of the land,
compared with only 10% by the smallest. The Gini
coefficient of landholding is 0.38.
Compared with the largest farms, the smallest
farms: (1) have three times higher land-yields in
value terms; (2) use four times more labor per
hectare; (3) have four times the number of plots per
hectare (hence the farms are more fragmented); (4)
have fanned the holding for fewer years; (5) have
plots clustered closer to the domicile; (6) have nearly
twice the share of land rented; (7) have only slightly
less eroded soils; (8) have twice as much soil conservation investment per hectare; (9) use the same (tiny)
amount of chemical fertilizer; and (10) have about

3. Patterns
Table 1 shows patterns in outputs, inputs, and plot
and farm characteristics compared across terciles of

7 The smallest tercile has farms less than 0.58 ha; the middle,
between 0.58 and 1.45; the largest, greater than 1.45 ha.

132

the same share of land under 'high valued crops'
(coffee and bananas).
That the smallest farms are at present no more
eroded than the largest farms may be due to the
farms' being newer and receiving more soil conservation investment. They are not, on average over the
country, husbanded more carefully in terms of receiving more soil amendments or having more of
their area planted to the land-protecting perennials,
bananas and coffee. Nor do they have the option of
fallowing as much as larger farmers do. As these
smallest farms age, one can expect in the long term
for them to suffer greater soil degradation - unless
this is obviated by more use of soil amendments and
more land under perennials.

4. Regression results
4.1. The determinants of production
Table 2 shows production regression results. We
discuss only significant coefficients. Effects are in
general as expected. Positive effects on the aggregate
value of crop output are produced by LAND, LABOR, and SHAREHVC, being in the NORTHCENTER and the EAST, and by the interaction of LABOR and the NORTHWEST, and by LAND and the
NORTHWEST. Negative effects are produced by the
interaction of LAND and EROSION, by AGEFARM, by being in the NORTHWEST, and by the
interaction of LABOR and FERTSHARE (the last
being unexpected).
4.2. Average and marginal value products and their
determinants
Table 3 shows average value products (AVPs)
and marginal value products (MVPs) of land and
labor. They are calculated taking into account the
sole effects of the factor plus the effects of its
interactions with other variables.
The A VP and the MVP of land (labor) decrease
(increase) as the farm-size tercile increases. Bhalla
(1988) notes, however, that an observed inverse
relationship between farm size and the MVP or AVP
of land can depend on how one stratifies the sample.
To test the robustness of our findings, and to see

how the MVPs are affected by other variables, we
specified the following function quadratic in land 8 :
MVP (land; labor)

= f3o

+ f3 1LAND + {3 2 LAND 2 + {3 3 EROSION

+ {34 SOILCONS + {35 FERTSHARE

+ {36 SHAREHVC + {3 7 NORTHWEST + u
(3)
Table 4 shows regression results for (3). They
show a strong inverse relationship between farm size
(LAND) and the MVP of land, and a positive relationship between farm size and the MVP of labor.
The relations are U-shaped. EROSION has a strong
negative effect on the land MVP, but the effect on
labor's is not significant. The effect of SOILCONS
on the land MVP is strong and significant, but the
effect on the labor MVP is not. In contrast to its
insignificant or counter-intuitive effects on output,
here FERTSHARE improves land productivity, as
expected. NORTHWEST zone farmers also have
greater land productivity after controlling for farm
size, probably due to the rich soils and high rainfall.
A greater SHAREHVC also strongly increases both
land and labor productivity in value terms.
Table 3 also compares the MVPs of land and
labor with factor prices - the market wage and the
land rental rate (as a proxy for the market price of
land). Observe that the farmers in the smallest-farms
tercile apply labor until the labor MVP is only a
third of the market wage compared to two-thirds for
the largest farms. This implies a 'bottling-up' of
labor on the smallest farms, with a lower opportunity
cost of labor than that reflected in the farm labor
market. This may be due to constraints to access to
that labor market as well as to nonagricultural employment opportunities.
On the smallest-tercile farms, the land MVP is
much higher than the land rental rate, indicating
constraints on access to land. By contrast, for the
largest farms, the land MVP and the rental rate come
near equality.

8 We tested for correlation between SOILCONS and EROSION
and rejected multicollinearity.

We then controlled for all other variables and
varied each of several key conditioning variables to
see its effects on the MVPs of labor and land. Table

focus on the effects on the land MVPs, as land is the
scarcest factor. The effects on the labor MVPs are
included in the tables for reference.
First, when EROSION increases from low to high,
Table 5a shows the land MVP decreases 30%. Table
5b shows that on farms with a high SHAREHVC (of
cash perennials, coffee and bananas) and high
FERTSHARE, the effect of moving from low to high
EROSION is only 24%. With a low SHAREHVC
(hence a high share of annual crops, which have high
C-values, which make land more erodible) and low
FERTSHARE, increasing EROSION from low to
high has a large impact, 51%.

Second, when SOILCONS (soil conservation investment per hectare) increases from low to high,
Table 5a shows that the land MVP increases by 21%.
Table 5e compares over farms using a triple stratification (low and high EROSION, SHAREHVC, and
FERTSHARE), holding all else constant. The farms

that benefit most from soil conservation investment
are those with high EROSION, low SHAREHVC
(again implying a high share of annual crops, which
protect the soil less than the cash perennials), and
low or high FERTSHARE. The effect of moving
from low to high SOILCONS is 42% and 35%,

F. Byiringiro, T. Reardon/ Agricultural Economics 15 (1996) 127-136

respectively for low and high FERTSHARE. Those
that benefit least are those with low EROSION, high
SHAREHVC, and low or high FERTSHARE. The
effect of moving from low to high SOILCONS is to
increase land MVP only 15% for high FERTSHARE
and 18% for low. Hence, from the viewpoint of the
reduction of erosion and improvement of land fertility, producing cash perennials and investments in
soil conservation are to a certain extent substitutes.
Third, when FERTSHARE increases from low to
high, hence more cultivated land receives chemical
fertilizer andjor organic matter, Table 5a shows that
the land MVP rises by 15%. Table 5c shows that on
farms with high EROSION and low SHAREHVC,
the gain in land MVP in moving from low to high
FERTSHARE can be as high as 44%. Hence, the
need for soil amendments is greatest where land is
already eroded and annual crops are intensively
cropped and thus there is need for replacement of
soil nutrients.
Fourth, when SHAREHVC increases from low to
high, hence perennial cash cropping increases in
importance, Table 5d shows that the impact is quite
high on land MVP (92%) (the cash perennials coffee
and bananas pay so much more than food annuals
such as beans and tubers and grain). The effect is
highest where farm conditions are good - when
EROSION is low and FERTSHARE is high, and
lowest (39%) when farm conditions are poor (high
EROSION, low FERTSHARE). Hence, producers of
cash perennials have incentive to improve farm conditions, although producing bananas and coffee is
itself a fertility-enhancing and soil-protecting measure.

5. Conclusions
This paper addressed the issue of how growing
population pressure and land constraints - which
translate into tiny farms and land erosion - affect
land and labor productivity. We explored: (1) whether
the smaller farms have greater average and marginal
land productivity than the larger farms, and whether
the smaller farms are less allocatively efficient; and
(2) whether and how much soil erosion reduces, and
soil conservation investments increase, land productivity. Both queries were answered with a strong

135

affirmative. Moreover, the inverse relationship is not
mitigated by the smaller farms' being more eroded,
despite their farming more intensively (with less
fallow). In fact, smaller farms are not more eroded
than larger farms. Moreover, the inverse relationship
is not mitigated by larger farms' using more nonlabor inputs or by their putting more of their land
under cash perennials. In fact, larger farms do not do
more of either compared to smaller farms.
Moreover, we find the marginal value product of
land on smaller farms to be well above the rental
price of land, implying factor use inefficiency and
constraints to land access. By contrast, the marginal
value product of labor on smaller farms was weii
below the market wage. This implies a 'bottling up'
of labor on smaiier farms, and constraints to access
to labor market opportunities, and perhaps barriers to
entry into smaii business. Hence, attention to the
reform of land markets is needed even in situations
where land size distribution is only moderately unequal and absolute farm sizes are small. Attention to
ways to increase smaii farmers' access to the labor
market will help employ 'surplus' household labor
while providing more income to the poor.
The smailest-tercile farms do at least one thing
quite differently to offset their being able to faiiow
much less. They invest twice as much per hectare in
soil conservation compared with the largest-tercile
farms. The biggest gainers from such investments are
farms with a high share of annual food crops, high
erosion, and low fertilization rates. Those that gain
the least are those with a high share of perennial
cash crops and low erosion. While it pays perennial
cash crop producers to enhance farm conditions, to a
certain extent producing coffee and bananas is a
substitute for costly conservation investments (because bananas and coffee retain soil and provide
cover). Cash cropping also strongly increases smaiiholder incomes.
But only one-third of farmland (in ail strata) is
under cash perennials. For the rest of the land (under
semi-subsistence grains, legumes, and roots and tubers), the gross payoff is high to soil conservation
and fertilizer1 manure application. Hence, programs
and policies that reduce the cost and increase the use
of these investments and inputs will have great returns to land productivity in a country where each
hectare will count in the struggle for food security.
