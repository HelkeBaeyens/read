Infrastructure and rural development: insights from a Grameen
Bank village phone initiative in Bangladesh*
Abdul Bayes*
Jahangirnagar University, Savm; Dhaka, Bangladesh

Abstract
The intention of the present paper is to evaluate the role of telecommunications within the contexts of rural development in
general and of poverty reduction in particular. Bangladesh has been selected as a case study due to the uniqueness it displayed
in an innovative program for expanded telecom infrastructure, in which Grameen Bank (GB) of Bangladesh, the village-based
micro-finance organisation, leased cellular mobile phones to successful members. GB calls these phones village pay phones
(VPPs). The effects ofVPPs are assessed from two angles: sellers of services (telephone lessees/owners) and buyers of services
(villagers). The findings of the study lead to two basic conclusions: first, pursuance of pragmatic policies can turn telephones
into production goods, especially through lowering transaction costs, and second, the services originating from telephones in
villages are likely to deliver (even) more benefits to the poor than to the non-poor. The VPPs also seem to have perceptible and
positive effects on the empowerment and social status of phone-leasing women and their households. For villagers in general,
phones offer additional non-economic benefits such as improved law enforcement, more rapid and effective communications
during disasters, stronger kinship bonding, etc. GB's style of managing communications can help significantly to expand
access to this vital information input for all segments of the population, reduce inequality and thus enhance the broad-based,
pro-poor orientation of rural development activities.© 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
In Bangladesh, as in many other countries of the
developing world, the role of telecommunications
in economic development does not seem to be duly
appreciated. The telecom sector has received scant
attention from policy makers, and the country has witnessed slow expansion of its network over the years.
The country's present infrastructure is considered
to be inadequate in scope, technology and the quality of services. A report produced jointly by World
Bank and Bangladesh Center for Advanced Studies
(BCAS) presented the limitations of telecom services in Bangladesh (World Bank and BCAS, 1998,
pp. 55):

• the telephone density of 0.39 lines per 100 people
is one of the world's lowest (India: 1.0, Nepal: 0.5,
Pakistan: 2.1, Sri Lanka: 1.0, Thailand: 2.5);
• the waiting time for a connection is more than 10
years and the installation charge of US$ 450 for a
new line is one of the highest in the world (e.g.
Pakistan US$ 90, India US$ 60);
• the charge for calling the UK, US$ 1.50/min, is
about six times higher than the charge for calling
Bangladesh from the UK;
• on average, only 2 of 10 calls are successfully completed; the complaint rate averages 50 complaints
per 100 lines per year, clearly indicating the poor
quality of services.
By and large, the present underdevelopment and
poverty of Bangladesh - a country with a per capita
income of US$ 300 and half of its population living below the poverty line - is related to the underdevelopment of basic infrastructure, both physical and human.
The vast majority of rural areas remain largely inaccessible and are consequently unable to take advantage
of opportunities conducive to growth and development
by, for example, the diffusion of modern technology,
extension services, and rapid and effective measures
for dealing with disasters such as floods. A number
of studies have established a causal link between deficient infrastructure and the slow rate of development
in rural areas of Bangladesh (e.g. Ahmed and Hossain,
1984, pp.l21; Kessides, 1993, pp. 14-23).
Given this gloomy situation, the Grameen Bank
(GB) of Bangladesh stepped into providing some solutions. The GB introduced cellular mobile phones
in some rural areas - so-called village pay phones
(VPPs) -to be operated under its micro-credit programs. The GB entered into the rural telecom sector
based on the following basic premises. First, asymmetry in the realm of information is one of the principal causes of inequality, backwardness and poverty.
The lack of access to information is a powerful factor
tending to perpetuate poverty in rural areas. Second,
telephone services can have a perceptible influence on
production, marketing and other important economic
decisions confronting rural households. Third, technology per se cannot be the solution to the problems of
rural development and poverty reduction unless the issue of 'who controls the technology' can be resolved.
Fourth, even if specific individuals are unable to buy

a phone, they should have access to phone service as
and when they need it.
The following are the objectives of this paper:
• To ascertain how and to what extent VPPs can
promote the socio-economic uplift of villagers, especially of the poor, by affecting socio-economic
parameters which tend to constrain households.
• To evaluate the economic effects of cellular mobile
phones at the household and village levels: at the
household level, by estimating the net increase in
income derived from selling phone services and
determining how this increase affects household
poverty and food consumption; at village levels, by
estimating the consumer surplus (CS), marketing
margins, changes in productivity levels (based on
case studies).
• To assess specific social impacts. These include
changes in the social equilibrium, empowerment of
the disadvantaged, kinship networks and the law
and order situation in the villages.
• To make suggestions regarding the design and
formulation of public policies which are intended
to ensure broader and better access to telecom
services among the poor.
The paper is organised as follows: Section 2 outlines
the data sources employed. Basic information on rural
phone users are provided in Section 3, while the effects
of phones are discussed in Section 4. Finally, policy
conclusions are drawn in Section 5.

2. Research approach and data sources
To determine how VPPs affect rural development
and poverty reduction, both owners (sellers of services) and users (buyers of services) were surveyed.
The sample of phone owners consisted of 50 persons in 50 different villages located at distances of
40-50 km from metropolitan Dhaka. This sample
constituted about 60% of all VPP owners at the time
of the survey. 1 The owners were selected at random
from a list provided by the GB Head Office, Dhaka.
The sample of users of VPP services consisted of 400
individuals. This sample was drawn at random from
1 By early 2001, 700-800 village pay phones were operating in
Bangladesh.

lists provided by the phone owners, and accounts
for 27% of all VPP users in the villages (excluding
owner-users).
This study uses both primary and secondary data.
The primary data were collected through a field survey
conducted in the months of June through August 1998.
Structured questionnaires were administered at both
the household and village levels. Focus-group discussions were held, and GB branch managers and local
people were requested to provide additional input regarding their impressions of the potential and actual
effects of VPPs. Furthermore, case studies of these effects were developed, which required intensive analysis. For its secondary data, the study relies on various
published and unpublished documents from the government of Bangladesh and GB.

phone calls (Table 2). The combined groups of
the poor made 268 calls and, thus, accounted for
one-fourth of all phone calls. On the other hand, the
non-poor made 792 calls, which constituted about
three-fourths of the total. Within the owner/user
group, the share of calls made by the poor and
the non-poor appear to be more or less evenly distributed (45 versus 55%), while among the villagers,
most phone calls were found to have been made by
non-poor households (roughly 78% ). It is noteworthy
that the intensity of use by the poor is 50% greater
than by the non-poor.

The economic status of phone users is shown in
Table 1. Using the FAO's definition of 'poor', as discussed at length in the original research report (Bayes
et al., 1999), 15% of the phone users in the sample
could be categorised as poor (extremely poor 5%, and
moderately poor about 10% ). The majmity of the users
-over four-fifths- fell into the non-poor group. Of
the owner/users group, 14% were moderately poor and
86% were categorised as non-poor. Of the villagers,
6, 9 and about 85% fell into the extremely poor, moderately poor and non-poor groups, respectively.

were women and 40% men. Among the villagers, however, 30% of users were women and 70% men. For
the sample as a whole, 65% of all calls are reported to
have been made by men, and 35% by women. Thus,
it appears that VPPs provide rural women with the
opportunity to use this modern communications technology.
3.4. Mode of payment

On the institutional side, Grameen Tele Communication (GTC) is the service provider buying airtime in
bulk from Grameen Phone Limited (GPL), the network
operator. The GTC provides cellular mobile phones to
GB members under a leasing arrangement. The price
of a phone is provided by the GB, and members have
to repay this sum through weekly instalments within
the stipulated period of 2 or 3 years. The telephone
costs 18,000 Tk., but with the interest that accrues, the
sum to be repaid within 2 or 3 years totals 23,050 Tk.
(1 US$= 40 Tk.). The weekly instalment ranges from
220 to 160 Tk., depending on whether the repayment
period is 2 or 3 years. It was found that 45% of VPPs
were operated by the owners themselves, while 50%
were operated by the owner's husband, son or daughter, and the remaining 5% were operated by other persons.
3.5. Importance of phone calls

A breakdown of the phone calls according to their
respective levels of importance is presented in Table 4.

It appears that 85% of the phone calls made by the

sample users are 'important' calls. 'Less important'
calls constitute about 12% and 'could be avoided' calls
3%. The last two types of calls are usually made by the
moderately poor and non-poor groups. The extremely
poor group seems to make no unnecessary calls, even
though their share of 'less important calls' remains
more or less the same as that of other groups.
3.6. Purposes of phone calls

Keeping in mind the problems of overlap, we have
categorised the calls into several groups: Economic;
Health (emergency and advice); Social/Personal
(family- and office-related); Remittances; and other
(Table 5). The poor and non-poor groups accounted for more or less the same proportion of
economic/finance-related calls (45.9 and 46.9%, respectively). Within the composite poor group, however, the extremely poor seem to use phones chiefly

for economic purposes, making 33.9% of all their
calls with these purposes in mind. The poor group also
makes relatively more phone calls for health-related
purposes than the non-poor group (17.8 and 10.3%,
respectively).
The non-poor group, on the other hand, makes relatively more phone calls for family/personal considerations (35 versus 32% ), remittances (4 versus 1%) and
business-related purposes (25 versus 12%). That the
non-poor devote more of their calls to business-related
purposes is not surprising, given the fact that most of
the business activities in rural areas are carried out
by persons falling into the non-poor group. However,
even the extremely poor group indicates that about
21% of their calls are made for business-related purposes. This goes to show that even the poorest, who
are involved in petty production of eggs, vegetables,
puffed rice, poultry rearing, etc. make phone calls in
order to keep informed about the business environment. The lion's share of the phone calls made by the
poor group deal with economic and health considerations.

4. The effects of village pay phones
4.1. Economic effects
4.1.1. Net profit ofVPP owners
As was explained above, the GB leased phones to
its most successful members in the target villages.
The objective was to supplement household income,
rather than replace it (at least over the short term).
As is the case with other business activities, the net
profit achieved on telephone services equals total receipts/revenues from sales minus total costs incun·ed
to realise these sales. To calculate the net profit earned
from selling phone services, the following formula was
used:

+ a2 X TMni + a3

where NPi is the net profit (Tk. per week) on phone

(2.4 Tk./min), TMni the total minutes of NWD calls
per week, a2 the returns on NWD calls (5 Tk./min),

TMii the total minutes of ISD calls per week, a3 the
returns on ISD calls (7 Tk./min), Twi the total tips

the phone (Tk. per week), OC; the opportunity costs
of the operator's time (Tk. per week), and Oi is the
other costs, e.g. line rent (Tk. per week).
Statistics on net profits are presented in Table 6.
The VPP owners earn an average net profit of 277 Tk.
per week. The profit level ranges from as high as 683
Tk. per week to as low as -35 Tk. per week. The
profits accruing from phone services constitute from
about one-fifth to one-fourth of the total income of the
sample households. Half of the sample owners reap a
net profit of >300 Tk. per week, and one-tenth earn
>500 Tk. per week. However, the net profits of 16%
of the sample phone owners fell < 100 Tk. per week.

4.1.2. Alternative means of communication
Respondents were also asked the following question: "how would you satisfy the need for current calls
had there been no VPP in your village?" the responses
made by three different income groups are presented
in Table 7. The most frequently mentioned alternative
is that one would either go, or hire a person to go
to the place concerned. The range of options across
income groups is worth mentioning. Among the extremely poor group, 68% would have required physical mobility (involving time and transport). In the
moderately poor and non-poor groups, the corresponding figures were 56 and 47%, respectively. In other
words, if no VPPs had been available, the poor would
have required greater additional physical mobility than
the non-poor. Just the opposite, however, is the case
when other sources of telephone service are used. The
non-poor would have used relatively more of that service than the poor. By and large, it seems that the

absence of VPPs would inflict relatively higher transaction costs for communications on the poor.
4.1.3. Consumer surplus
An estimate of the CS yielded by VPPs is presented
in Table 8. The CS is defined as the difference between the price consumers actually pay and the price
they would be willing to pay for a particular communication. For the purposes of the present study, CS is
defined as the price users would have paid for an alternative mode of communication, minus the price they
actually paid for the phone service. Thus, the surplus
estimated could also be considered as the consumer's
real income benefits arising out of being able to make
a phone call. The calculation of the CS is based on the
following assumptions:
• Time and road-transport costs are included for the
potential or possible alternative means of communication. For example, we asked the respondents how
much they would have to pay in time and transport

costs if their only communication alternative was
road transport.
• The opportunity costs of the time spent were calculated on the basis of prevailing rural wage rates.
A uniform wage rate was used for both the poor
and the non-poor groups as the non-poor group may
have the choice of employing wage labour to acquire information at the poor group's wage rate,
rather than at their own higher reservation wage.
• The actual cost to phone users amounted to the price
they paid at the time of receiving the services.
From the data in Table 8, it can be seen that the
availability of VPPs provides average users in all income strata with a fair amount of CS. For example,
while the cost of alternate communication is 71.58
Tk., using VPP's costs only 16.82 Tk., yielding a surplus of 54.77 Tk. per call or 165 Tk. per user per week
(assuming three phone calls a week). This compares
with household income of 1500 Tk. per week. In
other words, the surplus so created amounted to 11%
of the household income of families with telephone
users. The most important observation to be made in
Table 8 is, however, that the CS of the poor, at 77.86
Tk., is 50% higher than that of the non-poor. This
amount of CS, if converted at present rural prices,
could purchase 12 kg of coarse rice. Furthermore, the
moderately poor gain a CS of 91.64 Tk., followed
by the extremely poor (61.30 Tk.). The non-poor
(50.78 Tk.) extract the lowest amount of CS. That
the poor would reap the maximum CS following the
advent of VPPs is apparent. The poor usually do not
have much in the way of alternatives to communicate with the outside world, neither relatives to help
with a phone call, nor relatives to provide a ride to
the destination. For the poor, the advent of VPPs

opened up a lower-cost alternative for exchanging
information.
4.1.4. Prices ofproducts and input supplies
One of the important effects of VPPs may be
that they help avert sharp swings in demand, supply
and the prices of commodities. The proponents of
VPPs hypothesise that the dissemination of market
information to remote villages would help raise farm
output prices and lower farm input prices through
the mechanism of information diffusion. Admittedly,
differences that could be discerned (either moderating prices or smoothing supply) might be attributable
not only to telephones, but to a variety of other
factors such as roads, mass media, etc. The related
'perceptions' of the local people regarding the utility
of the services were considered to be of value for this
research. Similarly, attempts were made to determine
what views were held in control villages. A summary of the economic and non-economic benefits, as
perceived by the villagers, is presented in Table 9.
The average prices of agricultural commodities (especially of paddy and eggs) were higher in target villages (with phones) than in control villages (without
phones).

For example, farmers in the target villages received
70-75% of the paddy prices paid by final consumers,
as opposed to 65-70% in control villages. The argument that market efficiency is improved is highlighted
by one example in particular: the price of eggs in target villages was reported to be 13 Tk. per bali during the period of the survey, compared to 12 Tk. per
bali in control villages. Likewise, vegetable growers
in a target village informed us that VPPs helped them
by providing them with easy and instant access to the
prevailing market demand and supply situation and,
thus, aided them in making appropriate production decisions. Besides, they argued, VPPs have reduced the
role of middlemen who often used to deceive them in
the absence of market information.
The supply of agricultural inputs such as diesel and
fertiliser is reported to be smoother and more stable
in target villages than in control villages. According
to dealers who do business with these inputs, VPPs
have made it possible to develop an impression of the
supply situation throughout the year, making it possible to guard against unforeseen contingencies. On
the other hand, the lack of such communication facilities in control villages has been reported to promote occasional shortages and price hikes, adding to

producers' cash burden at the margin. Another example involves market transparency regarding the rate of
exchange between Taka and Saudi Ryal at the village
level. The VPPs are also reported to have increased
the productivity, capacity utilisation and profitability
of small livestock and poultry enterprises by (a) facilitating the regular and easy delivery of inputs at lower
cost, (b) disseminating market prices for produce and,
thus, helping to ensure payment of a fair price and (c)
reducing the scope of the risks associated with such
business.

4.2. Poverty and food situation effects
The phone-owning households were asked questions such as: "in how many months of the year were
your household members able to eat well before you
entered the phone business, and in how many months
of the year can they eat well now?" the difference
between the number of months 'before' and the number of months 'after' was taken as a proxy variable
for the change in food consumption. Since the inquiry involved the situations before and after the
households had entered the phone services business,
interpretation of the responses hinges on the ceteris
paribus assumption. In order to assess this fully,
however, further research on consumption effects is
needed.
Table 10 indicates that none of the households reported any deterioration in the situation during the
relevant periods, although 14% reported the same
situation as before. One-fourth of the respondents

reported that their food situation had improved by
3 months (i.e. these households reported that they
can now 'eat well' in three more months than they
could earlier), and one-fifth of the households responded that their food situation had improved
by >3 months. In all, 86% of the phone-owning
households reported that their food situation had
improved.

4.2.1. Dealing with disasters
One major benefit of VPPs was seen in JulySeptember 1998, when Bangladesh was hit by the
worst flood in modern history and two-thirds of the
country's area remained submerged for >2 months.
People and transport began to get stuck en route.
When people got stuck in or near target villages,
mobile phones proved to be invaluable for sending
messages to worried relatives or informing employers
or calling relief agencies. During field visits that took
place after the floodwater receded, it was learned
that bills for VPPs rose during the flood months to
substantially higher averages than in earlier months
due to the increased demand for phone services. GB
officials confirmed this phenomena. On the other
hand, local government officials informed us that the
availability of VPPs enabled them to take stock of the
situation quickly during the flood.
4.3. Socio-cultural effects
4.3.1. Law and order situation
In a few of the sample villages, it was reported that
the law and order situation had improved as a result of
the availability of VPPs. In the event of any burglary
or theft, villagers in target villages were able to inform law-enforcement agencies rapidly by phone. In
addition, law enforcement agencies in the vicinity also
reported that fast communication with target villages
contributed to decreasing crimes rates.
4.3.2. Overseas communication
In almost all villages, a fairly large number of people are reported to be working abroad. Many of them
belong to poor families who sold land and other assets to pay for their travel. The inhabitants of target
villages informed us that communication with the outside world had become very fast and regular following
the arrival of VPPs in villages.

4.3.3. Health
It was pointed out earlier that roughly one-tenth of
all calls deal with health-related matters, especially
among poor people. As a result of the availability of
VPPs, villagers can now contact clinics, doctors or ambulances rapidly, even at night. This was not possible
in the past. During discussions with focus groups and
interactions with the local elite and social workers, it
was revealed that the greatest benefit brought about
by VPPs was the capability to call doctors and clinics
rapidly. In a country where the infant mortality rate is
91 per 1000 live births and the maternal mortality rate
is also very high, VPPs' contribution to saving lives
can hardly be exaggerated.
4.3.4. Empowerment of women
Various studies in the context of micro-credit programs in Bangladesh argue that there have been
substantial positive developments in the empowerment of women (e.g. Amin et al., 1998, pp. 36).
Findings regarding empowerment are presented in
Table 11. It may be observed that sample households'
decision-making processes are dominated by joint
decisions made by both the husband and the wife.
That is, whenever household-level decisions have to
be made in regard to family affairs, the utilisation of
GB credit, or the spending of phone income, both
members of the pair participate. For example, 72% of
the respondents replied that the decisions on family
affairs (e.g. schooling for children, the marriage of
daughters or sons, etc.) are made by both partners
on the basis of mutual consultation. The percentage
is 60% when the utilisation of GB credit is at issue.
When the issue involved is the spending of earnings
from telephone services, however, 58% of the owners
make joint decisions, while 36% decide entirely on
their own. In other words, sample women appear to
have greater latitude in deciding how to spend phone

269

income than is the case when the other two issues are
involved. For example, 36% of the respondents decide
entirely on their own where and how to spend phone
profits, compared to 16 and 30% for the other two
cases, respectively. Chi-square test results indicate
that these differences are statistically significant.
Another indicator of empowerment is the degree of
mobility of women in and around the village. Traditionally, Bangladeshi women are 'locked in' the house
and rarely have the right to move freely around the
village. Of course, the role of GB and other NGOs has
broken this shackle to some extent by giving women
opportunities to come out of the household and become involved in income-generating activities. However, most of those activities have been confined to the
premises where they live (kitchen gardening, poultry
rearing, sewing, etc.). Ownership of a mobile phone
seems to have opened a new dimension in this respect. The team of researchers was able to observe
that the mobile phones gave their owners greater mobility within the village than they had before. This is
because incoming calls for villagers make it necessary
to take the phone to them, and if no family members
are found to be available, the women themselves have
to rush about with the mobile phone. This job they
have to perform even during the night. Since many of
the phones are placed in their shops in a nearby hat
or bazaar (small market), owners were found to go
to the phone whenever needed. Thus, mobile phones
appear to have enhanced women's mobility not only
within the village, but also outside it.
Two additional aspects of the mobility issue should
be mentioned. First, women in the village come to
the owner's house to make phone calls, and second,
sample women reported that the mobile phones expanded the scope of their mobility even beyond the
local markets. For example, whenever they decided to
visit relatives far away from their villages, they could

contact their families by phone and inform them of
their time of arrival, which reduces family tensions and
conflicts.

4.3.5. Changes in social equilibrium and status
Many phone-owning households did not appear to
be poor households at the time of the survey. On
the contrary, they appeared to be relatively well-off
within the context of their economic conditions: moderately furnished houses, some TV sets, sanitary latrines, tube-wells, etc. Between 5 and 10 years ago,
however, many of these households were below the
poverty line, and GB micro-credit programs helped
them to gradually escape from grinding poverty. However, for their economic uplift, the women had to depend on the help of a number of their village's wealthy
elite. Now, however, they are reported to be standing on their own feet. Interestingly, some of the people who came to their premises to make phone calls
were the relatively wealthy villagers who had earlier helped them with food, clothing and shelter. Reportedly, patron-client relationships grew up between
some of them. For example, about one-fourth of the
phone owners reported that the people who depend
on them for phone calls include some persons who
once lent them money to help them overcome economic hardships. Similarly, 12% of the phone owners reported that some phone users had once hired
them as maidservants. And 34% reported that they
were helped in various ways by many of the users
(Table 12).
The women in control of cellular mobile phones are
proud of their present business. According to them,
it has not only helped them earn additional income,
but ownership has also conferred on them a certain
amount of fame. Everyone in their village and in adjacent villages now knows them and identifies their

'bari' (cluster of houses) by the name of the technology they own, e.g. Phone Bari (house of the phone) or
by the name of the owner (e.g. Nurjahan's bari). This
was not the case when the same women used to undertake traditional activities such as poultry rearing, rice
husking or grocery selling. Their social status is further enhanced by the increased income that seems to be
raising their household's standard of living. Villagers
now respect phone owners. Some of them are also invited to social functions (even to marriage ceremonies
of the village's elite), something which would have
been unthinkable in the context of rural Bangladesh
earlier.
4.3.6. Knowledge and confidence
Discussions with phone owners indicate that phone
ownership provides not only weekly income, but also
knowledge about many things which used to be virtually unknown to sample women. For example, when
business people approach them to make phone calls
to various markets, the women, who stand beside the
caller, get to know the names of the markets and the
commodities in which they generally deal. When villagers receive calls from outside the country, the phone
owners get to know the names of the places from
which the calls originate. Sometimes owners are told
about the currency or the socio-economic conditions
in that particular country. Thus, each day, owners get
to know new things and expand the frontier of their
knowledge. Mobile phone ownership has given these
women confidence. The fact that they are reaping the
rewards of their good records of repayment and the
fulfilment of other criteria required by GB contributes
to this confidence. Once they assumed that they would
have to sell eggs, puffed rice or cow milk throughout their lives in order to eke out a living. They could
hardly have dreamt that they would now own a modern
communication technology such as a cellular mobile
phone.
4.3. 7. Strengthening kinship networks
Another important effect of VPPs can be seen in
the strengthening of kinship networks. The advent of
VPPs has enabled villagers to stay in touch with relatives living outside the village. In typical Bangladeshi
society, collecting news about immediate family members and other relations in far places is a perennial
concern. In the past, it was not possible to main-

A. Bayes I Agricultural Economics 25 (2001) 261-272

tain a level of kinship interaction comparable to that
which VPPs now allow at such low transaction costs.
In the absence of VPPs, efforts to maintain kinship
networks were not only expensive, but also relatively
ineffective.

5. Conclusions and policy implications
The availability of village pay phones results in
substantial socio-cultural benefits in rural areas. For
example, the ownership of the phones by relatively
poor households tends to raise their social status and
pave the way for change in the social equilibrium.
Mobile phones make women more mobile both within
and outside their villages. In addition, increased
income from phones also raises their exchange entitlements in the market and, thus, helps to reduce
their poverty. Villages with phones also report that
they are very useful in coping with natural calamities and improving law-enforcement. Given these
multi-dimensional benefits of village phones, the study
arrives at the following general conclusions and policy
implications.
5.1. Parting with old perceptions
Telephones should be treated not only as a consumer good, but also as a production good, especially
in poor rural areas. There, telephones are not a domain reserved for relatively wealthy, as has been
thought by some, but a market in which lower income
groups also have substantial stakes once they gain
access. These findings call for a rapid re-orientation
in the thinking of policy-makers. The development of
telecom services in rural areas appears to be a factor
powerfully promoting and supporting the objectives
of rural development and poverty reduction. Further
research on the role of communications technology
is needed to increase our understanding of these
links.
5.2. Deregulation and opportunities for
the private sector

271

of VPPs in Bangladesh is a by-product of policies
designed to bring about gradual deregulation, liberalisation and privatisation, which the government has
been pursuing in the telecom sector for a number of
years. Progress in this direction should be accelerated. Allowing the private sector to play a competitive
role in the telecom business would reduce the cost of
calls and increase the efficiency of the system. The
BTTB should be prepared to accept the presence and
activities of the private sector. The government can
retain ownership of fixed lines while vesting the private sector with cellular phones. Investment must be
stimulated in the sector. Quite obviously, capacity is
seriously limited. A public-private partnership may
be required in order to realise the investments needed,
with a view to reducing international traffic jams and
increasing interconnections.
5.3. Communications technology for the poor
The GB's style of managing mobile phones in
villages can enhance the technology's broad-based,
pro-poor orientation. In Bangladesh, the relatively
wealthy sections of villages have traditionally
owned, managed and led the introduction of modern
technologies (e.g. irrigation). Such patterns of ownership have allegedly resulted in inequitable distributions of income and wealth. The fact that relatively
poor people can also own and access modern information technology may go a long way towards
reducing poverty and restoring a more equitable
distribution.
The strong institutional capacities of poor peoples'
organisations, such as micro-finance associations, can
facilitate efforts to make the poor the managers of
new technologies. This may be considered an additional pay-off on earlier investments in the formation
of such rural organisations. Many such organisations
in other parts of the developing world could also function as hosts for telecommunications services and thus
rapidly broaden access by the poor. In this context,
too, development policy, and not just the market, has
an important part to play.
