Abstract
Factors affecting the cost to the farmer of employing soil erosion reduction strategies are examined for the steep
hillsides near Tegucigalpa, Honduras. Linear programming and MOTAD are used to examine these factors. Results
indicate that some modest reductions in erosion can be achieved at little cost to the farmer by reorganizing
production, switching .rotations, and using contour plowing. These modest reductions still lead to extremely high
rates of erosion. Sharper reductions may be achieved at progressively higher costs as erosion control structures are
constructed and acreage is left fallow. There is a high cost to the farmer of reducing erosion to 'sustainable' levels. A
consistent tradeoff emerges between levels of soil conservation, income, and risk; erosion reduction efforts lead to
lower incomes and higher risk. The analysis of likely benefits to farmers for erosion reduction shows that even under
assumptions of very high yield losses from soil erosion, optimal farm plans still lead to high rates of soil loss, implying
a need for policies that internalize externalities if off-farm damages are to be minimized.

1. Introduction

Major increases in agricultural production have
been realized in developing countries over the
last half century. However, those increases have
been erratic over time, uneven among countries
and regions, and concerns are increasingly expressed that production growth may not be sustainable under current agricultural practices. One
of the primary sustainability concerns is that soils
are eroding at a rapid rate leading to declines in

potential agricultural productivity. Soil erosion
also leads to off-farm impacts such as siltation of
rivers resulting in flooding, reduced water quality,
and diminished reservoir capacity. In many countries, poverty and population pressures have led
to increased cultivation of steep fragile lands. In
other countries, pricing policies have created incentives for intensive cultivation in areas previously farmed extensively. Traditional practices,
which may have been sustainable under lower
population pressures and extensive farming conditions, are highly erosive under intensive farming of marginal lands.
The long-run solutions to soil erosion problems depend on reduced population growth, in-

creased non-farm employment opportunities,
more equitable distribution of land in certain
countries, and policies that discourage farming on
highly erosive lands. In the short run, however,
incentives can be created to encourage the use of
soil conservation practices on these lands. Farmer
decisions to employ soil conserving measures are
influenced by net returns, attitudes toward risk,
planning horizons and discount rates, available
technology, and education, among other factors
(Anderson and Thampapillai, 1990). These factors, in turn, can be influenced by government
policies that affect prices, access to credit, land
titling, and education.
The importance of these factors has been the
subject of a significant amount of empirical analysis in developed countries since the 1950s. Boggess
et al. (1979), Walker and Timmons (1980) and
White and Partenheimer (1980), each found that
soil conservation methods reduced net farm income in the short run in the United States.
Kramer et al. (1983) found that risk aversion
implied crop mixes with greater levels of per acre
soil loss in Virginia. Again in the United States,
Seitz et al. (1979), Erwin and Washburn (1981)
and Walker (1982) found that farmers will not
use erosion control practices to maintain productivity of their land unless they have very low
discount rates and long planning horizons. Soil
erosion can take many years to have a significant
effect on agricultural productivity. Unfortunately,
in marginal areas of developing countries, planning horizons are likely to be short and the rate
of discount high because farmers operate at barely
a subsistence level. They are likely to place substantially higher value on the use of soil resources
today than in the future.
Fortunately, many technical solutions exist for
controlling soil erosion not only in developed but
also in developing countries. Terraces, contour
cultivation, reduced tillage, live barriers, hill-side
ditches, and modified crop rotations are just a
few of the field-level practices employed. Most of
these practices are quite practical even in low
income countries, and have been promoted by
extension services there for many years. Because
these practices often require investments, access
to credit may be important to the adoption deci-

sian (Blase, 1960; Van Vuuren, 1986). Binswanger (1980) found that in rural India, farmers'
investment in land improvements is affected by
ability to obtain credit. Output and input pricing
policies can also influence decisions to adopt
conservation practices. Fertilizer subsidies may
cause farmers to ignore soil conservation practices in the belief that fertilizers will maintain
agricultural productivity despite losses in topsoil
(Walker and Young, 1986). Price policies, including exchange rate policies, that often discriminate
against agriculture in developing countries may
reduce incentives to invest in land-conserving activities by reducing the value of farmland (Repetto, 1989). Policies that distort individual output
prices may either encourage or reduce soil erosion depending on the degree of erosivity of
particular crops. Land titling can influence soil
erosion as secure land tenure may be needed for
farmers to invest in soil conservation practices.
Feder and Onchan (1987) found this to be the
case in Thailand, although Lee (1980) found little
correlation between tenure security and soil erosion in the United States.
Relatively little empirical analysis of farm-level
economic incentives for soil conservation has been
conducted in developing countries. Barbier (1990)
summarized evidence from several sources on the
factors influencing adoption of soil conservation
in the uplands of Java. Veloz et al. (1985) estimated net returns and social benefits from erosion control in a watershed in the Dominican
Republic. But empirical analysis of incentives for
alternative practices has been sparse, in part because of the difficulty in calculating soil losses
associated with the practices. Also, no empirical
studies in developing countries have incorporated
risk analysis in their economic evaluations of soil
conservation practices. The purpose of the current paper is to present the results of a case study
of the on-site costs and benefits of alternative soil
conservation practices in Honduras. 1

1 Off-site effects of erosion are not discussed in this paper,
not because they are unimportant, but in order to focus on
economic factors influencing farmers decisions concerning soil
conservation.

Problems of soil erosion are reported to be
critical in the central and southern regions of the
country (Tracy, 1988). Estimates of soil loss per
ha exceed 300 tons per year on steep slopes
under traditional agricultural practices. Uncertainty about land tenure characterizes virtually
the entire country. Honduran farmers also face
uncertainty about economic returns. Information
is needed on the risk associated with those practices as previous studies suggest that farmers are
likely to be risk averse (Just, 1974).
Specific objectives of this paper are to: (a)
summarize the results of a study that examined
the most profitable mix of soil conservation practices and crops under several levels of soil loss
and risk; (b) analyze the effects that different
planning horizons have on the profitability of
those practices and hence, indirectly, on the importance of land tenure; and (c) present implications for specific public policies affecting soil
erosion in Honduras. A linear programming
model is used in the empirical analyses.

2. Description of the study area

The study area is located in the Guacerique
Watershed in the central region of Honduras.
This watershed provides 60% of the water consumed in the capital city, Tegucigalpa. Soil erosion is a concern for policy makers due to its
effect on water quality and on the lives of the
major reservoirs for Tegucigalpa.

Approximately 20% of the watershed (180 km 2 )
is dedicated to agriculture while 70% is forested
and 10% is devoted to animal production and to
population centers. The average altitude is 1420
m above sea level and the average annual temperature of 18°C varies by altitude. Average precipitation is 1200 mm per year.
The study area is the most important supplier
of horticultural products for the central and
southern markets of the country, although only
5% of the agricultural area is devoted to vegetable production. Eighty-two percent of the agricultural area is planted to subsistence crops, especially corn and, to a lesser extent, beans. Fields
are generally small, from 0.3 to 1.0 manzanas,
and farms average 1.5 to 2.0 manzanas. 2
Two of the primary problems facing agriculture in the watershed are soil erosion and improper use of pesticides that contaminate the
Guacerique river (Welchez, personal interview,
1991). Concern for both these problems motivated the formation of the USAID-supported
Land Use and Production Enhancement (LUPE)
project in the area. LUPE personnel educate
farmers about sustainable farming practices, and
have conducted extensive inventories of the region.

3. Methods and data

A representative farm model was constructed
for the watershed using field survey data, enterprise budgets, and calculations of soil loss using
the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) with its
coefficients tailored to Honduras. The model was
solved using linear programming, with an objective of maximizing net returns subject to various
levels of soil loss and risk. The model incorporated several soil conservation practices and cultivation methods.
A highly aggregated tableau for the base model
without risk activities and constraints is presented
in Table 1. The letters A, B and C represent sets
of coefficients. In general, a negative sign on a
coefficient in the tableau indicates that an activity
supplies cash, production, labor, etc., while a
positive sign indicates that a product, input, or
cash is required. The presence of both a positive
and a negative sign on the same coefficient indicates that the coefficient in the tableau represents a set of coefficients on rows and activities
containing poth positive and negative signs.
Major activities included crop production on
three land types, labor hiring, borrowing, selling
crops, construction of soil conservation devices,
cash transfers, and an activity to place a minimum bound on family expenditures. A total of
243 activities were included. Major constraints
included land, labor, crop transfers, rotations,
credit, soil loss, and cash. A total of 197 constraints were incorporated. When a risk component was added to the model, the objective function was to minimize mean absolute deviations
from average income for several levels of net
returns and soil loss. Deviations from mean income from each activity were included in a set of
risk constraints at the bottom of the model following the MOTAD procedure of Hazell and
Norton (1986).
Crops may be grown on land type A (2%
slope), land type B (10% slope), or land type C
(24% slope). There were 181 crop production
activities that resulted from combinations of
crops, planting seasons, land types, soil conservation devices used, and tillage systems. Cropping
activities used land, labor, and capital to produce

crops that were transferred and sold. Land could
also be taken out of production to meet soil loss
restrictions. Borrowing activities were allowed in
each month at the interest rate being charged by
the farmers' cooperative, the primary source of
credit in the area. Borrowing supplied cash in
each month and required payment with interest
in subsequent months. Available family labor was
48 person-months per year.
Monthly cash requirements for productive inputs were calculated for each crop. All such cash
requirements and family expenses were paid from
an initial cash endowment, crop sales, or from
borrowing. Transfers of surplus cash to the subsequent month were made each month. At the end
of the year, cash had to be sufficient to repay
loans and to replace the initial cash endowment. 3
Coefficients on cropping activities in the soil loss
constraint specified the amount of soil loss for
particular crops on each land type in each time
period under different tillage practices and with
different soil conservation devices. The right hand
side of this constraint specified the amount of soil
loss allowed for the farm.
3.1. Farmer survey

Data to generate many of the coefficients for
the representative farm models were obtained by
surveying farmers in the watershed during July
1991. Twelve farmers were chosen at random
from the list of farmers in the region provided by
the LUPE project. In each interview farmers were
asked questions about the make-up of the family,
land tenure, crops and rotations including production costs and output prices, soil conservation
practices, labor use and costs, and credit. The
length and slope of each field were measured,
and the number of manzanas that fall within each

3 The cash constraint began with an endowment of 494
Lempiras (US$1.00 = 5.5 L.). Each month, 386 L. for family
expenses and input expenses that varied by crop, depending
on the budget and agricultural calendar, were subtracted.
Sales of crops added to the cash in the month in which the
sales occurred, and the household was free to borrow for
consumption at the appropriate interest rate.

slope and the crops grown on each degree of
slope were recorded.
The average farm in the survey was found to
have 1.7 manzanas with 35% of the area with an
average slope of 2%, 26% of the area with an
average slope of 10%, and 39% with an average
slope of 24%.
The most important crops in the area are corn,
beans, corn and beans intercropped, cabbage,
onions, and tomatoes. A small amount of coffee
is also produced. Production is continuous from
May through December (the rainy season), and
when irrigation is available it extends through the
summer months of January through April. Sixty
percent of the farmers have irrigation on an average of 24% of the area.
The main means of conserving soil found in
the survey included contour cultivation, live barriers, hill-side ditches, and terraces. The most common tillage system found was conventional, with
minimum and no-till observed on a few farms. All
three tillage systems were included in the linear
programming model for corn, beans, and cornbeans intercropped. Only conventional tillage was
allowed in the model for cabbage, tomatoes,
onions, and coffee.
The average family consisted of four people.
Agricultural activities were performed to a greater
degree by men and children, but women helped
with agricultural activities when needed. A cooperative in the area provided credit at an annual
interest rate of 24% although only three out of
the 12 farmers surveyed used credit.
3.2. Soil loss values

Soil loss values were required for each production activity. These values were incorporated into
a soil loss constraint and specified the amount of
soil loss that would occur under specific management practices, weather, type of soil, slope, and
soil conservation devices. The USLE was used to
calculate soil loss coefficients. Briefly, the USLE
predicts gross soil loss per unit of land as:

A =RKLSCP
where A is the computed soil loss per unit area
per unit of time, R is a rainfall and runoff factor,

261

K is a soil erodability factor, L is a slope length
factor, S is a slope steepness factor, C is a
ground cover and management factor, and P is a
support practice factor. The latter is the ratio of
soil loss with a device like contouring or terracing
to that with straight-row farming up and down
the slope.
Values for each factor were derived for the
study area. The rainfall and runoff factor, R, was
located in a study completed near the study area
(Wouters, 1980). The soil erodability factor was
calculated using information from a soil analysis
in the study area (Recursos Hfdricos, 1983) and
from Wischmeier and Smith (1978). Values for P,
L and S were also obtained from Wischmeier
and Smith except for live barriers. Values for live
barriers were based on interpolated values between contour cultivation and hillside ditches.
The C factor is measured as the ratio of soil loss
from an area with specified cover and management to that with tilled fallow. It was calculated
for each combination of crop and tillage system
following procedures in Wischmeier and Smith.
Crop stages were identified through consultation
with agronomists in the area. Cabbage, onions,
and beans were the most erosive crops.
3.3. Budgets

Crop budgets were constructed and the resulting information on input use, prices, and input
costs was incorporated into the linear programming model. Budgets were based on those published for the Central region of Honduras and
adjusted by information gathered in the farm
level survey and by agronomists in the area. Yields
were varied by slope. Land with 2% slope was
assumed to yield 0.5% more than land with 10%
slope and 3% more than land with 24% slope.
These yield differences reflect only the effect of
slope on the amount of horizontal land area
under production and hence may be considered
to be minimum differences. Other factors such as
lower root depth, and poorer nutrient content are
likely to reduce yields on higher sloped lands by
even more; data for these adjustments do not,
however, exist.
The costs of constructing and maintaining con-

servation devices were calculated based on information in Almendariz (1990), Tracy and Mungia
(1986), Michaelson (1986), and from information
provided by LUPE personnel. These costs, which
were composed entirely of hired labor expenses,
were averaged over a 10-year planning horizon;
the practices were assumed to have a 10-year life.
Thus, one tenth of the total construction labor
and a 10% annual maintenance allowance were
charged for each conservation device in the annual model. Inclusion of conservation devices also
required calculation of their effects on the amount
of land available to cultivate. The amount of land
removed from production by the presence of these
devices (such as grass strips, etc.) on steep slopes
is considerable.

Risk was included in the model by gathering 5
years of average yield data from various sources 4
and crop prices (retail) from a publication of the
Unidad de Planificaci6n Sectorial Agricola (1990).
Thus, both yield and price risk were included in
the measurement of income risk in the model.
A one-year linear programming model that
maximizes net farm income was used to examine
the effects of different soil loss levels on farm
income. The one-year model may be considered
to be an average year when the farmer is in an
equilibrium state. A MOTAD model that mini-

4. Results

Four sets of analyses were completed with the
linear programming model: (a) income-soil loss
tradeoffs, (b) risk-income tradeoffs, (c) consideration of the effects of varying the length of planning horizon, and (d) an analysis of the optimal
level of soil loss given a range of assumptions
about the effect of erosion reduction on average
yields. The result of these analyses are presented
below with interpretation of selected shadow

The effects of different soil loss limits on net
farm income, crops produced, and on conservation devices and tillage systems are presented in
Table 2. With no limit on soil loss, 328 tons of
soil per manzana per year would be lost (this
amount is called the base loss) and a net income
of 5929 L. (this is equivalent to US$1078) would
be earned on the representative farm. More than
a 50% reduction in soil erosion can be achieved
with little effect on income. However, when soil
loss is restricted to 20% or less of the initial base

loss, income drops more sharply. If only 2% of
the quantity of soil loss under no restrictions is
allowed (7 tons per manzana per year), income is
reduced to 2826 L. 5
Bean, cabbage, and onion production under
conventional tillage and contour cultivation lead
to the highest income and greatest soil loss. Borrowing occurs only in May and labor is not hired.
Soil loss restrictions have little effect on the mix
of crops grown until only 20% of the base soil
loss is allowed. At that point, coffee is grown on
the steepest slopes. When only 2% of the base
soil loss is permitted, the steepest slopes are left
uncultivated.
Conventional tillage with contour cultivation
predominates, but as erosion restrictions are
tightened, first live barriers with conventional
tillage and later terraces with conventional tillage
enter the solution. With only 10% of the initial
soil loss allowed, live barriers with minimum
tillage come in, and at 2% soil loss allowed,
terraces combined with minimum and no-till enter the solution. Hillside ditches never enter the
solution because they are roughly as effective as
live barriers in reducing erosion but cost more to
construct. Income levels drop when lower
amounts of soil loss are allowed because of the
cost involved in constructing conservation devices, the shifts in crop mix, and the land removed from production at very restrictive levels
of soil loss.
4.2. Risk-income tradeoffs

The effects of erosion reduction strategies on
the risk-return tradeoff faced by farmers were
analyzed under two scenarios. In the first, risk
was minimized subject to different levels of income with no constraint on the amount of soil
loss. In the second, risk was minimized subject to
the income and erosion levels in Table 2. The
results of the analysis for the unconstrained soil
loss scenario are summarized in Table 3 with

respect to income levels, soil loss, and cropping
activities.
Income and risk are positively related and thus
as risk is reduced, so too is income. Soil loss
declines with income and risk, but of course
higher levels of soil loss are associated with any
particular level of income when soil loss is unconstrained compared to the case when soil loss is
constrained. When risk is minimized, beans and
cabbage enter the solution at every income level
whereas corn and beans-corn intercropped enter
only at lower levels of income and risk (compare
Tables 2 and 3). Onions enter only at higher
levels of income and risk. Under this scenario
with no soil loss restrictions, erosion control devices are not constructed. Hence, all changes in
soil loss are due to differences in cropping activities.
Expected income and variance (EV) frontiers
were constructed for (a) the scenario in which
risk was minimized for several levels of income
but soil loss was not restricted and (b) the scenario in which risk was minimized and both income and soil loss were constrained (Fig. 1).
These EV frontiers illustrate that there is substantially more risk encountered when achieving
the constrained level of soil loss. Because most
studies have found farmers to be risk averse, this
implies that mechanisms for reducing price and
yield risk may be needed to provide additional
incentives for soil conservation. Crop insurance

schemes, price stabilization schemes, and research directed at stabilizing crop yields (such as
research on drought and pest resistance) are examples.
4.3. Planning horizons

Different degrees of land tenure security may
cause farmers to differ in their planning horizons.
The model was modified to allow for several
lengths of planning horizons to assess the effects
on use of soil conservation practices. Planning
horizons of 10, 5, 3 years and 1 year were considered. This difference in planning horizon was
modeled by varying the cost of the soil conservation devices. 6 For example, one-tenth of the
construction and life time maintenance costs of
the devices were charged for the 10-horizon.
One-fifth, one-third, and full cost were charged
in subsequent runs of the model.
Modeling of planning horizons in such a fashion maybe justified in two ways. First, since the
costs of construction of devices are mainly labor
costs, labor sharing commonly found the region is
consistent with such a modeling of the planning
horizon. Alternatively, we could argue that we

are mid-way through the planning horizon, and
that a fraction of total maintenance is needed
along with a payback of borrowed funds for labor
hiring during construction. The model does not
include the admittedly lumpy costs of making
such investments, but as we see below, even with
lumpiness, model outcomes are not altered.
The results of these analyses are presented in
Table 4. The outcomes across the different cost
assumptions about planning horizons differ very
little. At high levels of permitted soil loss, few
conservation devices are constructed and therefore there are very small differences in income.
Medium levels of soil loss lead to somewhat larger
income differences. When soil loss is reduced to
very low levels, fallow land enters the solution
with the result that the cost of conservation devices has little effect.
One reason the cost of constructing soil conservation devices is relatively low is the low opportunity cost of labor, the major input in constructing the devices. Because of the low cost, the
effects of spreading the costs over varied planning horizons are minimal. Second, much erosion
reduction comes from adjusting cropping patterns. These costs are independent of the length
of planning horizon.
4.4. Yield changes

6

We assume that the devices are completely constructed in
the representative year model. That is, even though costs are
spread over, say, a 10-year horizon, the entire device is
constructed and contributing to erosion control during the
year we examine. The model thus represents an average year,
and not the adoption of conservation structures.

Unfortunately, no information is available on
the long-term effects of soil erosion on yields.
Yields probably fall over time due to reduced
fertility following soil erosion. The above results

show that unless this soil productivity effect is
significant, the length of planning horizon will
have little influence on the decision to adopt soil
conservation practices. Because farmers in Honduras are likely to discount future benefits significantly due to the severity of current needs and
because they have little knowledge of future productivity effects of erosion, the influence of security of land tenure on soil conservation decisions
is small.
Estimates of the optimal private level of soil
erosion under different assumptions about the
relationship between levels of erosion and yield
changes were obtained in order to shed light on
the need for government interventions to promote erosion reduction 7 . For each model activity, the percentage deviation from a recommended soil loss tolerance 8 was calculated. Activities with annual erosion rates above the tolerance were assumed to experience a yield decline,
while those with lower rates were assumed to
increase yields over time. The yield effects were
calibrated for all activities by assuming a yield
decline of a certain percentage for the most erosive activity, conventional tilled cabbage on the
24% sloped land. Yields for this activity were
assumed to fall by 100%, 90%, 50% and 30%
over the 10-period (Z* in Fig. 2). A straight line

7 A dynamic optimization model is the preferred approach
to examining the tradeoffs between benefits and costs over a
period of time. The average single-year approach is a fair
approximation when the relationship between soil loss and
yields is linear.
8 The recommended loss tolerance used was 5 tons per
acre, or 8.68 tons per manzana. There are no recommended
tolerances for Honduras, so we used the U.S. SCS guidelines
of 5 tons per acre.

Results show that even if 10-average yields are
very responsive to soil erosion, relatively high
levels of erosion are consistent with income-maximizing behavior. When the most erosive activity

is assumed to lose 100% of its yield over a 10period, income falls to 4472 L. per year and
'optimal' erosion is 80.8 tons per manzana. If
yields are less responsive to erosion levels, income falls by less and erosion increases. When
yields for the most erosive activity fall by only
30% over the 10-period, income averages 5229 L.
per year, with an annual erosion level of 219.1
tons per manzana.
When erosion rates affect yields, a consistent
pattern emerges. Soil conservation devices are
constructed on the less steeply-sloped land (first
live barriers and, as yields become more responsive, terraces), while rotation changes occur on
the less steeply-sloped land. As yield declines
caused by erosion become progressively larger,
the 24% sloped land is gradually taken out of
production. The high rates of erosion that occur
on the steeper slopes mean that production there
is unsustainable over time, though productivity
actually grows (through soil conservation) on the
less steeply-sloped lands.
If information on yield responses were available 9 the results could be used to provide a
measure of optimal soil loss from the farmers'
perspective. Given the high levels of 'optimal
erosion' from this analysis and the high off-farm
costs associated with erosion, it is clear that there

9 No information from Honduras was available. As an example, Burt used a response elasticity of 0.33 in his investigation of soil loss in Washington state.

is a need for government action to promote reduced erosion. If yields are very responsive to
erosion the private decision-maker will reduce
erosion to 80.8 tons per manzana per year, yet
this level is still likely to create significant off-farm
damages, and soil productivity on the steeplysloped lands will fall dramatically over the tenyear period. Incentives need to be provided to
increase the rates of conservation on more
steeply-sloped lands.
4.5. Shadow prices and sensitivity analysis

Shadow prices were calculated for different
levels of soil loss allowed, using the model without the risk component (Table 6). These shadow
prices represent the amount by which the objective function would change if the constraint on
soil loss were changed by one unit. They represent the cost of erosion reductions. The value of
0.47 associated with high levels of erosion means
that the marginal value of an extra ton of soil loss
is 0.47 L. The value associated with changing the
soil loss restriction when only 10% is allowed is
20.98 L. Thus as progressively less erosion is
permitted, the cost of additional reductions increases.
Sensitivity analysis was also performed on several prices and on wages (Table 7). This analysis
is useful for assessing the sensitivity of the optimal solution to changes in policies that might
influence these prices. Vegetable prices were
changed 10% (higher and lower), corn and beans

268

were changed 15%, and coffee was changed
10%. 10 Farm income was more sensitive to
changes in vegetable prices than to changes in
prices of corn, beans, or coffee. Soil conservation
is facilitated as vegetable prices fall because vegetables are generally more erosive than other
crops. Coffee price changes have little effect on
income as relatively little coffee is grown even if
the price rises 10%. Increasing wages by 25% has
only a slight effect on income.
5. Conclusions and implications

This paper has examined the economic incentives for farmers to plant particular crops, use
alternative tillage practices, and construct soil
erosion devices under increasing restrictions on
soil loss allowed and alternative levels of risk.
The results indicate that considerable reductions
in soil. loss can be achieved, primarily through
altering cropping patterns. Substantial reductions
in the very high rates of erosion found can only
be achieved at significant cost to the farmer.
Because of the high off-farm costs associated with
these erosion rates, providing better information
to the farmer will not, in isolation, lead to erosion
rates that are compatible with socially optimal
levels. If erosion is reduced from 328 tons per
manzana per year to 7 tons per year, income
would be lowered from 5929 to 2826 L. However,
more than a 50% reduction in soil loss can be
achieved at relatively little loss of income. Cabbage and onions, the highest-return crops, are
also the most erosive and were always present in
the farm plans regardless of the levels of soil loss
required. The lowest levels of soil erosion were
achieved when some land was removed from production.
Higher income plans were riskier regardless of
the level of soil loss. However, reduced soil loss
was achieved at the cost of higher risk. Hence
risk may be a significant barrier to wider use of
soil erosion practices in the watershed.
10 We examine changes in relative prices only; changes in
the overall price level will have a proportionate impact on
income and, thus, are not examined.

Relatively small differences in income were
found when the cost of constructing soil conservation devices was spread over several years rather
than just one year. This small difference suggests
that insecure tenure may not be a significant
barrier to adoption of these devices. Hence, incentive packages designed to promote construction of these devices may be effective regardless
of tenure status. Because most of the soil erosion
occurred on the more steeply-sloped lands and
because the model never constructed erosion
control devices on the steeply-sloped lands, special attention needs to be devoted to them. Incentives should be provided either to take these
lands out of production (e.g., creation of permanent pasture) or to promote erosion control there.
Government intervention is needed to promote less erosive practices. Even if it is assumed
that yields are very responsive to erosion, high
levels of erosion are optimal from a private decisionmaker's perspective. External costs of such
rates are likely to be excessive, so that action to
internalize the costs is necessary.
The assumption of constant technical coefficients over a 10-planning horizon may be unrealistic. As soil is lost, the production relationships
change over time, and new technologies may also
vary these relationships. Innovations that make it
easier to conserve soil, including better ground
cover, wider root bases, and more quickly-developing plant varieties may benefit these farmers. It
is clear that the cost to the farmer of conserving
is excessive under current technologies, and improved conservation techniques are needed to
achieve the twin goals of conserving soil and
maintaining farm incomes. The innovations described above may also lower yield risk.
Some other policy implications of this study
are that the government may want to provide
incentives to farmers to target steeper slopes for
coffee, intermediate slopes for corn and beans
and flatter areas for vegetables. These incentives
might be in the form of restrictions on particular
cropping practices or price policies. It appears
that live barriers and minimum tillage should be
encouraged by the extension service. Policies to
reduce income risk may also encourage soil conservation. Crop insurance, irrigation projects,

price stabilization schemes, or research to develop more drought- and pest-resistant crop varieties are examples.
