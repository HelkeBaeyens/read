Abstract
Previous studies on the environmental impacts of pesticide use have tended to focus either on measuring damages through
changes in relative risks to various environmental categories or examining the trade-off between pesticide use levels and
abatement costs. This study uses the physical risk assessment approach combined with contingent valuation survey results on
consumers' willingness to reduce pesticide risk. The reduction in external costs associated with the changes in pesticide use
in Ontario agriculture between 1983 and 1998 is US$ 188 per household. The environmental benefits are largely due to the
reduction in the level of high and moderate-risk pesticides. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
The intensive use of pesticides in agriculture has
significantly increased agricultural productivity. The
on-farm benefits of pesticide use are off-set to some
degree by the off-farm costs imposed by these pesticides on the environment. Environmental contamination from pesticides ranges from the disruption of
natural water, air and soil functions, to the alteration
of the ecosystem resulting in detrimental affects on
nutrient cycles, or the toxicity of non-target organisms. Concerns over these environmental impacts
have led to policy efforts ranging from moral suasion

to regulations to economic instruments, all designed
to reduce pesticide use. Sound policy design requires
an assessment of the benefits from a reduction in the
amount of pesticide applied.
Approaches to assessing the economic impacts of
reducing pesticide use, specifically through integrated
pest management, have been reviewed recently by
Swinton and Williams (1998). The environmental impacts of pesticide use are commonly proxied through
variables such as pounds of active ingredient (a.i.)
applied or dollars spent on pesticides. Both measures
assume that environmental damage is directly correlated with the quantity of pesticide used, regardless of
the specific chemical and formulation. Given the costs
of monitoring and measuring the extent of damages,
it is impossible to accurately determine the actual
damages of pesticide use. Instead, damages have been
measured through changes in the relative risks to a
series of environmental and human health categories.

An example is the work by Kovach et al. (1992) who
developed the environmental impact quotient (EIQ)
to determine the risk of pesticides to the environment. The EIQ assigns a number to an a.i. based on
11 characteristics of the ingredient in order to calculate the environmental components of the indices.
Higley and Wintersteen (1992) followed by Mullen
et al. (1997) used eight separate criteria to characterise environmental risk from insecticides, herbicides
and fungicides in calculating their environmentally
adjusted EIQs. Hoag and Hornsby (1992), Teague
et al. (1995), and Crissman et al. (1998) included
site-specific criteria in estimating environmental impacts or risks from pesticides. Hoag and Hornsby
(1992) developed a trade-off frontier for pesticide
costs and a ground water hazard index. The criteria
included pesticide specific and site-specific criteria
that could affect the likelihood of ground water contamination. Teague et al. (1995) compared the EIQ
with site-specific estimates of the environmental fate
of pesticides, in addition to the toxicity and leachability measures in the EIQ. Crissman et al. (1998) also
included site-specific information on soil types and
rainfall in their measure of pesticide leaching risk.
While these studies consider the environmental impacts and farm abatement costs of reducing risks, little
has been done on the economic evaluation of these
impacts.
The purpose of this paper is to identify the value
of environmental benefits associated with changes in
the levels and types of pesticides applied in Ontario
agriculture. The approach is similar to that developed
by Mullen et al. (1997) who extended the physical
risk assessment by incorporating a contingent valuation survey to determine consumers' willingness to
pay (CWP) for reductions in pesticide risk to different
components of the environment. The paper begins by
describing the method for assigning levels of relative
risk to the pesticidal a.i.s for eight environmental categories. The approach for valuing the changes in risk
from pesticide use are then described. The changes
in pesticide risk to the environment from 1983 to
1998 are then outlined for all of Ontario agriculture.
The economic value of changes in risks for the eight
environmental categories are then described by time
period and by risk level. Factors contributing to the
changes and subsequent policy implications are then
discussed.

2. Methods
2.1. Identifying changes in pesticide risk to the
environment
The potential for a pesticide to inflict external damage costs (risk) is measured using an approach developed by Mullen et al. (1997). Rather than assume
the amount applied is an accurate proxy for risk, the
approach recognises that risks vary with pesticides
depending on their toxicity, mobility and persistence.
Mullen et al. (1997) develop a set of criteria for assigning levels of relative risk to pesticidal a.i.s for
eight environmental and human health categories;
ground water, surface water, acute human health,
chronic human health, aquatic species, birds, mammals, and arthropods. Each a.i. was assigned a risk
level of high, moderate, or low for each environmental category. For example, atrazine is categorised as
a high environmental risk to ground water, a medium
risk to surface water, aquatic species, acute and
chronic health, and a low-risk to birds, mammals and
non-target organisms. A list of the risk levels posed by
all the pesticides used in Ontario for each of the eight
categories is available from the authors upon request.
The approach thus permits the measurement of the
change in total kilograms of pesticide within each of
the 24 risk per environmental classes (the three levels
of risk for each of the eight environmental categories).
For example, the 585,208 kg of atrazine a.i. applied to
corn in 1993 were allocated to the appropriate risk per
environmental classes as defined above. The amount
of each pesticide applied was similarly allocated. The
total amounts for all pesticides for each class were
then summed to determine the total high, medium and
low-risk per environmental category per survey year.
This total within a given environmental/risk category
can be expressed as
K

where UseiJ is the amount of a.i. (kg) applied from all
pesticides in environmental category i and risk level
j; Pijk the amount (kg) of pesticide k applied that is a
risk level j to environmental category i, and K is the
total number of pesticides applied. Note that, the total
amount of pesticide applied in a year (total) equals the

sum of the amount of a.i. across the three risk levels
for each environmental category

Once the total level of risk is determined in kilograms of a.i. per risk category for each environmental
category i and each risk level j (Useii ), it is possible
to determine the change in risk from year to year.

important they felt it was to avoid a given level of
risk with each of the eight environmental categories
through a six-point Likert scale ranking (0 = not important at all and 6 = very important). This rating was
completed for each of the three risk levels. The importance of reducing risk for each category was then
used to infer the respondent's WTP for a reduction
in risk j for each environmental category i by taking
the Likert scale rating for that category (importance;)
and dividing it by the sum of the ratings for all
categories

2.2. Valuation of changes in environmental risk

importance;

WTPu =
While the change in risk from pesticide use can be
assessed by comparing the amount of pesticide applied
within each risk level across years, this would not account for the greater benefits attached to a reduction
in high versus low-risk pesticide use. One method to
weight, the changes in use for alternative risk levels
is to assign monetary values to these changes. Since
reducing pesticide risk is not a market commodity,
the value of the changes in environmental risk associated with changes in pesticide use must be estimated
through a non-market valuation technique. The estimates used in this study are based on the results of
a contingent valuation survey administered to a random sample of 3000 households in the United States
by Mullen et al. (1997). The questionnaire began by
asking for the respondent's monthly grocery bill followed by questions on the individual's willingness to
pay to avoid a given level of risk to the environment
and human health through an increase in that grocery
bill. The respondents were asked to reveal their willingness to pay for each of the three risk levels (WTPj,
j = 1-3) rather than their WTP for a reduction in risk
for each of the eight environmental categories with
each risk level (WTPij ). Thus, the obtained WTP j for
WTPij is assumed to be the sum of the WTP to reduce
risk within each environmental category. However, the
three WTP j values were not split equally among the
eight environmental categories since is it is assumed
that reducing pesticide use that is high-risk to humans,
for example, is valued more than a corresponding reduction in pesticide use that is high-risk to arthropods.
The revealed WTP j values were used to infer the
eight WTPij values for that risk level through a ranking that the individuals assigned to the environmental
categories. Respondents were asked to identify how

Vi=l,2, ... ,8

(3)

Thus, if all environmental categories were deemed
equally important, the revealed WTP for a risk level
would be divided equally between the eight categories.
The WTP values obtained by Mullen et al. were adjusted to reflect Ontario conditions by using Ontario
average income values and converting into Canadian
dollars. The resulting estimates are listed in Table 1.
With the WTPij, the value from changes in environmental pesticide risks per individual can then be
assessed using the following equation:

a.i. associated with each risk level j and for each
environmental category I (l- (Useijt!USei}t-d) multiplied by the corresponding value for the individual's
WTPij. Decreases (increases) in usage for any environmental/risk category will reduce (increase) the
environmental risk costs. However, savings can be
generated even if there is no change in total pesticide
use between periods, if there is a relative change in the
level of risks posed by the same amount of a.i. For example, benefits are generated if there is a shift toward
low-risk pesticides and away from high-risk ones,
since the WTP values are higher for high-risk than for
low-risk applications. Similarly, a reduction in the dollar value of environmental risk takes place if the relative changes occur for an environmental category for
which the WTP is high. The approach does not account
for the absolute level of pesticide use so that a proportionate reduction of pesticides when a large amount is
applied is valued the same as when the total amount of
use is small. The approach assumes a linear relationship between the percentage risk reduction and actual
risk eliminated within each category since, WTP values are based on how much individuals would be willing to pay to avoid a risk while the actual changes in
pesticide use result in only a fraction of the risk being
eliminated.

3. Data and results
3.1. Data

The Ontario Ministry of Agriculture Food and Rural Affairs has surveyed growers every five years since
1973 to compile a record of the use of herbicides,
insecticides, and fungicides in Ontario crop production. The survey collects the area of each crop grown
(regardless of whether it was sprayed or not), the
amount of product applied to an area, the number of
times a crop is sprayed, and its PCP number that indicates the strength of the product and the multiple
a.i.s in the case of mixtures. The individual grower
data is then aggregated up to the county and provincial level based on production shares. This publicly
available, aggregated data is used in this study to
compare changes in use patterns and to document
progress made in pesticide and environmental risk
reduction.

3.2. Results
3.2.1. Changes in pesticide risk to the environment
The total amount of pesticides applied in Ontario
has declined approximately 40% from 8.8 million kg
of a.i. in 1983 to 5.2 million kg of a.i. in 1998 (Table 2).
The change in the total amount of pesticide use was
associated largely with a decrease in application rates.
Some of the reduced rate (9%) is indirectly attributable
to a government program called Food Systems 2002.
This program funded research and educational activities into pesticide management with the objective of
reducing pesticide use in the province of Ontario by
50% over a 15-year-period ending in 2002. However,
the decrease in the total amount applied is due largely
to two major changes in production practices related
to pesticides during this period. The first change was
a 20% reduction in the total area of land farmed, and
the second was a shift in cropping patterns from corn
to soybeans. Soybeans generally require less herbicide
than corn and the increased use of a com-soybean rotation reduced the need for insecticide compared with
continuous com.
The amount and share of the annual total amount
applied classified by risk level are given for the eight
environmental categories in Table 2. The majority of
the pesticides applied are not considered high-risk for
any of the environmental groupings. In 1983, high-risk
pesticides represented more than one-quarter of the
total amount applied for only the ground water and
chronic human categories. The total amount and share
of pesticides that are high-risk for these categories
declined over time, particularly in terms of chronic
human effects. However, there has been an increase
in the relative share of total pesticides applied that
represent a high-risk to aquatic species, surface water and acute human categories. The share of the total applied that is high-risk for these groupings is approximately 20%. This increase in the relative share
of high-risk pesticides for these three environmental categories came as a result of a decrease in the
amount of moderate-risk pesticides applied. For all
categories, with the exception of arthropods, the total
amount of pesticides that are moderate-risk has fallen
significantly in both absolute amounts and as a share
of the total. Yet around half of all pesticides applied
are considered moderate-risk to surface water, aquatic
species, and chronic human categories. For the last

three categories in Table 2, avian species, mammalian
species and arthropods, the majority of pesticides applied continues to pose a low-risk.
The percentage changes in the amount of pesticide
applied by risk category between 1983 and 1998 are
listed in Table 3. The percentage changes are important for the valuation exercise to follow as the WTP
values refer to the complete elimination of risk. The
valuations multiply the WTP values (Table l) by these
percentage changes as noted in Eq. (4). There has been
significant reduction in the absolute amount of pesticide that is considered high and moderate-risk for most
of the environmental categories. The amount of pesticide that is high-risk for surface water and acute human categories has increased between 1983 and 1998
by 67 and 31%, respectively. While, the percentage
increases are significant, the total amount still represents less than one-third of the total amount of pesticide applied by risk category. The use of moderate-risk

pesticides fell for all environmental categories except
arthropods. As discussed above, the majority of the
pesticides applied are considered low-risk for this category. The amount that is moderate-risk for arthropods
increased from 0.19 million kg of a.i. in 1983 to 0.69
million kg of a.i. in 1998 but this amount represents
13% of the total applied. In summary, most of the 40%
decrease in the total amount applied between 1983 and
1998 is due to a decrease in high and moderate-risk
pesticides for most of the environmental categories.

3.2.2. Valuation of changes in environmental risk
The values of the changes in environmental risks
posed by pesticides in Ontario evaluated using Eq. (4)
are listed in Table 4. The values indicate the amount an
average household would be willing to pay annually
to experience the percentage change in environmental
risk observed for each time period. The reduction in
external costs associated with the changes in pesticide
use between 1983 and 1998 is US$ 188 per household
annually. Since the total number of households in Ontario in 1993 was 3,781,440, the value of the environmental risk reduction for the entire province over the
last 15 years was 711 million (Canadian)$.
The largest reduction occurred in the last 5-yearperiod with essentially no benefits associated with
changes between 1988 and 1993. The value of the
change in pesticide risk was greatest between 1993
and 1998 since the changes in risk were positive for
all eight environmental categories. The largest benefits accrued respectively to mammalian species, avian
species, chronic human, ground water and aquatic
species. These results are due to the large percentage
reduction in the total amount of pesticide applied

that is considered high-risk to these categories and
the greater value placed by households on a percentage reduction in high-risk pesticides. The external
costs of pesticides did increase over the whole time
period for surface water and arthropods, particularly
between 1988 and 1993. The negative value for the
change in environmental risk for surface water was
due to the increase in the amount of low and high-risk
pesticide applied which more than offset the large decrease in the absolute amount of pesticide considered
moderate-risk for this category. For arthropods, most
of the pesticide applied is considered as low-risk.
Although, this total fell significantly, a relatively
large percentage increase in the amount of medium
risk pesticide applied (see Table 3) accounts for the
negative value change.
The values of the changes in environmental risks
for the period 1983-1998 (last column of Table 4) are
decomposed by risk category in Table 5. The results
emphasise that the environmental benefits are due to
the reduction in the level of high and moderate-risk
pesticides (Table 5). Most categories experienced a
reduction in the external costs from changes in the
levels of pesticides that are considered high-risk for
that category. Exceptions are the surface water and
acute human categories for which the external costs
per household increased by US$ 51 and 22, respectively. Only for the arthropod category was there an
increase in the external costs due to changes in the
use of pesticides considered moderate-risk as noted
above. The overall external costs of low-risk pesticide
use have increased since 1983 due to the increase in
use of these pesticides for four environmental categories (ground water, surface water, acute human, and

chronic human). However, for all these categories except surface water, the increase in cost associated with
increased low-risk pesticide use is smaller than the environmental benefits that result from the reduced use
of pesticides considered to be high or moderate-risk.

4. Conclusions
Designing sound policies to reduce pesticide use requires an assessment of the environmental benefits that
can be compared with the abatement costs for pesticide users and the administrative costs of enforcing the
policy. Previous studies of the environmental impacts
of pesticide use have tended to focus either on measming damages through changes in relative risks to
various environmental categories on or examining the
trade-off between pesticide use levels and abatement
costs. This study uses the physical risk assessment
approach combined with contingent valuation survey
results on consumer's willingness to reduce pesticide
risk. The method developed by Mullen et al. ( 1997)
is used to identify the value of environmental benefits
from changes in the level and types of pesticides applied in Ontario agriculture. The total amount of pesticides applied in Ontario has declined approximately
40% from 8.8 million kg of a.i. in 1983 to 5.2 million
kg of a.i. in 1998. Only for the surface water category
were high-risk pesticides more than one-quarter of the
total amount applied in 1998. The total amount and
share of pesticides that are high-risk for most environmental categories declined over time, particularly in
terms of chronic human and mammalian species effects. There was a similar decrease in the amount of
pesticides used that are considered moderate-risk with

the exception of the arthropod environmental category.
The reduction in total amount applied is due largely to
the reduction in high and moderate-risk categories as
the percentage change in low-risk pesticide use averaged to zero across the eight environmental groups.
The reduction in external costs associated with
the changes in pesticide use between 1983 and 1998
is US$ 188 per household annually, which represents a value of US$ 711 million for the province
as a whole. Once again, the environmental benefits can be attributed to the reduction in the level
of high and moderate-risk pesticide use. The percentage decreases noted for the total amount applied
are weighted by the willingness to pay to eliminate risks, with higher values associated with higher
risks. In most cases, the categories experienced a
reduction in external costs due to reductions in the
use of pesticides that are considered high-risk. Over
70% of the total value associated with the reduction in environmental risk is due to the reduction of
high-risk pesticide use. The overall external costs of
low-risk pesticides have increased since 1983 due
to the increase in use of these pesticides in the categories ground water, surface water and acute and
chronic human health. However, this slight increase
in cost associated with increased low-risk pesticide
use is still significantly smaller than the value of the

environmental benefits that results from the reduced
use of pesticides considered high and moderate-risk.
