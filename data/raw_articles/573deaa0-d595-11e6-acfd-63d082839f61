Abstract
The impact of integrated pest management (IPM) on pesticide use, toxicity and other environmental characteristics, yields, and farm
profits is examined for grape growers. The method is generally applicable for technology adoption and accounts for self-selectivity,
simultaneity, and theoretical consistency. IPM adopters apply significantly less insecticides and fungicides than nonadopters among grape
producers in six states, accounting for most of the U.S. production. Both the average toxicity and the Environmental Impact Quotient
decrease slightly with adoption of insect IPM, but remain about the same for adopters and nonadopters of IPM for diseases. The effect of
IPM adoption on yields and variable profits is positive but only significant for the case of IPM for diseases, i.e., the adoption of IPM for
diseases increases yields and profits significantly. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

1. Introduction
Despite their positive effect on agricultural production, evidenced by the willingness of U.S. farmers to spend US$7. 7 billion on pesticides in 1995
(USDA, 1997), the potential effects of pesticides to
human health and the environment have caused increased concern Huang et al., 1994. In 1993, the
U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Food
and Drug Administration, and the Environmental
Protection Agency pledged to work together to reduce the health and environmental risks associated

with pesticide use. As Integrated Pest Management
(IPM) techniques were designed to address some of
the health and environmental concerns of pesticides,
the USDA has set a goal for the use of IPM on 75%
of U.S. farmland by the year 2000.
Fruit and vegetable production is particularly intensive in pesticides. Per acre expenditures on pesticides by fruit and vegetable growers are nearly seven
times the agricultural average (Fernandez-Cornejo et
al., 1994). In addition, concerns about pesticide
residues are especially important in fruits and vegetables, often consumed with little postharvest processing National Academy of Sciences, 1987. Grape
was the top U.S. fruit crop in terms of acreage
(761,000) and value of production (US$1.8 billion)
in 1994 (USDA, 1995). Grape and wine production
dates back more then 4000 years and extends over

146

all continents. Besides U.S. and traditional European
producers, grapes are grown extensively in some
countries in Eastern Europe, parts of the former
Soviet Union, Africa (Algeria and South Africa),
Australia, Asia, and South America.
IPM includes an assortment of techniques designed to maintain pest infestations at economically
acceptable levels rather than attempting to completely eradicate all pests Vandeman et al., 1994.
While there are several conceptual definitions of
IPM, according to the USDA: "IPM is a management approach that encourages natural control of
pest populations by anticipating pest problems and
preventing pests from reaching economically damaging levels. All appropriate techniques are used such
as enhancing natural enemies, planting pest-resistant
crops, adapting cultural management, and using pesticides judiciously." (USDA, 1993).
While the adoption of IPM has been analyzed by
several researchers (Norton and Mullen, 1994), there
are few farm-level econometric studies on the effect
of IPM on pesticide use, crop yields, and farm
profits (Burrows, 1983; Hall and Duncan, 1984;
Wetzstein et al., 1985; Smith et al., 1987;
Fernandez-Cornejo, 1996). No study has been published analyzing grape production. Moreover, little
farm-level empirical research has been published on
the effect of IPM on the overall toxicity and other
environmental characteristics of pesticides and claims
that pesticides used in IPM differ from those used on
a preventive or routine schedule (Allen et al., 1987)
have not been empirically examined. This paper
presents a framework to examine the impact of IPM
on pesticide use, toxicity and other environmental
characteristics of the pesticides, crop yields, and
farm profits, and calculates the impact of IPM for
U.S. grape growers.

2. Potential health and environmental effects of
pesticide use
The reported undesirable effects of pesticides on
nontarget species, including humans, include the following: acute and chronic health effects (Clark et al.,
1977; EPA, 1976b; Hayes and Vaughn, 1977); domestic animal poisonings (Cadwell et al., 1977); and

effects on wild birds and mammals, fish, bees, beneficial organisms, and small organisms in the soil
(Bairlein, 1990; Brown, 1978; EPA, 1976a; Martin,
1978; Van Steenwyk et al., 1975; Pimentel et al.,
1991.)
A pesticide poses a risk to human health and the
environment if it is toxic and if humans and other
species are exposed to the pesticide (Cohrs sen and
Covello, 1988). Human toxicity is usually inferred
from experimental data on mammalian toxicity.
Mammalian toxicity includes acute (short-term) and
chronic (long-term, low-level exposure) toxicity.
Chronic toxicity includes carcinogenicity (capability
to produce cancer), mutagenicity (ability to induce
genetic changes in living cells), and teratogenicity
(capability to produce malformations or serious deviations from normality).
There are hundreds of pesticide active ingredients
and each has a different spectrum of pest control and
a different impact on human health and the environment (Fernandez-Cornejo and Jans, 1995). Thus, it is
convenient to summarize the toxicity of pesticides in
an overall index. Several methods have been proposed but there is no consensus about the scales and
the weights assigned to the components of the index.
This paper uses the overall index of human toxicity
proposed by Fernandez-Cornejo and Jans (1995).
This index (LTI) is the average of three components,
with equal weights, each scaled from 0 to 4, the 0
corresponding to nontoxic effect. The LAI component summarizes the acute toxicity resulting from the
five different measures considered by the EPA. LAI
is equal to 4 if the active ingredient belongs to
toxicity category I (danger) of the EPA classification; similarly LAI is equal to 3, 2, and 1 for
categories II, III, and IV, respectively. The chronic
element of the index (LCI) is assigned a lower score
for weaker indications of carcinogenicity. Following
Hammitt (1986), LCI is equal to 4 if the pesticide is
a carcinogen; LCI is equal to 2 if the pesticide is not
a reported carcinogen but is a neoplastigen (or oncogenic, i.e., it can produce tumors) and is equal to 0.5
if the pesticide is neither carcinogenic nor oncogenic,
but is mutagenic (indicating potential carcinogenicity). Finally, the LTI component is equal to 4 if the
pesticide is teratogenic.
The potential impact of pesticides on human health
and the environment is approximately quantified us-

J. Fernandez-Cornejo/ Agricultural Economics 18 ( 1998) 145-155

ing the Environmental Quotient Index (Kovach et al.,
1992). The EIQ has three components based on the
three potentially affected elements: the farm worker,
the consumer, and the ecology. The EIQ measures
the impact of each pesticide active ingredient by
assigning an equal weight to each of its three components and has a scale of 1 to 5. The farmworker
component includes acute and chronic elements and
is calculated from mammal toxicity and persistence.
The consumer component is based on chronic toxicity, persistence, and sistemicity. The ecological component is calculated from fish, bird, bee, and beneficial arthropod toxicity; leaching and surface loss
potential, and persistence.

3. Pesticide use and IPM in grape production
Grape production in the U.S. uses a variety of
pesticides. As Table 1A shows, fungicides are applied to 93% of the acreage devoted to grape production; insecticides are used in 66% of the grape acres;

147

and herbicides are used on 64%. Among the important fungicides used, sulfur is first followed by mancozeb, copper oxychoride sulphate, captan, and myclobuthanil (USDA, 1994). Cryolite is the most extensively used insecticide, followed by propargite,
and carbaryl. Commercial bioinsecticides based on
the bacterium Bacillus thuringensis (Bt) are only
used on 2% of the acres (USDA, 1994).
The use of IPM in grape production can be traced
back to the late 1950s when the grape leafhopper
Erythroneura elegantula developed resistance to synthetic organic pesticides and biological upsets of the
spider mites and the grape mealybug followed
(Flaherty et al., 1992). Agricultural scientists from
the University of California, supported by the grape
industry, lay the groundwork to a practical management system integrating chemical, cultural, and biological controls (Flaherty et al., 1992). IPM was
developed further in the 1960s with the use of
predaceous mites and insects and cover crops; and in
the 1970s and 1980s with the use of selective pesti-

cides, parasites, viruses, and fungus to control insects and diseases.

4. The theoretical framework
4.1. Theoretical issues

An econometric model developed to estimate the
impact of IPM adoption using survey data must take
into account three theoretical issues. (1) Farmers'
IPM adoption decisions and pesticide use may be
simultaneous due mainly to unmeasured variables
correlated with both IPM adoption and pesticide
demand such as size of the pest population, pest
resistance, farm location, and grower perceptions
about pest control (Burrows, 1983). (2) Growers are
not assigned randomly to the two groups (adopters
and nonadopters of IPM), but they make the adoption choices themselves. Since adopters and nonadopters may be systematically different, these differences may manifest themselves in farm performance and could be confounded with differences due
purely to IPM adoption. This situation, known as
self-selectivity must be corrected to prevent biasing
the results (Greene, 1993). (3) The demand for pesticides is a derived demand, and must be consistent
with farmers' optimization behavior, such as profit
maximization.
In conclusion, model specification should allow
for simultaneity and self-selectivity. In addition, the
demand and supply functions should be derived from
a profit (or cost) function.
4.2. The adoption decision

The adoption of a new technology is a choice
between two alternatives, the traditional technology
and the new one and growers are assumed to make
decisions by choosing the alternative that maximizes
their perceived utility (Fernandez-Cornejo et al.,
1994). Thus, grower i is likely to adopt IPM if the
utility of adopting, ~ 1 , is higher than the utility of
not adopting, ~ 0 . However, only the binary random
variable Ii (taking the value of 1 if IPM is adopted
and zero otherwise) is observed, as utility is not
known to the analyst with certainty and is treated as
a random variable (Ben-Akiva and Lerman, 1985).

In the context of IPM adoption: Uij = Vu + eii•
where ~i is the systematic component of U, related
to the profitabilities of adopting (j = 1) and not
adopting (j = 0). Assuming that the disturbances
(eii) are independently and identically normally distributed, then their difference will also be normally
distributed and the probit transformation can be used
to model the farmer's adoption decision. Thus, the
probability of adoption equation is P(/k = 1) =
F( y~Zk) where Ik denotes the adoption of IPM for
insects (k = 1) and diseases (k = 2), F indicates the
cumulative normal distribution, and the vector Z
includes the factors influencing adoption.
The equations for the adoption of IPM for insects
and diseases estimated using the probit model are:
11 = L.iy 1iZ 1i + ~-t 1 and / 2 = L./y2 iZ2 i + J-t 2 • The
components Zi of the vector Z include the following
factors of adoption: farm size, output price, farmer
education and experience, off-farm labor, use of
extension and consulting services, contractual arrangements for the production/marketing of the crop,
and type of grape grown (i.e., wine or table grape
varieties). Both probit equations have the same regressors. .
Heckman's two-step procedure (Heckman, 1976)
is modified to account for simultaneity in addition to
self-selectivity. The first step includes the estimation
of the parameters 'Yk of the probit equations. The
inverse Mills ratio Ak = c/J( y~Z/ up)jcJJ( y~Z/ uP-) is
also estimated for each observation, where c/J( ·) and
iP( ·) are the density and the distribution function of
the standard normal, and uP- is the standard deviation of 1-tk (Greene, 1993; Maddala, 1983). Moreover, to account for simultaneity, Ik being endogenous, the predicted probabilities (obtained from the
probit equations) are used as instrumental variables
for Ik in the second stage, discussed next.

4.3. Modeling the impact of !PM

The impact of IPM on pesticide use, yields, and
farm profits is examined by estimating the pesticide
demand functions, the supply function, and the variable profit function as a simultaneous system. To
account for self selectivity, the inverse Mills ratios
Xk (obtained from the first stage) are appended as
additional regressors to the supply, demand, and
profit equations.

J. Fernandez-Cornejo/ Agricultural Economics 18 (1998) 145-155

The well-developed restricted profit function (Diewert, 1974) is used to estimate theoretically consistent supply, demand, and profit equations (Fernandez-Cornejo, 1994). Let Y denote the vector of
outputs, X the vector of variable inputs, S the vector
of nonnegative quasi-fixed inputs; R is the vector of
other factors such as locational or weather proxies
and also includes as components the predicted probabilities of IPM adoption obtained in the first stage; P
is the price vector of outputs, and W is the price
vector of variable inputs. The restricted profit function is defined by:
7T(P, W,S,R)

=

MaxXY(P'Y- W' X;X,Y

E

T)

The production possibilities set T is assumed to
be nonempty, closed, bounded, and convex cone.
Under these assumptions on the technology, the restricted profit function is well defined and satisfies
the usual regularity conditions (Diewert, 1974). In
particular, with some of the inputs fixed, 7T is homogeneous of degree one in output and variable input
prices and quasi-fixed input quantities.
Considering land (L) as a fixed input and using
the homogeneity conditions, the restricted profit
function can be expressed as 7T(P,W,L,R) = L.
iT(P,W,R), where is the per acre profit function:
iT= Maxyx(P'Y- W' X) andY= Y jL,X = XjL
are the per acre output and input quantity vectors. By
Hotteling-Shephard's lemma, the per acre output
supply and input demand functions are then given by
Y= aiT(P, W,R)jaP and i = aiT(P, W,R);aw.
The model is empirically estimated by using a
normalized quadratic variable profit function (Diewert and Ostensoe, 1988). Considering the case of a
single output, grapes, imposing symmetry by sharing
parameters and linear homogeneity by normalization,
using the labor price as the numeraire, appending the
inverse Mills ratio terms as additional regressors, and
adding the disturbance terms, the per acre profit
function, per acre supply function, and per acre
insecticide and fungicide demand functions are:

where now, Y, P, a, H, and the e's are scalars; and
F and G are column matrices. The vector R includes
seven components: two farm attributes (farm size
and off-farm labor), a dummy for the type of grape
produced, the predicted probabilities of adoption of
IPM for insects and diseases obtained from the probit model, and two dummies to account for pest
infestation levels.

5. Data and estimation
The data were obtained from the Agricultural
Chemical Use Survey and its Economic Follow-On
for fruits, administered between the fall of 1993 and
the spring of 1994 by the National Agricultural
Statistics Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The probability sample was drawn from a list
frame based on all known commercial fruit growers
who have at least an acre of production. A stratified
sampling technique was used, where each stratum is
a mutually exclusive set of the commodities.
The survey included fresh market, processing, and
wine grape crops grown in California, Michigan,
New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Washington,
covering 743,000 acres (Table lA) and accounting
for most of the U.S. acreage (USDA, 1995). The pest
management section of the survey was completed by
691 grape-producing growers (Table lB), but after
excluding observations with missing values only 609
usable observations were available for econometric
analysis.
The largest proportion of the producers in the
sample grew wine grape varieties in 1993 (about
80%) followed by raisin, fresh market, and juice
grape varieties (about 10% each). However, the proportion of the acreage growing wine grape varieties

150

J. Fernandez-Cornejo/ Agricultural Economics 18 (1998) 145-155

was lower because farms growing wine varieties
tend to be smaller (for example, the sample average
size for farms growing wine varieties was about 380
acres compared to almost 2500 acres for farms growing raisin varieties). Similarly, while more than 80%
of the 1993 grape acreage was located in California
(Table 1A), the percent of the farms located in
California is much lower, because grape farms in
California are larger that in other states. For example, the sample average grape acreage in California
was 3170, while that of New York was 194 and
Oregon 41 (Table 1B). For this reason, the proportion of California farms in the sample was only
about 20%, similar to that of New York, Michigan,
Oregon and Pennsylvania (Table lB).
It is difficult to provide a general operational
definition of IPM since IPM programs are specific to
the crop and region for which they are designed and
development of IPM programs has not been uniform
across pest classes (e.g., insects, plant pathogens,
weeds), crops, and regions. Most previous econometric studies have dealt with IPM adoption in general,
without further specification of the pest classes that
are managed or controlled. While there is merit in
keeping the definition general, additional understanding about the barriers to adoption, as well as the
effects of IPM, is gained by further characterizing
IPM. Thus, this paper considers separately IPM to
manage insects and diseases.
In our operational definition of IPM, a fanner is
said to have adopted IPM to manage insects (diseases) (i) if the fanner reports having used both
scouting for insects (diseases) and economic thresholds in making insecticide (fungicide) treatment decisions, and (ii) the fanner reports the use of one or
more additional insect (disease) management practices among those considered to be IPM techniques.
Additional IPM techniques included the use of
pheromones; use of resistant varieties; alternating
pesticides to slow the development of pest resistance
to pesticides; adjusting planting dates to lessen pest
problems; soil testing for pests; pruning; purchasing
beneficial organisms that prey on pests; adjusting
application rates, timing, and frequency of pesticide
use to protect beneficial organisms; and use of insecticides less harmful to beneficial insects.
The number of insecticide (fungicide) applications
per year are used as a measure of pesticide use. The

average number of pesticide applications was calculated by dividing the sum (over all active ingredients
in the given pesticide class) of the treatment acres by
the number of acres treated. Correspondingly, pesticide prices were computed in dollars per insecticide
(fungicide) application per acre. Per acre variable
profits are defined as per acre revenues (grape prices
times yields) minus per acre variable costs (insecticides, fungicides, and associated labor costs).
Unlike simple random sampling, the selection of
an individual farm for the survey was not equally
likely across all farms on the list because the sample
was stratified. Weighted least squares estimation
methods were used to correct for bias, with weights
equal to the inverse of the probability of selection.
The probit equations were estimated separately. Because the errors of the estimating equations for the
second stage (Eqs. (1)-(4)) could be correlated, and
to gain estimation efficiency, the per acre supply and
demand equations were estimated together with the
per acre profit function in an iterated Seemingly
Unrelated Regression (ITSUR) framework (Zellner,
1962). However, ITSUR techniques were not needed
for the probit, because the regressors are the same
across all the equations and there are no theoretical
restrictions for the regression coefficients (Dwivedi
and Srivastava, 1978). The impact of IPM adoption
on pesticide use, yields, and farm profits was calculated from Eqs. (1)-(4). For example, the effect of a
change in the probability of adoption of insect IPM
on insecticide use was calculated from Eq. (3) since
3X 1 /3R 3 = E13 . In elasticity form, the effect of
adoption of insect IPM on insecticide use is E 13
(R 3 /X 1 ). The elasticities reported were calculated at
the means.

6. Results
Tables 1B and 2 present a summary of the means
of the data for grape farms. Table 1B provides the
number of growers in the sample and shows the
average extent of adoption of insect IPM and disease
IPM, distributed by state. Separate sample averages
of selected variables for adopters and nonadopters of
IPM for insects and diseases are given in Table 2.
For a binary indicator variable, the mean represents
the fraction of growers of each group with that

Regarding the results from the probit regressions,
both regressions are highly significant, as measured
by likelihood ratio tests (only one probit-regression
estimates are shown in Table 3 for lack of space,
other results are available upon request). Among the
statistically significant variables, the coefficient of
the operator's off-farm work activities, measured by
the number of off-farm work hours is negative, as
expected, confirming that the availability of operator
labor has a positive influence on IPM adoption. This
corroborates other findings (McNamara et al., 1991;
Fernandez-Cornejo et al., 1994) that off-farm employment may present a constraint to IPM adoption,
because it competes for on-farm managerial time, as
IPM requires a substantial amount of operator's time.
Farmer experience is negatively correlated with
adoption. This negative sign may be due to the
correlation of experience with the age of the operator
and would indicate that older farmers are more reluctant to accept newer techniques. Farmer education is
positively correlated with adoption, as expected, but
use of extension and consultants is not significantly
related to IPM adoption. The size variable is positive
and significant, confirming other studies that operators of larger farms are more likely to adopt innovations. The type-of-grape dummy is also significantly
negative, indicating that wine grape growers are less
likely to adopt IPM than table grape producers.
Table 3 also presents the estimated parameters of
the insecticide and fungicide demand functions and
the per acre supply function. The overall goodness of
fit is good for all three equations (adjusted R 2 =
0.27), given the cross-sectional nature of the study.
The coefficients of the inverse Mills ratios are significant in the supply and profit equations, confirming
that self-selection does occur.
Insecticide use is negatively and significantly related to the adoption of insect IPM. Similarly, fungicide use is negatively and significantly related to the
adoption of IPM for diseases. The elasticity of pesticide demand with respect to the probability of adoption of the corresponding IPM (calculated at the
mean) is -0.26 for the case of insecticides and
-0.10 for fungicides (Table 4). That is, a 10%
increase in the probability of adoption of IPM for
insects would decrease the number of insecticide
applications by nearly 3% and a 10% increase in the
probability of adoption of IPM for diseases would

decrease the number of fungicide applications by
1%.
Table 3 also shows that the impact of IPM on
yields is positive for both insect and disease IPM,
although this effect is not significant for insect IPM.
About a third of the ITSUR parameter estimates for
the profit function (not shown but available upon
request) are significant at the 1% level. .The effect of
IPM adoption on profits is positive but only significant for IPM for diseases: the elasticity of variable
farm profits with respect to the probability of adoption of IPM for diseases is 0.39 (Table 4). This result
means that an increase of 10% in the probability of
adoption of IPM for diseases would increase variable
profits by almost 4%.
Our results are consistent with those of Hall
(1977) in that IPM reduced pesticide use. However,
the empirical evidence on the effect of IPM on
pesticide use is mixed, even for a given crop. Among
econometric studies, Burrows (1983) found that IPM
adoption lead to a significant reduction in pesticide
expenditures for a sample of California cotton growers, but Carlson (1980) cites evidence of "both
complementary and substitute relationships between
scouting and pesticide use'' among cotton producers
in North Carolina, and Wetzstein et al. (1985) found
that "IPM has no effect on pesticide expenditures"
among a sample of Georgia cotton farmers. There is
little econometric results on the impact of IPM among

J. Fernandez-Cornejo j Agricultural Economics 18 ( 1998) 145-155

fruit producers (Norton and Mullen, 1994); Fernandez-Cornejo and J ans ( 1996) found that IPM did not
have a significant effect on insecticide use for a
sample of orange producers in California and Florida.
Having determined that IPM reduces overall pesticide use for grape growers, we also examine the
impact of IPM on major pesticide active ingredients.
We focus on 11 active ingredients which represent
more than 90% of the insecticides and fungicides
used on grapes. As shown in Table 5, on the average, adopters of insect IPM use fewer applications of
two of the three major insecticides listed and adopters
of disease IPM use fewer applications of six of the
eight major fungicides.
The overall index of human (mammal) toxicity
(L TI) encompassing both acute and chronic effects is
also calculated for each of the 11 ingredients and
shown in Table 5. In addition, a weighted average
toxicity index is calculated, where the weights are
based on the area treated, application rate, and number of applications. As it can be seen at the bottom
of Table 5, the average toxicity of the insecticides
used by adopters of insect IPM is slightly lower

153

(LTI = 1.7) than that of nonadopters (LTI = 1.8);
both of these toxicities are considered as moderate.
The toxicity of fungicides used is essentially the
same for adopters and nonadopters of IPM for diseases and in both cases the average toxicity of
fungicides is quite low (LTI = 0.35). However, the
fungicide results are strongly influenced by sulfur,
which has a large weight because it is intensively
used in grape production. Sulfur has a low mammal
toxicity (LTI = 0.33).
To examine the environmental impact of IPM we
use the environmental impact quotient (EIQ) (Kovach
et al., 1992). As indicated earlier, the EIQ measures
the impact of each pesticide active ingredient on
human health and the environment. Table 5 provides
the EIQ values of the active ingredients used in
grape production. We also calculate an overall
weighted average EIQ for the major insecticides and
fungicides used. Weights are based on the area
treated, application rates, and number of applications
(Table 5). As seen at the bottom of Table 5, the
overall EIQ of insecticides decreases slightly for
adopters of insect IPM (from 25.2 to 24.7) but the

overall EIQ of fungicides remains the same (at about
45.5) for adopters and nonadopters of IPM for diseases.
7. Concluding comments
This paper presents a methodology to calculate
the impact of IPM on pesticide use, toxicity and
other environmental characteristics of the pesticides,
crop yields, and farm profits. The methodology is
applied to the case of grape producers in six states
accoonting f.or most 0f th€ U.S. production. The
method is :gemenilil.ly applicabJe to technology adoption. It accounts for self-selectivity and simultaneity,
and the pes,ticide demllJld and yield equations are
theorett<;aiiy cqfisis\ertt with a restricted profit functioif '·"''·' ~~ -··· '"'
,.
the results support the notion that, among grape
growers, adopters of IPM for insects and IPM for
diseases use significantly fewer insecticide and
fungicide applications than do nonadopters. In addition, both average toxicity and the environmental
impact quotient decreases slightly with adoption of
insect IPM, but they remain about the same for
adopters and nonadopters of IPM for diseases. The
effect of IPM adoption on yields and variable profits
is positive but only significant for the case of IPM
for diseases, i.e., the adoption of IPM for diseases
increases yields and profits significantly. Other important determinants of pesticide demand, besides
IPM adoption, are pesticide prices, grape prices, pest
infestation levels, type of grape, operator off-farm
work, and farm size.
Two limitations of the study are the incomplete
modeling of the substitution possibilities between
pesticides and other purchased inputs, particularly
fertilizers, and the exclusion of production risk. In
the first case, the limitations are attributable to the
lack of price input data for some inputs. Panel data
would be needed to address the second issue satisfactorily. When better data become available, these
limitations will be surmounted helping improve our
understanding of technology adoption in agriculture.
