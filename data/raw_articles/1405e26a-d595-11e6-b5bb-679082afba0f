Abstract
An econometric procedure for estimating Arrow-Pratt coefficients of risk aversion is derived. The model of farmers allocating land
among different crops, and time between leisure and labor, allows for testing Arrow's hypotheses of decreasing absolute risk aversion and
increasing relative risk aversion. The empirical results support these hypotheses. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

1. Introduction

The seminal works of Arrow (1971) and Pratt
(1964) established that under the expected-utility
hypothesis there exist one-to-one relationships between preferences over random income or wealth
and the measures of risk aversion. Since then, the
various measures of risk aversion have played a
central role in determining comparative static results
of behavior under uncertainty (i.e., Sandmo, 1971;
Just and Zilberman, 1983). In particular, specific
assumptions regarding the signs, magnitudes, and
behaviors with respect to wealth changes of the
measures are required. Commonly, theoretical studies assume positive measures of risk aversion and
adopt Arrow's hypotheses on the effect of wealth on
the measures of risk aversion i.e., decreasing absolute and increasing relative risk aversion.
While there exists some empirical evidence on the
signs and magnitudes of these measures there is a
little empirical evidence on the effect of wealth

changes on them. Thus, the objective of this study is
two-fold: (i) estimating the orders of magnitudes of
the measures of risk aversion; (ii) estimating the
effects of wealth changes on the measures, thereby
testing Arrow's conjectures about their behavior with
respect to income or wealth. It is worthwhile to note
that such empirical results are of special importance
to the agricultural sector. Agricultural production is
characterized by considerable risk and significant
governmental intervention and thus aggregate measures of risk aversion and their properties with respect to wealth have very important policy implications.
The ·literature has attempted to provide empirical
evidence of individuals' risk attitudes. These attempts may be classified into two main approaches:
experimental and econometric. A critical difference
between them is that the former is based on simulations in which individuals are presented with hypothetical questionnaires regarding risky alternatives,
with or without real payments, while the latter has
the advantage of being based on individuals' actual
decisions. The experimental approach, for example,
has been used by Dillon and Scandizzo (1978) to

elicit risk attitudes of subsistence farmers in northeast Brazil, and by Binswanger (1980), Binswanger
(1981) and Quizon et al. (1984) to analyze a fairly
large-scale experiment, with real significant payments, in rural India.
The econometric approach has been used in variety of circumstances. Moscardi and de Janvry (1977),
and Shahabuddin et al. (1986) used such an approach
in which the decision-makers were assumed to follow a safety-first rule. Antle (1987, 1989), Bardsley
and Harris (1987), Love and Buccola (1991), Pope
and Just (1991), and Saha et al. (1994) used econometric approaches to study of risk attitudes of decision-makers assuming expected utility maximization.
Newbery and Stiglitz (1981), Robison (1982), Pope
(1982), Hazell (1982) and Binswanger (1982) present a comprehensive discussion of the relevant literature.
The papers by Pope and Just, Bardsley and Harris, and Saba are the closest to this one. Pope and
Just developed tests for distinguishing between constant absolute, relative, and partial risk aversion. In
contrast, they did not consider an elasticity of risk
aversion and thus did not estimate a systematic way
in which risk aversion differs among individuals.
Hence, the specific hypotheses of Pope and Just are
special cases of the general model of this paper. In
Section 6 we compare our results to others including
Bardsley and Harris, and Saba.
A large body of evidence against the expected
utility hypothesis has been accumulating over past
decades (i.e., Kahneman and Tversky, 1979;
Machina, 1987), raising some doubts as to the importance of the previously mentioned measures. Most of
the violations of the expected utility hypothesis,
however, have been obtained with carefully planned
experiments. Thus, it is unclear whether such violations should prohibit the use of the expected utility
hypothesis when studying real-world decisions. Recently, Bar-Shira (1992) could find no violations of
the expected utility hypothesis in production decisions of Israeli farmers. Rubinstein (1988) indicates
that the expected utility hypothesis is likely to be
violated when alternatives are similar in the sense
that either prizes or probabilities are indistinguishable among the alternatives. Buschena and Zilberman (1992) showed that the expected utility hypothesis is less likely to hold when comparing alternative

pairs that are highly dissimilar in both magnitude
and probability. 1 However, real-life alternatives appear to be relatively similar, but distinguishable.
Thus the expected utility hypothesis is apparently
valid for the purpose of this paper.
This paper proceeds as follows. Section 1 reviews
the relevant literature. Section 2 discusses the relationships between the absolute, relative and partial
measures of risk aversion, and theoretical responses
to changes in income or wealth under each. Section 3
outlines the model and derives some conclusions on
the effect of risk on production. Section 4 gives
empirical background and describes the data. In Section 5, the estimation procedure is outlined. Section
6 presents the results and compares them to results
which have been obtained in other studies. Then
conclusions are presented.

2. Measures of risk aversion: properties and relationships
Arrow and Pratt first introduced the measure of
absolute risk aversion
(1)
A(W)
U"(W)jU'(W),
where W indicates total wealth and U" and U'
indicate the second and first derivatives of the von
Neumann-Morgenstern utility function, respectively.
The measure of absolute risk aversion is appropriate
to describe situations in which total wealth has a
fixed stochastic part-income, and a variable nonstochastic part-initial wealth. Arrow pointed out
that intuition implies that an individual's willingness
to undertake a certain risky project is greater when
hejshe is wealthier. In other words, wealthier individuals should have a greater amount of risky assets
in their portfolio. Thus, the measure of absolute risk
aversion should decrease with wealth.
In situations where both the stochastic and nonstochastic components of the wealth are changing
proportionally, the appropriate measure IS relative
risk aversion,
(2)
R(W)= -(U"(W)jU'(W))W.
Arrow's hypothesis is that when both initial wealth
and the risky project are increased by the same

=-

significantly different from those of the lotteries in the other pair.

Z. Bar-Shira et al. I Agricultural Economics 17 (1997) 211-222

proportion, the individual's willingness to undertake
the risky project is smaller. In other words, wealthier
individuals should hold a smaller proportion of risky
assets in their portfolio. The intuitive hypothesis of
increasing relative risk aversion is also supported
mathematically. Assuming bounded utility
functions, 2 Arrow showed that the measure of relative risk aversion must be greater than unity for
arbitrarily large wealth, and less than unity for arbitrarily small wealth. 3 Thus, a continuous monotone
measure of relative risk aversion must be increasing
with wealth and must be equal to one for some
wealth between zero and infinity.
A third measure of risk aversion is the measure of
partial risk aversion (Menezes and Hanson, 1970;
Zeckhauser and Keeler, 1970),
P ( W0 , 1r)
U" ( W0 + 1r) / U' ( W0 + 1r)) 1r,

=- (

(3)
where W0 denotes nonstochastic initial wealth and 7T
denotes stochastic income. Like the measure of relative risk aversion, this measure is unitless. The measure of partial risk aversion is appropriate to describe
situations in which initial wealth is fixed and income
is variable.
The behavior of the measure of partial risk aversion under wealth changes or risky income changes
can be shown to be determined by the measures of
absolute and relative risk aversion when the measure
of relative risk aversion is increasing with wealth.
The measure of partial risk aversion is related to the
measure of absolute risk aversion as follows:

(4)
Differentiating both sides with respect to W0 gives

=A'1r.

(5)

Hence, decreasing absolute risk aversion implies decreasing partial risk aversion with respect to initial
wealth. The measure of partial risk aversion is related to the measure of relative risk aversion by

( 6)

2 The bounded utility assumption is sufficient to eliminate what
is known as the St. Petersburg paradox (Laffont, 1989, pp. 7-8).
3 To see this, denote relative risk as R, and then integrate twice
the expression U" I U' > - RW.

(7)

Hence increasing relative risk aversion implies increasing partial risk aversion with respect to 7T. The
opposite, however, does not hold. One may have
increasing partial risk aversion with respect to 7T and
decreasing relative risk aversion at the same time.
The above discussion shows that information concerning the behavior of the measures of absolute and
relative risk aversion (when the latter is increasing)
is sufficient to determine the behavior of the measure
of partial risk aversion, but not the opposite (BarShira, 1991). We now show that the elasticity of the
measure of absolute risk aversion with respect to
wealth determines the behavior of both measures of
absolute and relative risk aversion. The elasticity of
the measure of absolute risk aversion with respect to
wealth is defined as
E~

w

=A'-.

(8)

A
Assuming risk aversion, this elasticity is negative
(zero, positive) when the measure of absolute risk
aversion is decreasing (constant, increasing). In addition, because R' =A' W +A > 0 if and only if E,r' >
-1, the measure of relative risk aversion is increasing (decreasing) when the elasticity of absolute risk
aversion is greater (smaller) than minus one. It follows that 0 > E,r' > - 1 is equivalent to decreasing
absolute risk aversion and increasing relative risk
aversion. Note, that E,r' = -1 is equivalent to R' =
A' W +A = 0, or in words, constant relative risk
aversion. The analysis in this section shows that the
elasticity of the measure of absolute risk aversion
with respect to wealth determines the behavior of all
three measures of risk aversion.

3. Methodology
The model presented below describes the following farming situation on an Israeli Moshav: I small
farm owners, who form a village, allocate a fixed
amounts of land L among agricultural activities,
each ~aving net return 7Tj; and a fixed amount of
time T among leisure T 1 and farm work. The technology is assumed to exhibit constant returns to scale

Z. Bar-Shira et al.j Agricultural Economics 17 (1997) 211-222

214

with fixed proportions production. The constant-returns-to-scale assumption is regarded as relatively
innocuous for this paper due to the fact that the total
farm scale is constant in the sample with regard to
both time and land. It follows that increasing one
activity must be accompanied by a decrease in another activity, leading to reallocation of all inputs,
including managerial input. Thus, the increase in size
of some activities can be achieved without the loss
of efficiency usually caused by increasing all inputs
except the managerial input. The technology assumption is further justified by Just et al. (1990).
Furthermore, labor is also a scarce input because
hired labor is not available and all labor input to the
farm has to be supplied by the owner and his family.
In this study the absence of a labor market is due to
the fact that farmers obey the principle of self-employment. 4 The absence of a labor market emphasizes the importance of time allocation between
leisure and agricultural activities in the decision process.
Farmers derive utility from both monetary wealth
and leisure, so that their objective function is a
two-argument utility function. By choosing different
land allocations, the farmers are choosing different
lotteries. In this sense the farmer's problem is the
same as the investor's problem, the latter having to
decide on an asset portfolio. Each farmer is assumed
to act as an expected utility maximizer, and his
decision problem can be written as
maxE[U(W,T 1)]

is a vector whose typical element ~ is the time
required to cultivate one unit of land planted with
crop j, and E is the expectation over the distribution
of profits. The first constraint (Eq. (9.a)) is the time
constraint reflecting that the total amount of available time minus time spent on farm activities is
equal to time devoted to leisure. The second constraint (Eq. (9.b)) is the capacity constraint indicating
that total cultivated land can not exceed the total
amount of available land. 5
Substituting the time constraint (Eq. (9.a)) into
the objective function (Eq. (9)) and assuming that the
capacity constraint (Eq. (9.b)) is not binding, 6 the
first-order conditions are
aE[U]
aL =E[7T· Uw] -E[T· UT1] =0

(10)

where Uw and UT 1 are the partial derivatives with
respect to wealth and leisure, respectively.
The interpretation of the first-order condition is
straightforward: one more unit of time allocated to
either leisure or one of the crops will generate, on
average, the same utility increase. Thus, in the absence of a labor market, the cost of labor is determined by its opportunity cost in terms of leisure. In
addition, the cost of labor is endogenous to the
decision-maker, and hence the optimal production
scheme is different from the optimal decision when
the cost of labor is exogenous (as in a situation
where hired labor is available).
Another factor that affects the optimal decision is
risk. Following Sandmo (1971), it can be shown that
(7T/~) · Uw > UT1 for a risk-averse individual (A >
0). Thus, in the case of decreasing marginal utility
from leisure, the individual consumes more leisure
under uncertainty than under certainty. Furthermore,
in this model under certainty, the individual grows
only one crop, the crop for which the profit per unit
of time is maximum, and leisure is consumed to the
point where its marginal utility is equal to the
marginal utility from one more unit of time allocated

5 Note that this decision problem is static in nature. Generalizing this framework following the dynamic model of agricultural
decision making under risk of Hertzler (1991) would also be
desirable but is beyond the scope of this paper.
6 Note that in this study, observed land allocations sum to less
than total land available on the farm.

Z. Bar-Shira et al. /Agricultural Economics 17 ( 1997) 211-222

to the chosen crop. Under uncertainty, however, the
farmer grows more than one crop, and leisure is
consumed to the point where its marginal utility is
less than the marginal utility from the lowest profit
per unit of time. Thus, it appears that risk-averse
farmers diversify risks by choosing a crop portfolio.
This has led researchers to model the choice of crop
portfolio in the same framework as choice of an
asset portfolio. Generally, the approach is to find the
efficient frontier in the mean-variance plane by
quadratic programming, and then to deduce the magnitude of the risk-aversion coefficient from the slope
of the frontier at the chosen point. The econometric
estimation approach has the advantage of straightforward hypotheses testing.
A Taylor series expansion of Uw around expected
wealth, W = W0 + 1T' L (where 1T = E[ 7T ]), for nonrandom leisure yields

Now let the measure of absolute risk aversion, A,
vary with W

The functional form, A= a W.B, is sufficiently flexible to accommodate either risk-seeking or risk-averse
behavior-a greater than (smaller than) zero implies
risk aversion (risk seeking). Further, it does not
restrict the sign of the elasticity of absolute risk
aversion with respect to W, given by

( 14)
As demonstrated above, f3 determines the behavior
of the three measures of risk aversion discussed
above with respect to changes in wealth. Substituting
the functional form for the measure of absolute risk
aversion into the first order conditions gives

implicit cost of labor per unit of land. 7 The implicit
cost of labor reflects the opportunity cost of time in
terms of leisure, translated to monetary worth by the
marginal rate of substitution between leisure and
money. In this form, the first-order conditions parallel the usual optimality conditions under uncertainty,
where profits minus costs are equated to the risk
premium.

Since L is observed directly and cp and 1T bar can
be estimated from the available data, this relationship
is estimable if Wand TUTz/Uw are directly observable. To attain estimability, one needs estimates for
W 0 and T. Under the permanent income hypothesis
of Friedman, the individuals' consumption and hence
saving is proportional to permanent income. As a
consequence, the initial wealth at each time point is
the sum of all past discounted expected profits multiplied by the marginal propensity to save. Formally

years before the beginning of the data set, by the

Let the profit minus implicit cost of labor be

corresponding coefficient. Note that the farmer's
characteristics reflect differences in the farmer's ability (i.e., the time required to cultivate one unit of

4. Empirical background and data
The methodology presented in the previous section is used in this section to estimate the risk
attitudes of individual farmers of the same age group
in southern Israel. Data were collected by the accounting office of Moshav Bin-Yahav. This cooperative settlement is located in the Arava region of
Israel. The Arava encompasses the plains between
the Red Sea and the Dead Sea. It is an arid region
with low minimum and high maximum temperatures,
making it an off-season producer of vegetables for
local and export markets. Other than a handful of
additional settlements, the Arava region is sparsely
populated. Each farm on the moshav is privately
controlled, and its economic life depends on its

profitability. Output marketing and input purchasing
are done cooperatively because of scale advantages.
The moshav members accept the principles of selfemployment and mutual collaboration as their ideological basis. The social behavioral norms in this
kind of settlement are very stringent. New candidates
for membership have to meet these norms and the
majority of the members have to approve their admittance. The strictness of these rules leads to a
homogeneous population in terms of preferences.
Hence it is reasonable to consider the differences in
preferences as a secondary (and differences in wealth
as the primary) factor affecting risk attitude.
The data set has two parts. The first contains
socioeconomic variables in the following order: diligence, thrift, management, experience, spouse work,
agricultural knowledge, motivation, land quality, education, and risk-seeking attitude. These variables
describing farmer characteristics were constructed by
means of a Delphi panel assembled from among the
moshav leaders and farm advisors. The variables are
rated from one to five and represent the consensus of
the panel. The higher the number, the better the
attribute, for example the better the management
ability, the higher the land quality, or the greater the
spousal contribution. The second part of the data set
contains a cross-section time series sample on 101
farmers over 10 years (1973-1982). It contains aggregated variables consisting of total water use, total
water cost, and expenditure on other inputs such as
pesticides, fertilizers, and cultivating materials. The
arid conditions and the remoteness of any outside
water source make water the most critical input.
Thus, drip irrigation, a very efficient way of using
water, is the dominant technology. Disaggregated
data on cultivated land, yield, and revenue are available by crop for bell peppers, tomatoes, onions,
eggplant, and melons. Almost all farmers grow tomatoes, bell peppers and melons. A smaller number
also grow eggplant and onions. The accounting office, in most cases, does not record input expenditure
by crop, but it does record total input expenditure.
One can use a behavioristic approach to recover the
input expenditure per crop (Just et al., 1990), and
then to recover the profit for each crop per unit of
land. Two main factors cause the opportunity cost of
land to be zero. First, there is no market for land
because the land is owned by the government, and

z.

Bar-Shira et al. j Agricultural Economics 17 ( 1997) 211-222

renting or selling it is illegal. Second, the land is
allocated to the farmer in sufficient amount, such
that the self-employment principle binds the time
constraint before the land constraint becomes binding.

The decision process is based on subjective expectations of future profit, as well as on expected
variance of future profit. Future profit expectations
are assumed to be based on previous years' profits.
Since no farmer grows every crop every year some
values are missing. A farmer who has such missing
values is assumed to form perceptions of profit for
those years based on farms which are similar to
his jher own in terms of size, location, and owner
wealth. These missing values are estimated by regressing profit on year and farmer dummies. That is

Future profit expectations in an environment
which is Markovian up to white noise tend to be
adaptive in nature (see Just, 1977). 8 Thus, farmer's
expectations can be estimated by a weighted average
of actual profit (or its prediction when the actual
value is missing) over past years, where the coefficients sum to one and decline at a geometric rate (for
more on the optimality of this procedure see Just,
1977). Following Berhman (1968), the actual estimation was based on only the past 3 years' profit,
because most of the explanatory power is in the
profit of the last few years, and because of insufficient data. Adapting Just (1974), the estimated expected profit for farmer i at time t is

A simple grid search may be used to identify the
maximum likelihood estimate of ().
The endogenous variable L appears on both sides
of Eq. (21), implying a simultaneity problem. To
resolve it, we used a two-stage instrumental variable
approach. The instruments were the first and second
moments of the profit distribution function, i.e., the
means and the components of the variance matrix
(20 variables). Because there is no component of the
variance matrix on the right-hand side of Eq. (21),
the equation is identified.
The first stage involves an instrumental logit

covariance of crop i and crop j. We use t e mmlmum chi-square method to estimate this logit model
(Maddala, 1983). Specifically, we minimized the
weighted sum of squared errors where the weights
were (LskS 1 )t. Consequently, the resulting estimates
are best linear unbiased estimates. Note that Eq. (27)
implicitly assumes that the decision process is a
sequential one: in the first step the farmer decides on
total amount of land to be cultivated; in the next he
decides on the allocation of cultivated land among
the five crops. The second stage involves replacing
the land allocations on the right-hand side of Eq.
(21) by their predicted values obtained from the
instrumentallogit model.

218

Z. Bar-Shira et al.j Agricultural Economics 17 ( 1997) 211-222

Finally, before proceeding to estimation, we consider possible variation in risk attitude cross individuals. Following previous studies (Dillon and Scandizzo, 1978; Moscardi and de Janvry, 1977; Binswanger, 1980, 1981, 1982; Shahabuddin et al., 1986)
concerning elicitation of risk attitudes, we related
variation in risk attitude to variation in socioeconomic characteristics among individuals. Specifically, we replace the parameter a in Eq. (21) by a
linear combination of the characteristics. This allows
magnitudes of the measures of risk aversion to vary
across individuals but keeps the elasticity of absolute
risk aversion, {3, constant. Thus the estimated value
for f3 should be interpreted as an estimate of aggregate elasticity. The extent to which the hypothesis of
constant elasticity is credible depends on the empirical background.

6. The results
The ratio Sk / S1 is expected to increase in m k
and decrease in m 1 because the higher the profit of a
crop, the greater the amount of land allocated to it.
This ratio is also expected to decrease in vkk and
increase in v 11 because for risk-averse individuals
the higher the variance of a crop, the smaller the
amount of land allocated to it. Table 1 shows the
results of the four instrumentallogit regressions. Out
of 16 signs, only one has a significant opposite sign.

Table 2 gives the regression results of Eq. (21).
The first and most important finding is that the
elasticity of the measure of absolute risk aversion is
-0.316. The associated T-ratio shows that it is
significantly different from zero as well as from 1.
Thus we accept the hypotheses of decreasing absolute risk aversion and increasing relative risk aversion over the simple alternative of constant absolute
risk aversion or constant relative risk aversion. The
derived behavior of the measure of partial risk aversion is straightforward: it increases with income and
decreases with wealth. The results reported in Table
2 were obtained for r = 0.04 which was the real
interest rate during the observed time, and by assigning the marginal propensity to save, b, a value of
0.2. This value was confirmed by the moshav leaders
as being realistic. Furthermore, we performed a sensitivity analysis to verify how robust the results were
to changes in the marginal propensity to save. Table
3 shows the estimated values of ln a and f3 for
different values of b. For b = 0.10 the estimated
values for Ina and f3 were -10.51 and -0.37,
respectively. For b = 0.30 the estimated values for
ln a and f3 were - 11.62 and - 0.29, respectively.

Thus, the estimates for ln a and f3 appear to be
robust to changes in b, i.e., the derived qualitative
conclusions on the behavior of the measures of risk
aversion with respect to wealth or income changes
are the same.
It is interesting to compare our results to those of
others. A straightforward comparison is possible with
Binswanger (1981), whose estimation of the elasticity of the measure of absolute risk aversion with
respect to wealth was - 0.32. This is strikingly close
to our finding. A less straightforward comparison is
possible with Bardsley and Harris, who reported
results for three different zones. Their estimations of
the elasticity of the measure of partial risk aversion
with respect to income and wealth were in the ranges
of 0.129 to 0.194, and -0.312 to -0.642, respectively. One can easily verify that the following relaW
tionships hold: (a) E~ = E4-o, that is, the elastica

W

ity of the measure of partial risk aversion with
respect to initial wealth is equal to the elasticity of
the measure of absolute risk aversion with respect to
wealth multiplied by the share of nonstochastic

E: = E4-w + 1, that is,
1T

wealth in total wealth; (b)

the elasticity of the measure of partial risk aversion
with respect to the random income is equal to the
elasticity of the measure of absolute risk aversion
with respect to wealth times the share of the random
income in total wealth plus 1. Thus, our finding that
the elasticity of the measure of absolute risk aversion
is equal to - 0.316 is equivalent to elasticities of the
measure of partial risk aversion with respect to initial
wealth and random income of -0.19 and 0.95,
respectively. 9 Whereas Bardsley and Harris' results
are consistent with ours qualitatively, the magnitude
of their estimated elasticity of the measure of partial

9 Note that, as reported below, the share of initial wealth in
total wealth is 0.8 at the median points.

risk aversion with respect to random income appears
to be much lower than ours.
The estimated effects of farmer characteristics on
risk aversion are detailed in the central part of Table
2. The most significant characteristics are diligence,
management, experience and education. Notably,
farmers with a higher level of experience as well as
farmers with better managerial abilities exhibit a
lower degree of risk aversion. The intuition is simple. Risk is a complicating factor which farmers with
less experience or less managerial ability try to
avoid. Higher levels of education are associated with
higher risk aversion, suggesting that educated farmers understand better how to avoid risk. Diligence is
also associated with higher risk aversion. A possible
explanation might be that farmers who work harder
can reduce ex-post risk and thus appear risk-averse
ex-ante.
The effects of farmer characteristics on the implicit cost of labor (bottom part of Table 2) can be
divided into direct and indirect effects. The direct
effect is due to the impact of the characteristics on
the time required to cultivate one unit of land. The
indirect effect comes through the marginal rate of
substitution between leisure and money. When less
time is devoted to farm activities, more time is
devoted to leisure so the marginal rate of substitution
goes down. Hence both effects work in the same
direction. Diligence, agricultural knowledge and, to a
lesser extent, education are expected to have positive
coefficients because they are likely to reduce the
time required to cultivate one unit of land. Thrift
should have a positive coefficient because thrifty
persons tend to waste less time (or to save more
time). When land quality and labor are substitute
factors, the land quality is also expected to have a
positive coefficient. The cost of labor may increase
with management and experience: people who work
harder and longer may get higher yields and hence
be characterized as having higher management ability and experience.
Statistics describing the three coefficients of risk
aversion, initial wealth, expected profit, expected
wealth, and the implicit costs of labor for the five
crops are reported in Table 4. A complete illustration
of the distributions of initial wealth, the measure of
partial risk aversion, and the implicit cost of labor is
given by their estimated empirical densities, depicted

in Figs. 1-3, respectively. The medians of expected
and initial wealth are US$139,000 and US$107,000,
respectively. These values are close to reality. The
median coefficient of absolute risk aversion is
0.0000044. The median coefficient of relative risk
aversion is 0.615. The median coefficient of partial
risk aversion is 0.117. For comparison, Saha et al.
(1994) estimated the measure of relative risk aversion for Kansas wheat farmers to be 5.4 and Antle
( 1987) estimated the measure of partial risk aversion
of Indian farmers to be in the range of 0.19 to 1.77.
Binswanger reported similar results: his estimated
measure of partial risk aversion was between 0.32
and 1.72 for the majority of the individuals. Antle
(1989) re-confirmed his 1987 findings by reporting a
mean partial risk aversion of 1.11 for one village and
1.14 for the other. We find the measure of partial
risk aversion to be in the range of 0.04 to 0.52. Thus,
our sample of Israeli farmers exhibits a lower degree
of partial risk aversion than that of Indian farmers.

Bardsley and Harris found the measure of partial risk
aversion at the median point to be 0.072, 0.099, and
0.696, for their three different zones of Australia.
Hence, in two of the zones, Australian farmers exhibited lower degrees of partial risk aversion than
Israeli farmers, whereas in the third zone the degree
of partial risk aversion was similar to that of the
Indian farmers. Our estimated measure of relative
risk aversion has a median value of 0.615. Peppers
are allotted the highest labor cost, with a median of
US$1172 followed by tomatoes with a median of
US$929, onions with a median of US$649, melons
with a median of US$303, and eggplant with a
median of US$236. These results are compatible
with reality, where peppers and tomatoes are highlabor crops, and eggplant and melons are low-labor
crops.
To confirm our results, we note that total wealth
is positively correlated with the risk-seeking attitude
variable constructed by the Delphi panel (with a
correlation coefficient of 0.46). The main criterion
guiding the Delphi panel members in evaluating the
risk-seeking attribute was the farmer willingness to
adopt new technology such as a new variety, pesticide, fertilizer, etc. This positive correlation means
that the richer the farmer, the less risk-averse he is.

Hence this finding is consistent with the evidence of
decreasing absolute risk aversion presented above.

7. Summary and conclusions
This paper develops a methodology to assess the
effect of wealth changes on the measures of absolute,
relative, and partial risk aversion. The behavior of all
three measures were shown to be determined by a
single parameter, the elasticity of absolute risk aversion with respect to wealth. Regarding Israeli farmers, our main findings were that the measure of
absolute risk aversion decreases with wealth, the
measure of relative risk aversion increases with
wealth, and the measure of partial risk aversion
increases in risky income and decreases with nonstochastic initial wealth. These findings suggest empirical evidence supporting Arrow's hypotheses. 10
