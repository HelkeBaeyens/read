Abstract
In developing countries livestock are kept not only for their physical products, but also for insurance, financing, and to display
status. Though this range of purposes is acknowledged, livestock policies nevertheless often emphasize physical production:
a limited perspective that hampers the formulation and implementation of effective livestock policies. This article presents
a comprehensive appraisal of costs and benefits of livestock systems that takes into account the institutional environment of
livestock keepers. Indicators are developed that capture, quantify, and organize not only the benefits resulting from the physical
production, but also those from the intangible functions. The method is illustrated by an analysis of cattle in the Western Province
of Zambia. The results indicate that the perspective on livestock systems developed more closely reflects the observed decisions
of the livestock keepers.

1. Introduction
Millions of agrarian households in developing countries keep livestock as their main agricultural enterprise or as an enterprise linked to crop production. The
roles livestock play in these households are manifold:
the production of milk, meat, hides, manure, draught
power, etc. as well as the accumulation of wealth, security against contingencies, and display of status. These
various roles are acknowledged, with animal scientists usually concentrating on physical production, and
social scientists additionally including aspects of financing, insurance, and status display in their analysis
(Baker and Bhargava, 1974; Bosman and Moll, 1995;

1998).
Livestock development policies, including research
policies, generally focus on the physical production
of livestock systems, often with an emphasis on marketed production (Behnke, 1985), and thereby neglect
the multiple functions of livestock. One of the ways
in which this restricted perspective on production becomes apparent is in the issue of the productivity of
“traditional” livestock systems, such as cattle grazed
on communal land or free-roaming goats. Policy analysts generally describe these systems as “low productive,” because the off-take rate is well below potential
levels. Livestock keepers, however, seem to be much
less concerned with productivity in this narrow sense,
and are prepared to keep low productive animals in

182

their herds. The apparently divergent perspectives on
livestock by policy analysts (and policy makers) and
by livestock keepers hampers the formulation of effective livestock policies that take into account both the
government’s and livestock keepers’ viewpoints.
The difference in perspectives on livestock arises
largely because policy analysts exclude the institutional environment of livestock keepers, whereas
livestock keepers include it. In developing countries
this institutional environment is characterized by illfunctioning, absent, or nonaccessible markets for products, production factors, finance, and insurance. This
means that the values of resources used for and products derived from livestock are not necessarily reflected
in market prices, and that livestock attains roles in insurance, financing, and display of status. The latter
was clearly demonstrated by Bennison et al. (1997)
in a study of cattle keepers in The Gambia where the
primary production objective proved to be the generation of savings, security, and asset protection. In this
situation the standard cost–benefit analysis has serious
shortcomings and the results rarely reflect the perspectives of livestock keepers. It should therefore come as
no surprise that livestock keepers often use production methods that deviate from the “optimal” methods
envisaged by policy analysts.
This article presents an appraisal of costs and benefits of livestock systems that aims to make policy analysis and resulting livestock policies more effective by
focusing on the total complex of market and nonmarket
relationships of the livestock system within the broader
context of the institutional environment of livestock
keepers. The approach is based on: (a) a distinction between recurrent production and embodied production
to deal separately with regular income streams and irregular income from the sale of animals; (b) a distinction between marketed and nonmarketed resources and
production, which leads to a discussion of prices and
values for individual livestock keepers; and (c) recognition and estimation of the services livestock provide in insurance, financing, and status display. The
approach is applicable to all types of animals, either
individually or in herds. In this the analysis deviates
from the approach followed by Crotty (1980) who developed separate models for various types of animals.
The approach builds on the discussion of measuring the
benefits of livestock by Behnke (1985) and expands
the economic analysis to include the consequences

of the institutional environment of livestock keepers.
The outcome is a combination of cash income, noncash
income, and intangible benefits instead of profitability as a single parameter. The appraisal complements biophysical livestock and crop–livestock models
(Devendra and Thomas, 2002a, 2002b; Thornton and
Herrero, 2001) that primarily focus on the relationships between livestock and crop enterprises and their
physical environment as these quantified biophysical
relationships form the starting point for the valuation
and assessment of resources and products.
Section 2 deals with the method in four steps. In
Section 3 the approach is applied to cattle grazed on
natural pasture in Western Province, Zambia. Conclusions about the method are given in Section 4.
2. The method
The appraisal starts with the organization of the
quantified resources used for a livestock system and
the physical production obtained. Thereafter follows
the valuation of resources and physical production
within the farm household system, taking into account
the presence or absence of markets for resources and
production. The benefits derived from the functions of
livestock in insurance, finance, and status display are
discussed in the third stage, and in the final appraisal
the total benefits of the livestock system are related
to the household’s production factors utilized, thereby
taking into account their options and preferences. The
analysis is depicted in Fig. 1.
The focus of the analysis is on the livestock system,
but this livestock system is part of the farm household
system that may comprise crop and care systems, as
well as other on-farm and off-farm enterprises. The
possible relationships between livestock and crop systems are included in this analysis. The position of the
livestock system vis-`a-vis other on-farm and off-farm
enterprises will be briefly outlined at the end of this
section.
2.1. Resources and production
Biophysical input–output data of the livestock system form the starting point of the analysis. These data
are generally annual averages per herd in a steadystate situation, or averages per type of animal over

H. A. J. Moll / Agricultural Economics 32 (2005) 181–193

183

or given away. The embodied production per period
is usually measured by subtracting the embodied production at the end of period t − 1 from the embodied
production at the end of period t.
2.2. Prices and values of resources and production

its lifetime. The input–output data are thus the interface between, on the one hand, the complex biophysical processes that deal with reproduction, growth, and
mortality, and on the other hand the valuation of inputs
used and outputs obtained that result in an ex post assessment of the benefits of the system (Bosman et al.,
1997).
In this method, the resources used in livestock production are split into recurrent purchased inputs and
the household’s production factors directly employed,
such as family labor, land, and capital invested in animals and stables. Examples of recurrent purchased
inputs are medicines and drugs, feed supplements and
fodder, hand tools, hired labor, and veterinary services.
The reason for this distinction lies in the valuation of
the resources, which is dealt with in the next sections.
Livestock production is separated into recurrent production and embodied production. Recurrent production becomes available according to the livestock’s
type, sex, age, and the season. Examples are products
and services such as milk, wool, manure, and draught
power. Embodied production refers to changes in body
weight, pregnancy (as proof of fertility), and change in
capabilities through training, or to changes in numbers
of animals if the analysis is at herd level. Embodied
production is thus production that is not consumed
but that is kept in animals as an investment. This investment results in future recurrent production or it
becomes available when animals are slaughtered, sold,

To assess the contribution of livestock to the income
of the livestock keeper the resources used and production obtained must be valued. This valuation is not a
straightforward process, as markets for resources and
products are imperfect or even absent and thus do not
provide prices. Moreover, livestock keepers may have
differential access to markets, which means that the
price obtained by farmer x may differ from the price
obtained by farmer y, while for farmer z, who has no
access to that market, neither price is relevant.
Some of the resources and products are valued
through markets where supply and demand conditions result in prices. The nonmarketed resources and
products are valued within the households, using as
a yardstick the combination of resources, options for
using these resources, and preferences specific to that
household.
For the analysis of the recurrent production, the distinction between marketed and nonmarketed outputs,
the former with market prices and the latter with estimated prices (both at farm gate level), is maintained in
the following two indicators.
The net recurrent cash income in period t, Yct , is
defined as
Ytc = rjtm pjtm − (ait pit ),

(1)

with
rm
jt the quantity of recurrent marketed production j in
period t, with j = 1, . . . , l;
a it the quantity of recurrent purchased input i used in
period t, with i = 1, . . . , n;
the
price for recurrent marketed output j; and
pm
jt
p it the price of recurrent purchased input i.
The net recurrent cash income is a partial indicator,
but a major one for farm households, as they usually
strive for cash income to pay for school fees, medical
treatment, and the purchase of consumer goods.

184

H. A. J. Moll / Agricultural Economics 32 (2005) 181–193

The recurrent income in kind in period t, Ytk , is defined as
Ytk = rjtn pjtn ,

(2)

with
rnjt the quantity of recurrent nonmarketed production j
in period t, with j = 1, . . . , l;
pnjt the estimated price for nonmarketed output j.
The nonmarketed recurrent production is consumed,
exchanged, or invested and as such is observable by
farm households and implicitly valued. The valuation
through estimated prices is for analytical purposes.
The aggregate value of the various types of embodied production is reflected in the sale price of an
animal. For slaughter animals the sale price is usually
just the total weight times the price per kg live weight.
For dairy or draught animals the sale price normally
reflects the expected capability for future production.
Markets for slaughter animals are usually present, but
markets for animals in their productive period may be
thin, and in such cases, prices must be estimated. The
value of the embodied production in year t, Vet , is calculated by subtracting the sale price of the animal(s) at
the end of period t, P t , from the sale price at the end of
period t − 1, P t−1 :
Vte = Pt − Pt−1 .

(3)

The embodied value in a year can be negative due to
loss of body weight, or reduced production prospects.
The combination of the net recurrent cash income,
the recurrent income in kind, and the embodied production, all over period t, gives the gross margin for
period t:
GM t = Ytc + Ytk + Vte .

(4)

The gross margin is the comprehensive indicator for the
value of the net on-farm physical production of the livestock system obtained by using the households’ production factors. Combining the three components into
one indicator facilitates the analysis, but for livestock
keepers this one indicator is not observable. However,
as the components each are observable we may assume
that farm households take them all into account in their
assessment of livestock systems.
The valuation of the household’s production factors
labor, land, and capital directly employed in the system
is discussed in the final analysis in Section 2.4.

2.3. The functions of livestock in insurance,
financing, and status display
The functions of livestock as security against contingencies, as a means of financing, and in the display
of status are significant in communities where it is difficult or impossible to fulfill these functions by other
means. The absence or ill-functioning of markets for
finance and insurance in developing countries, especially in rural areas, has been widely documented by,
for example, Von Pischke et al. (1983), Binswanger
and Rosenzweig (1986), Adams and Fitchett (1992),
Bosman and Moll (1995), and Hoogeveen (2000). The
consequence of the absence or restricted presence of
finance and insurance institutions is that to cope with
the vagaries of life, people in rural areas search for alternatives within their sphere of command. Among the
possibilities are keeping livestock, hoarding gold and
jewelry, and investing in tree crops.
The insurance function of livestock results from the
potential of being able to sell the animals in case of
emergencies. Having animals is thus comparable with
having insurance, and the absence of the need to pay
a premium can be considered the average intangible
benefit. Sieff (1999) analyzed the relationship between
wealth and livestock dynamics of the marginalized
Datoga pastoralists in Tanzania and showed that the
poorest households were forced to sell more animals
than were replaced by reproduction, and thus were
faced with dwindling herds. This reflects an extreme
situation: the households are not only too poor to keep
low productive animals as insurance, but they are also
forced to sell their productive animals. The insurance
function is important not only in situations where no
other means of storing wealth are available, but even
when there are other insurance options, because animals are easily convertible assets.
Insurance premiums provide cover to a specified
limit for a determined period, and the benefit of insurance, Bst , is therefore related to the average value of
animals for period t:
Bts = bs (Pt−1 + Pt )/2,

(5)

where bs is a factor indicating a proportion of the average sale value. To estimate the factor bs , the alternative
insurance options must be assessed. In their analysis of
dwarf goats in Southern Nigeria, Bosman et al. (1997)

H. A. J. Moll / Agricultural Economics 32 (2005) 181–193

used an informal life insurance system described by
Ibe (1992), with an annual premium of around 0.10 as
reference. Ayalew (2000) has discussed informal group
insurance in the Ethiopian highlands and estimated the
insurance benefit of goats to be 0.083 of the average
value of the stock. If alternative options are not present
a guesstimate is required, and a range from 0.05 for stable situations without major weather risks to a factor of
0.20 for situations with severe risks, seems justifiable.
The function of livestock in financing is noticeable
in three phenomena: the purchase of animals when
income exceeds consumption requirements (Dercon
and Krishnan [1996] discuss income portfolios in rural
Ethiopia and Tanzania); the investment of embodied
production; and, the sale of animals predominantly for
immediate consumption or investment requirements.
The latter phenomenon is recognized in different circumstances. Behnke (1985) states in a discussion on
the price of camels, “richer Bedouin continued to sell
a limited number of animals in order to meet their perceived essential rice requirements”; Low (1986) formulated the “sale for specific cash needs” hypothesis in
the context of cattle marketing in Swaziland; and Moll
and Dietvorst (1999) found in the Western Province of
Zambia that livestock keepers just sold cattle in case of
a substantial and urgent requirement of cash. Selling
livestock to meet specified requirements has a number
of advantages:
• hedge against inflation, as the real value of livestock
generally remains fairly stable;
• there is no need to keep cash safe (this is difficult in
rural circumstances);
• the presence of cash is avoided, thereby averting
possible claims from others that are difficult to refuse
for social reasons;
• avoidance of storage losses if animals are exchanged
for goods;
• avoidance of the cost involved in borrowing for consumption or investment purposes.
The benefit of financing through animals thus results
from the avoidance of cost involved either in storing
money or goods, or in borrowing. However, the sale of
animals when there is a need, and not at the optimal
moment as determined by the physical production or
prices, implies a trade-off between the benefit from
financing and the maximal cash returns.

185

The measurement of the function in financing must
focus on the sale (or direct consumption) of animals
because this forms a clearly identifiable event, and because measuring the outflow covers previous investment behavior through the accumulation of embodied
production and the purchase of animals. The benefit of
financing, B f , is related to the sale price:
f

Bt = bfPt ,

(6)

where b f is a proportion of the sale price. The factor
b f can be estimated by considering the cost or loss
incurred in alternative ways of financing, such as: having a savings account; storing grain; obtaining informal credit; or, pawning jewelry or durable consumer
goods. In the studies by Bosman et al. (1997) and
Ayalew (2000) the estimates are based on the avoidance
of inflation for Nigeria, and on commercial interest
rates for short- and medium-term credit for Ethiopia,
respectively, resulting in values for b f of 0.06 and 0.10.
The function of livestock in providing status to their
owners is related to the presence or absence of other
means to display wealth, such as durable consumer
goods and building materials. Status may not be an
entirely intangible benefit, as it may play a role in acquiring influence, and subsequently increasing access
to resources. The benefit from providing status is, as
in insurance, related to the average value of an animal
(or animals) over period t:
p

Bt = bp (Pt−1 + Pt )/2,

(7)

where b p is a proportion of the average value. For an
estimate of factor b p a value below the value for insurance seems appropriate as insurance, which may mean
survival, generally has a higher priority than status.
At best, estimating the factors bs , b f , and b p determining the benefits in insurance, financing, and status
display is guided by alternatives that vary in relevance.
Actual estimates thus require subjective judgments,
and so are open to debate. Yet in situations where markets are absent or ill-functioning, debatable estimates
are unavoidable.
2.4. The analysis
The total benefit derived from livestock production
is composed of the gross margin plus the benefits from

186

H. A. J. Moll / Agricultural Economics 32 (2005) 181–193

insurance, financing, and status display. The benefit in
financing is measured over animals sold (or consumed,
or given away), whereas the benefits of insurance and
status display are measured over animals kept. The
distinction between stock and flow leads to a separation
between the analysis for an individual animal and the
analysis at herd level.
The analysis of an individual animal over its lifetime
results in two indicators: the annual benefits of keeping
the animal
p

Btk = Ytc + Ytk + Bts + Bt ,

(8)

composed of cash, products consumed, and the benefits in insurance and status display; and, the one-time
benefit of selling the animal:
f

Bts = Pt + Bt ,

(9)

the sale price plus the benefit of financing. One could
argue that the total benefit of selling an animal is reflected in the sale price. The sale price, however, does
not play a pivotal role in the decision to sell when
markets are partially absent: it is not the sale price that
triggers the sale of an animal, but the purpose for which
the sale price received is required. The benefit of selling an animal, Bst , thus reflects the benefit of having
the sale price in hand at the right time.
The expression of the benefits of a single animal into
two indicators parallels the distinction between “production value” and “liquidity value” used by Baker
and Bhargava (1974) in their theory on liquidity management, but in our analysis both terms have a wider
definition.
The total benefit of keeping an animal during n years,
followed by sale, is
n

Bn =

Bnk + Bns .

(10)

t=1

Dividing by n results in the average total benefit per
¯
year, B.
The analysis at herd level is usually carried out for
a period of 1 year. At herd level no separate indicators
for keeping and sale are required, as in an average
situation both apply. The gross margin captures the
total physical production in a year, while the benefits
in insurance and status display and in financing are
measured over the average herd and the proportion

of the herd sold, respectively. The total benefit in an
average year is
B¯ = GM + B¯ s + B¯ f + B¯ p .

(11)

The addition of all income components into one parameter B¯ should not obscure the trade-off among the
components. This trade-off stems from both biophysical and socioeconomic factors. For example, keeping
low-productive animals in the herd on a limited area
reduces overall biological productivity, but increases
the benefits from insurance and status.
The total benefit, either for a single animal or for
a herd, results from the utilization of the household’s
production factors—labor, land, and capital (L, G, and
C, respectively). Allocating the total benefit over the
production factors to determine the respective returns
requires prices for the production factors:
B¯ = (L × pl ) + (G × pg ) + (C × pc ),

(12)

with p l , p g , and p c the prices for labor, land, and capital,
respectively. These prices are either (partly) absent, or
not relevant for all livestock keepers, and this precludes
a general statement on the returns per production factor. However, the formula shows that, given the total
benefit and the amounts of labor, land, and capital used,
there is a trade-off among the returns per production
factor.
Livestock keepers will assess the livestock system in
terms of the types of income derived from keeping and
selling on the one hand, and the household’s production factors used on the other hand (Staal, 2000), and
will do so bearing in mind their possibilities for using
their production factors in other on-farm and off-farm
enterprises; see Fig. 2.
The outcome of this assessment may differ by
household according to their particular objectives and
values for the different income components, their
factor endowments, and their access to institutions.
Analysts lack these individual and subjective references, but the comprehensive appraisal of costs and
benefits presented above offers a framework for combining estimates with observed data. Sensitivity analysis of the estimates allows the analyst to relate the
total benefit of a livestock system to a range of circumstances experienced by different groups of livestock
keepers.

3. An assessment of cattle in Western
Province, Zambia
The method is illustrated by applying it to cattle production in the Western Province of Zambia.
Cattle are kept in combination with crop production
and this combination is widespread in Southern Africa.
The data on the physical production were collected
through herd monitoring over a period of 5 years
(Brouwer et al., 1992; Corten, 1988; van Klink, 1990).
Prices and values were collected and estimated during
an overall assessment of the crop and livestock subsectors (Mwafulirwa and Moll, 1991). The analysis below
refers to an average individual animal, a cow, over a
lifetime of 15 years, the lifetime covered in the herd
monitoring.
Approximately 30% of the households in the Western Province keep cattle. The animals, of the Barotse
type, are kept in herds of 30 to 100 head, owned by
a number of people. During the daytime the animals
graze on natural pasture, under the control of a herdsman. At night they are kept in enclosures, kraals, that
are shifted frequently to spread the manure over the
fields where maize and millet will be grown. Meat production is the main purpose of the system, but cows are
milked (leaving enough milk for the calf), and bullocks
are used for transport and ploughing.
3.1. Resources and production for one cow
Labor is used for herding, shifting kraals, and
for milking. The capital embodied in the animals is
substantial: it forms 90% of the total assets of the
cattle-keeping households (Moll and Dietvorst, 1999).

Minimal amounts of working capital are used to buy
medicines. There is ample scope for more cattle in
the Western Province, so land (natural pasture), is not
scarce and access is free. The resources used and the
production obtained over the lifetime of a cow are
shown in Table 1. On average the reproductive period
of the cow starts in year 4, with some cows giving birth
in year 3 and a larger proportion as late as in year 5;
this distribution is reflected in the table. The average
number of calves per cow is approximately 3.5, with an
average calving interval of 1.6 years. The weight gain
becomes close to zero from year 7 onward.
3.2. Prices, values, and indicators
The prices refer to the average prices during 1990.
The price for milk in the provincial capital, Mongu, was
10 K/liter, but in rural areas the price was substantially
lower, so an average price of 5 K/liter has been used
to value the milk. 1 Most of the milk is consumed by
the household or exchanged in the community, but an
estimated 25% of the milk is sold for cash. Purchased
inputs refer to veterinary drugs and medicines sold by
the Western Province Cooperative Union. There is no
market for manure, so the value of manure has been estimated as the total price of an amount of fertilizer with
equivalent nutrient components. This is a conservative
estimate, as crops on the sandy soils benefit from the
organic matter as well. In a more commercially oriented situation in Kenya, Lekasi et al. (1998) found
that the market value of manure was about five times
1 Kwacha, the currency unit in Zambia; the average rate of exchange in 1990 was K 29 = US$1.

the value of the equivalent nutrients in fertilizer. Productive cows are generally not sold, as a cattle keeper
will exchange such a cow for an ox from another cattle
keeper if cash is required. As a result, no prices were
available for cows in the reproductive phase, and in
this analysis the price of a cow is based on the farm
gate price of 14 K/kg live weight paid for slaughter
animals by iterant traders (Table 2). The net recurrent
cash income from a milked cow is small, around 150 K
(US$5) annually. The recurrent income in kind during
the productive period was equivalent to 31 kg of maize
in year 3, 118 kg in year 5, and to 17 kg from year
11 onward. The annual added value reached 1,063 K
in year 5 and thereafter dwindled to close to 75 K
(US$2.6).
3.3. Benefits in insurance, financing,
and status display
The Zambezi floodplain, where most of the cattle
in Western Province are kept, is marginally suitable
for crop production. In average-to-good years the production of maize and millet might just be sufficient
to meet the household’s consumption requirements,

but in years with below average rainfall, staple food
must be purchased. In these circumstances cattle form
the major insurance against famine, as there is no formal insurance. A factor of 0.05 to 0.10 would reflect
a range of relatively favorable to unfavorable local
circumstances.
Most of the cattle keepers had no access to financial
institutions, and even if they had had access to one of
the two banks in the provincial capital Mongu, a savings account would have been unattractive as interest
rates on savings were negative in real terms due to inflation. In principle, it is possible to store wealth in the
form of maize, but rodents and pests take a heavy toll.
In these circumstances the most attractive option in financing is to keep animals until a substantial amount of
cash is required (Moll and Dietvorst, 1999). A benefit
factor of 0.10 has been taken to reflect the unattractive
potential alternative modes of financing.
Cattle offer a major opportunity to express status
in the rural communities, and people are known for
the size of their herd. A benefit factor of 0.03 has
been taken to value the status aspect. The benefits in
insurance, financing, and status display are shown in
Table 3.

3.4. Analysis

and there is sufficient grazing area for herd expansion.
Cattle keeping is the major economic enterprise for
the majority of the population in the Western Province
and alternative uses for the total capital embodied in
the provincial herd are not present. Neither are financial institutions present that offer a prospect of real
positive interest rates in combination with acceptable
transaction cost. For these reasons the average opportunity costs of capital invested in cattle are set to zero.
The benefits can thus be attributed to the remaining
resource: labor. The return from keeping a cow ranges
from 106 to 222 K/manday from year 3 onward. To this
must be added the benefit obtained when the animal is
sold sometime within the period of 15 years. This return to labor per day is substantially above the return to
labor from crop production, which has been estimated

Having valued the physical production and estimated the benefits in insurance, financing, and status
display, the total benefit of a cow can be expressed in
the two indicators: the benefit derived from keeping
a cow per year; and, the benefit of selling the animal
at the end of the year, Table 4. The benefit derived
from keeping an animal declines after the reproductive
period, but due to the benefits in insurance and status
display it does not become negligible. The mere fact of
having an animal thus results in benefits.
In Table 5 the benefits derived from a cow over its
lifetime are compared with the resources used. The
value of the natural grassland used for cattle can be set
at zero, as there are no alternative types of land use

at 20 K/manday (Mwafulirwa and Moll, 1991). The
major economic enterprises for the rural households
in the Western Province are cattle husbandry and crop
production, and keeping a cow, with a milk production
around 100 liters/year during her reproductive period,
is thus an attractive enterprise. This is due to the combination of physical production and the benefits in terms
of insurance, financing, and status.
The inclusion in the analysis of these intangible
benefits has consequences for the decision to sell an
animal as it affects both the benefit from selling an
animal and the net present value of future production
(Fig. 3). The lines a, b, and c represent the net present
values of future production from the years indicated
until the end of year 15, inclusive of the sale of the
animal at the end of year 15. A discount rate of 0.10
represents the time preference. Because this analysis

is based on average production data, mortality is not
included. Inclusion would not change the analysis as
the salvage value does not deviate substantially from
the live weight value in the Western Province. Line a
depicts a situation in which the benefits in insurance
and status display are not relevant (bs and b p are both
0.00). Line b represents the present value of total future
benefits in a low-risk situation with benefit factors for
insurance and status display of 0.05 and 0.03 respectively. A higher risk situation is depicted by line c with
a benefit factor for insurance of 0.10. The lines d and
e depict the total benefit of selling an animal during
the year, with benefit factors for financing of 0.00 and
0.10, respectively. Lines d and a show a hypothetical
situation with fully functioning markets for insurance,
financing, and status display (benefit factors all 0.00).
The sale of an animal should be considered around

year 6, as the sale price (line d) rises above the present
value of future production (line a). The combination
of line e with lines b and c reflects the situation in the
Western Province. The combination of lines e and b
represents low-risk situation, and the combination of
line e with line c represents the high-risk situation with
sales around year 12. The three combinations show
that with increasing importance of insurance, the moment of sale shifts toward the end of the lifetime of the
animal.
Cows older than 11 years account for only 2% of
the female animals in the Western Province and this
indicates that lines e and c reflect the perspective of
cattle keepers in an extreme situation, with high risk
leading to substantial benefits of cattle in insurance.
Fig. 3 shows that the overall effect of the inclusion
of the benefits for insurance, financing, and status is
that the value of keeping animals increases relative to
the value of selling animals. This finding is in line
with the discussion by Low (1986) on the reasons for
keeping and selling cattle in the context of nonmarket
benefits of cattle ownership in Southern Africa. It also
shows the limitations of herd simulation models that
just focus on the interaction between herd size, herd
composition, and voluntary dispatch.
This analysis of cattle at herd level in the Western
Province would show the existence of herds with older
animals than would be expected on the basis of an optimal physical production. In other situations, where
total fodder availability is the limiting factor, these

older animals compete with animals in the prime of
physical production, the result being a total physical
production below what is theoretically possible from
the available fodder resources. Zemmelink (1995) did
research in such a situation in East Java and compared
total feed resources with the total herd of ruminants.
He found that the total herd was substantially larger
than the optimum size for physical production, and
concluded that this could only be explained by taking
into account the benefits from the insurance function.
In East Java, and under similar circumstances, there
is thus a trade-off between the benefits from physical production and the benefits from insurance, and
status.

4. Discussion and conclusions
The method to analyze livestock systems described
and demonstrated above first enables a number of income indicators to be formulated that capture, quantify,
and organize the various benefits of a livestock system.
Some of the income indicators are based on current
market prices and are largely valid for all livestock
keepers. However, the indicators “income in kind” and
the intangible benefits are related to household characteristics that may differ substantially, such as household composition and access to financial institutions.
The identification of separate income indicators, that
together capture total income, thus allows a focus on

192

H. A. J. Moll / Agricultural Economics 32 (2005) 181–193

different groups of livestock keepers. Second, for the
overall appraisal of the livestock system, the summation of the various income indicators is related to the
costs of the system in terms of the household’s production factors employed, thereby taking into account opportunity costs. Again, livestock keepers usually differ
in factor endowments and the appraisal can accommodate the various options open to different groups.
The relative importance of the indicators will differ
with the livestock systems under analysis and the presence or absence of markets for resources, production,
and services. The cattle production analyzed in Section 3 took place in a situation with almost absent markets for resources and services, a rudimentary market
for milk, and with a functioning market for slaughter
animals. The case reflects an extreme, but not uncommon, situation of restricted access to markets. In more
market-oriented systems, such as dairy production near
urban areas, the importance of the net recurrent cash
income will be more prominent and more visible. However, the linkages with crop production (recurrent income in kind) and the benefits in financing and insurance may still contribute substantially to the total
benefit of the system. Additionally, in more marketoriented livestock systems the household’s production
factors—labor, land and possibly also capital—usually
have alternative opportunities in agricultural and
nonagricultural enterprises that generally have clearly
identifiable types of income. The application of the
comprehensive appraisal of costs and benefits of livestock systems is therefore justified in a wide range of
circumstances.
The inclusion of the markets for resources, production, and services in the analysis of livestock systems
enables researchers and policy makers to assess these
systems more closely from the viewpoint of the livestock keepers. This is highly relevant for the development of effective livestock policies, because livestock
keepers will assess all proposed changes in the production system in the context of their objectives, factor
endowment, and institutional environment.
