Abstract
This paper examines the labor supply of farm households in Nepal using a recently developed methodology that accounts
for the simultaneity between production and consumption decisions of the households. Estimates of marginal products of male
and female labor or shadow wages are obtained from an agricultural production function. An instrumental variable approach
is then used to recover the household's structural labor supply from variations in the shadow wages and income, as well as
other household characteristics. The findings reveal that both male and female total labor supply are sensitive to changes in
shadow wages and income. Human capital embodied in education is found to exert a significant positive effect on output, but
has no statistically significant impact on total labor supply of individuals. The results also rejects the existence of efficient
labor markets in rural Nepal. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
An understanding of the response of the labor supply of farm households to changes in economic opportunities is crucial for the achievement of the dual
goals of income growth and equity in developing countries. Empirical studies providing information on the
determinants of intrafamily allocation of time in productive activities performed by rural households are
particularly important in helping policy makers understand the effects of policies on individual welfare

(Huffman, 1980). In addition, knowledge from such
studies may show insight into the intermediary role of
the family between public policies and the welfare of
family members (Rosenzweig, 1986). More recently,
Heckman (1993) argued that empirical evidence on
individuals' labor supply decisions constitutes an important part of the understanding of aggregate labor
supply. Considerable effort has therefore been devoted
to the analysis of time allocation behavior of rural
households in developing countries.
Most of the empirical literature dealing with time
allocation of farm households in developing countries
are based on the assumption of independence between
farm household production and consumption decisions
(e.g., Barnum and Squire, 1979; Rosenzweig, 1980;

Ahn et al., 1981). Under this assumption, the farm
household acts as if it seeks to maximize profits from
its production activities, subject to production constraints. The resulting farm profits then form part of its
full income constraint, subject to which the household
is assumed to maximize its utility from consumption.
This approach is justifiable algebraically under certain assumptions. The prominent assumptions made
are that rural labor markets are efficient and free of
transaction costs, and that family and hired labor are
perfect substitutes.
While this separability assumption provides analytical advantages for empirical analysis, its shortcomings have been clearly documented in the economic
literature. Benjamin (1992) points out that market imperfections that results in hiring-in or off-farm employment constraints, or even differing efficiencies of
family and hired labor are all major sources of interdependence of production and consumption decisions.
Lopez (1984) also argues that farmers may have preferences towards working on or off the farm. The separability assumption generally breaks down under any
of these conditions. For example, if there are no labor
markets, the household must equate its labor demand
and supply according to a virtual or shadow wage determined by all the variables that influence household
decision making (Singh et al., 1986).
Given that rural institutions that pertain to the linkage of factor markets and tenancy rights in developing
countries inhibit the working of competitive markets
for inputs and output, labor allocation is likely to be
determined by shadow wages rather than actual market
wages. Recent empirical evidence also call into question the validity of the perfect substitutability offamily
and hired labor assumption for developing countries
(e.g., Deolalikar and Vijverberg, 1987).
The purpose of this paper is to examine the labor
supply responses of males and females of farm households in Nepal to changes in economic opportunities by applying a methodology developed by Jacoby
(1993). For policy purposes it is more useful to examine the factors influencing the labor supply responses
of males and females separately rather than to note
the simple presence of each gender in the household.
By following Jacoby's approach, which permits the
analysis of peasant family labor supply behavior under
the alternative assumption of nonseparability, the restrictive assumptions of separability can be eliminated.

Nonseparability between production and consumption
decisions implies that a change in any of the exogenous variables affecting the production choices of the
household - such as changes in the prices of inputs
and outputs - will influence the labor supply choices
of the household, both directly and indirectly (Singh
et al., 1986). While the direct effects occur through
changes in the household's shadow profits, the indirect
effects tend to occur through the resulting changes in
the shadow wages of family labor.
The paper is laid out as follows. After presenting
the theoretical framework in Section 2, Section 3 describes the data used in the study. Empirical results are
contained in Section 4 and the paper concludes with
a summary section outlining the main findings of this
paper.

2. Economic model
The theoretical basis for the model presented below draws on the agricultural household model developed in Jacoby (1993) and Skoufias (1994). The
model considers a two person household in which both
males and females jointly choose the consumption of
home produced goods (Q), market goods (G), their respective allocation of time (T) between market work
(Mi), own-farm work (Fi), home production (Si), and
leisure (L; ), as well as the inputs of male and female
hired labor (H;) into own-farm production, where i indexes males (1) and females (2). Time spent on market
work yields wage income that allows the household
to purchase the market goods (G). The time allocated
to home production involves activities such as child
care and meal preparation. The effective real wage
earned from off-farm work (W;) is assumed constant.
It is further assumed that the number of children in
the household as well as demographic composition of
the adult members of the households are exogenous.
Given these specifications the household is assumed
to maximize
(1)

where U is household utility function, which is assumed to be strictly concave, and to possess second
partial derivatives. The vector Z parameterizes the utility function and summarizes household characteristics, such as the number of people in each age and sex

A. Abdulai, P.P. RegmilAgricultural Economics 22 (2000) 309-320

category. As in Jacoby (1993), C is total household
consumption, which is the sum of home produced (Q)
and market purchased goods (G).
The maximization of U is bound by the budget constraint:

G= Y

+ W1M1 + WzMz- WfHI- WfHz + V(2)

where wi and wr are the wages of family and
hired labor, respectively, and V is household nonfarm nonlabor income net of any fixed costs associated with farm-household production; the strictly
concave agricultural production function, Y =
Y (FI, Fz, H1, Hz; E), where Eisa vector of fixed inputs (e.g., land) and Y is farm output. The price of the
composite consumption good is normalized to unity
and set equal to the price of farm output; the strictly
concave home production function, Q=Q(S 1, Sz; A),
where A is a vector of fixed inputs. The agricultural
commodity that is either produced by the household
or purchased from the market is assumed to be perfectly substitutable with the home produced commodity. The following non-negativity constraints are also
assumed to be binding: Si 2:0, Mi 2:0, Fi 2:0, Hi 2:0.
In addition, all individuals are assumed to work in at
least one sector (Li < Ti).
The first-order conditions for this problem state that
each household member equates their marginal rate
of substitution between consumption and leisure, or
shadow wage, either to their market wage or to their
marginal product in either farm work or housework.
The decision of some family members not to participate in the labor market results in a budget constraint
that is non-linear in hours worked. However, Jacoby
(1993) shows that the gradient of the budget constraint
is the shadow wage vector CWi) at the optimum, where
Wi = YL;, at which point the constraint is linear. This
requires redefining the full income of the household
as:
A

*A

h

A

h

*A

A

V = Il (WJ, Wz, W1 , Wz; A)+ \II (WI, Wz; E)
+W1T + WzT

where W1 and Wz represent the shadow values of
male and female time, respectively. Eq. (3) implies that
household 'shadow full income' CV) is composed of
'shadow farm profit', (Il*) with the opportunity cost
of family labor properly deducted and the 'profit' from
housework (\11*). The household full income constraint
evaluated at the optimum is then given as:

G + Q+ WILI

+ WzLz = V +WIT+ WzT

(4)

where the expression on the left-hand side is the
value of total household expenditures on goods and
leisure and the expression on the right-hand side is
the 'shadow full income'. Q denotes the amount of
the home produced commodity at the optimum
Maximization of Eq. (1) subject to Eq. (4) yields the
same first-order conditions as discussed earlier. Solving this revised utility maximization problem yields a
set of structural household leisure demand functions:

si.

(5)
Given that the shadow wages are the prices of pure
leisure in Eq. (5), labor supply can be defined as total
hours in productive activities, as opposed to market
hours alone as found in traditional labor supply models using observed wages (e.g. Huffman, 1980; Rosenzweig, 1980). Denoting Pt as the total hours of work
of farnil y males and females in market work, farm production, and hours used in producing the home good,
the structural labor supply functions can be written as:

(6)

s;

where Pt = T- L7 =
+ Ft + M(, if Mt > 0, and
Pt = T-L7 = S7+Ft, if Mt = 0. Male and female
labor supply will generally depend on both shadow
wages, since men and women are not necessarily perfect substitutes in production, and separability on the
preference side is not imposed.

period between May 1996 and April 1997. Eight
villages were selected to represent the three broad
agroclimatic zones of the country. A stratified random
sample of a total of 35 households was selected in
each of the eight villages to ensure representation of
all categories of households. The three zones include
the Terai, the Hilly, and the Mountainous zones. The
Terai zone which represents the low flat lands of the
southern part of the country is very suitable for cereal
and vegetable production. The Hilly zone is located
in the central part with a climate that ranges between
subtropical to temperate. The area is considered very
good for fruit production, with cereals and livestock
production largely practiced. The Mountainous area,
in the northern part of the country, has a climate that
is mostly suitable for livestock production and temperate fruits, although cereals and potatoes are also
cultivated in the area. Mechanization is often difficult
on the steep mountain slopes, and households tend
to diversify their production activities by cultivating
different crops.
The survey collected detailed information on farm
and non-farm activities, as well as demographic and

location characteristics. Detailed time allocation information for each household member was collected
on a fortnightly basis. Thus, males and females family
labor allocated to farm and non-farm activities were
fully recorded. Hired labor, differentiated by sex was
also included.
Table 1 summarizes the key characteristics of the
households. The input of land is measured as amount
of land actually used by the household in the year
of the survey. Since most households in the sample cultivate more than one crop and also raise livestock, and data on input use is not available, the approach by Huffman (1976) is followed by aggregating different outputs using prices. The total value of
output is computed as the sum of the value of all
crops harvested, the sales of animal products and some
fraction of the value of the household's herd. 1 The
value of each crop is estimated using village level median prices of the prices that farmers indicate their
crops would currently fetch on the market. This avoids

the problem of using the same set of prices for all
farms. 2
For the variable physical inputs such as fertilizer,
insecticides, seeds, and transportation, the only available data are levels of expenditure. Using such data in
place of quantities in the production function can lead
to biased estimates if input price variation is substantial. Including the expenditure levels of these inputs
is, however, preferable to ignoring them altogether
and suffering an omitted variables problem (Jacoby,
1992). The value of farm equipment (mainly animal
ploughs), a dummy variable for whether or not perennial crops are grown, and a set of location dummies
for Terai, Hilly and Mountainous zones of Nepal are
also included as explanatory variables.
Given that better education improves management
and may raise technical and allocative efficiency of
the individual, education represented by the number of
years of schooling is used as an indicator of the potential productivity of the individual. The average head
spent about 3 years in school. Female members of the
household have a much lower education than males.
38% of males have no education, vs. 64% for females.
Age is used as a measure of experience. The use of
hired labor is quite low, accounting on average for as
little as 7.9% of total labor used in farm production.

4. The empirical estimation
On condition that both household members work
on the family farm, estimation of the labor supply
functions (6) can be done by substituting the marginal
product of family farm labor for the corresponding
shadow wage, and by replacing full income with farm
profits. As pointed out by Jacoby (1993), if the sample contains part time workers, the market wage could
be employed in place of the marginal product of labor on the farm, provided working off the farm entails no transaction cost. The estimation in the present
study proceeds in two steps. Estimates of marginal
2 As argued by Bardhan (1979), if farmers face the same prices
and the true production possibility frontier is concave, rather than
linear, crop composition cannot be allowed to vary across farms,
since farmers are assumed to have the same technology. However,
if crop composition is variable in the sample, movements along a
given production possibility frontier will be construed as shifts in
the value of output.

313

productivity of family male and female labor are first
obtained through a production function analysis. The
estimated shadow wages and income are then used in
the second stage to estimate the male and female labor
supply functions. 3
4.1. Estimation of the production function

The Cobb-Douglas functional form is used to fit
the production function. Despite its well known limitations, the Cobb-Douglas form is used because preliminary analysis with more flexible functional forms
such as the translog, yielded results that were inconclusive. Specifically, most of the coefficients of the interaction terms were not statistically significant, while
some of the coefficients turned out to be negative, contrary to a priori expectations. 4 The advantage of the
Cobb-Douglas form is its ease of estimation and interpretation. The coefficient of an input in the function
represents the production elasticity of that input. The
production function is specified as:
n

In Yi

m

= L_)~J In Xij + LYkDik + &'i
}=1

(7)

k=l

where Yi represents the total value of agricultural output produced by farm household i, Xij is a vector denoting the quantity of input j used by farmer i, D K
is a vector of location dummies that represent some
location-specific characteristics, such as topology and
temperature, which affect output but are not observable to an econometrician; a J and 'Yk are parameters,
and &'i is an error term summarizing the effects of
omitted variables. The inputs included in the vector
Xj include cropped area, value of seed, value of fertilizer, value of insecticide, expenditure on transporta3 As stated in Lopez (1984), if the production and labor suppi y disturbance are correlated, then greater efficiency might be
achieved by employing a full-information estimation method. Jacoby (1993), however, points out that even if the production function and the labor supply functions are linear in their parameters,
the later functions will generally not be linear in the parameters, presenting computational difficulties. The approach of Jacoby
(1993) and McCurdy and Pencavel (1986) is therefore followed
in this study.
4 Jacoby's (Jacoby, 1993) study showed that while the quantitative results may be sensitive to the functional form of the agricultural production function, the qualitative results do not change
much.

314

tion, hours of hired male labor, hours of hired female
labor, hours of family male labor, hours of family female labor, hours of child labor (family and hired),
hours of draft animals services and livestock inputs
(mainly medicine and feed).
The age and level of education of household head
are also included as proxies for the management input.
This is done under the assumption that the household
head, whether male or female, is also the primary decision maker on the family farm. In the regression, all
the independent variables except for the dummies are
in logarithmic form. Given the presence of zero values
in most of the variable inputs, the logarithmic transformation was carried out by adding one to all the inputs,
except land and adult male and female labor which
are always positive by construction of the sample.
Table 2 reports OLS estimates of the coefficients of
the production function. The results indicate that most
of the inputs have significantly positive effects on agricultural output. Land appears to be an important input
in the production process. With the notable exception
of child labor, all the variables representing labor are
significantly different from zero. The coefficients for
the labor variables show that the use of family labor
has a greater impact on agricultural output than the
use of hired labor, supporting the hypothesis that family members have stronger work incentives compared
to hired labor. Quite striking is the fact that family
male labor has a greater impact on output than family
female labor. This result is in contrast to the findings
reported by Skoufias (1994) who finds that family female labor has a greater impact on output than family male labor in India. The result here is probably
due to the fact that the activities such as ploughing,
which are undertaken by men, contribute more at the
margin to output than activities such as weeding and
transplanting in which females are largely engaged in
Nepal. The head's schooling also has a positive and
significant impact on agricultural output, confirming
the widely accepted role of human capital toward improving farmers' efficiency (Abdulai and Huffman,
1999). The choice of livestock appreciation rate does
not seem to influence the estimated marginal products
of male and female labor. 5
5

When the rate is set at 0.2 or 0.3, instead of 0.25, the resulting
marginal products are perfectly correlated with those derived from
the estimates reported in Table 2.

Given that the physical inputs themselves are
likely to be endogenous variables, the estimates
from OLS could be biased. Hence, instrumental variable technique (IV) is also applied to estimate the
Cobb-Douglas production function. The second column in Table 2 presents the instrumental variable
estimates. The variables used as identifying instruments in the estimation are indicated at the bottom
of Table 2. The value of the Wu-Hausman statistic
given in Table 2 suggests that the instruments can be
considered exogenous in the estimation. Following
Jacoby (1993), the shadow wage rates (or marginal
products) of family male and female labor hours are
calculated from the instrumental variable estimates of
the Cobb-Douglas production presented in Table 2,
using the formula: 6

respectively; FERTV, INSV, and SEEDY are expenditures on fertilizer, insecticide, and seeds, respectively.

The labor supply of males and females are fitted
separately to data for the farm households used in the
previous analysis. Analysis is focused on impacts of
wages, income and other exogenous variables on the

preferable to OLS estimates, since the assumption of exogenous
inputs in the production function contradicts implications of the
agricultural household model.

total hours worked by males and females. Since all
households reported positive hours for male and female farm labor, the entire sample is used. For each
household, the male and female labor supply variables
are computed as the average number of hours per day
spent in farm work, off-farm self-employment, wage
employment and housework by males and females in
the household, respectively. Time spent on social ceremonies, religious activities, and other pure consumption activities, such as eating or sleeping are considered as leisure. All females in the sample reported
positive hours for farm work and domestic activities,
while all males reported positive hours for farm work,
with some reporting positive hours for domestic activities. The average daily hours in non-leisure activities (total hours worked) are 8.5 for males and 10.0

for females, indicating that women spend more time
in working than men.

sition variables, etc. affecting taste towards work, a's

summarizing the effects of unobserved factors. 7 As
in the production function analysis, age and education are measured in years. Including age in quadratic
form allows estimation of life cycle effects. Number
of adult males and females, as well as children in
the household are also included. The rationale for
including children is that women with children of
pre-school or primary school age are less likely to
have time to engage in market activities.
The coefficients a13 and a23 provide estimates of
the income elasticities of male and female labor, respectively. If leisure is a normal good, higher levels
of income would result in fewer hours of work. Previous studies generally support this hypothesis although
estimates have been inelastic (Jacoby, 1993; Skoufias,
1994). The estimated coefficients au and azz represent the uncompensated own-wage elasticities for
males and females, respectively, while a12 and a21
provide estimates of the uncompensated cross-wage
elasticities.
To obtain consistent estimates, the labor supply
functions are estimated using instrumental variable
procedure. In the first-stage, the shadow wage rates
and shadow income are regressed on variables of
household composition such as the number of children less than or equal to 14 years, and the number
of males and females greater than or equal to 15
years and less than 60 years, individual characteristics
such as age and age squared, and number of years
of schooling; zonal dummies, value of buildings,
land and farm implements owned by the household,
and all the instruments that are given in Table 2.
The predicted values from these regressions are then
used in the second stage to estimate the labor supply
functions employing ordinary least squares.
Estimating the labor supply functions with the predicted values requires deleting some variables that are
used in the first stage regression to allow for identification of the models. Household assets such as land and
value of buildings, village level wage rates, and the
interaction variables were deleted from the labor sup-

ply functions, thus serving as identifying instruments.
The Wald test statistics Cxr0) for the joint significance
of these variables in the shadow wage equations are
20.06 and 24.28 for males and females, respectively,
against the critical value of x{io,O.OS) = 18.31. The
corresponding figure for the shadow income equation
is 23.19, also against a critical value of Xfw,o.OS) =
18.31. The joint significance of these variables in the
first stage regressions suggests that the instruments do
enter the first stage estimation and are therefore appropriate instruments (Staiger and Stock, 1997).
Table 3 presents the parameter estimates of
the male and female labor supply functions. The
Breusch-Pagan test was employed to test for potential heteroskedasticity that may be induced by
the two-stage procedure of using estimated shadow
wages and income as well as heteroskedasticity possibly present across households. The computed xr3
values of 23.45 and 24.53 for males and females, respectively, are above the critical value of 22.4 at the
5% level, suggesting the presence of heteroskedasticity. In order to account for the heteroskedasticity,
the t-statistics reported are calculated from White's
(White, 1980) formula that accounts for nonparametric forms of heteroskedasticity. The values of the
Wu-Hausman statistics given in the Table suggest
that the instruments can be considered exogenous
in the labor supply functions. The joint hypotheses
that all non-intercept coefficients in the labor supply
models are zero are tested with Wald statistics. The
sample values of the Wald statistics 8 are 27.79 and
26.82 for the male and female labor supply functions,
respectively, with a critical value of xr3,0.05 = 22.4,
thus rejecting the null hypotheses.
Consistent with Jacoby's findings, the estimates of
uncompensated own-wage effects are significant and
positive for both males and females, suggesting an
upward sloping labor supply. The findings, however,
contrast with backward bending market labor supply
functions reported by Skoufias (1994) for Indian females and Rosenzweig (1980) for Indian males. Moreover, the own-wage elasticities are slightly higher for
men than for women. Given that the definition of

7 It is significant to mention that the estimated shadow income
and marginal products of family male and female labor are household specific and as such take on the same value for different
members of the household of the same gender.

8 In carrying out tests of statistical significance using White
(1980) standard errors, Wald statistics must be employed in preference to F-tests. This follows from the fact that the later relies
on the assumption of homoscedastic errors (Greene, 1997).

labor supply used in this study includes housework, a
greater response by females to changes in their shadow
wage should not be expected a priori (Jacoby, 1993).
Both point estimates of shadow income are significant
and negative for males and females, indicating that
both male and female leisure are normal goods. The
income elasticities are greater for men than women,
a finding that is in line with the results obtained by
Skoufias (1994) for India, but contrasts with that of
Jacoby (1993) for Peru.
The cross male wage effect on the market labor supply of females is negative and significant, indicating
that female labor supply is sensitive to movements in
the male wage. This is consistent with family utility
maximization and indicates that studies that restrict
such cross-wage effects to be zero may result in specification errors.
The age variable represents a combination of experience and life-cycle effects on labor supply. The coefficients suggest that more experience initially tends
to increase the market labor supply of individuals, although at a decreasing rate. The labor supply of males

and females begin to decrease after the ages of 39.1
and 35.9, respectively. There is no effect of the number of years of schooling on the labor market decisions
of households, indicating that the main impact of education on male and female labor supply is indirect
through farm profitability and marginal productivity
of male and female time in farm production. The number of children appears to have no significant impact
on the market labor supply of males and females in
Nepal, a result that is consistent with findings based
on data from other developing countries (Rosenzweig,
1980; Abdulai and Delgado, 1999). The presence of
other men and women in the household of working
age tends to increase the market labor supply of men.
However, the variable representing the number of men
of working age in the household has a negative, although statistically insignificant effect in the women's
labor supply equation.
To check whether the estimates under the nonseparability assumption differ from the usual separability
assumption, the male and female labor supply functions are re-estimated using the average market wages

(W;) in place of the shadow wages (W;), and non-labor
income in place of the shadow income ('.'\ ). These
results are reported in Table 4. It can be observed
that the estimates obtained using market wages differ
from those with shadow wages discussed above. In
particular, the coefficients for the wage and income
variables are much higher, while the own-wage effects
are negative for males and females, suggesting that
assumptions about separability are crucial in labor
supply estimations (Skoufias, 1994).
4.3. Examining the equality of market wage and
marginal productivity
In order to gain further insights into the efficient
functioning of labor markets in rural Nepal, the hypothesis of equality between marginal products of labor and the market wages is tested in this section. This
is done by using the sub-samples of males and females
who report working mostly for wages during the survey period. Approximately 39% of males and 34% of
females in the sample fall in this category. Under the
assumption that households maximize utility, the effective wage received by family members participating in the non-farm labor market should be equal to

the marginal productivity of work on the family farm.
Further assuming that working off the farm entails no
transaction cost, the effective wage reported should be
equal to the market wage. As in Jacoby (1993), the
following regression is estimated to verify the equality
of marginal productivity and wage rate
(11)
where W; is the estimated shadow wage of male and
female labor, W; is the wage received by working in
the market, and v; is a random term probably including
measurement error.
As indicated above, utility maximization and efficiency of the labor market imply that a=O, and b= 1.
This means that the allocation of time between farm
and market is made purely on efficiency grounds by
individuals in the sub-sample. The theory also implies
that v; is independent of the taste for work. In addition
to the OLS estimates, instrumental variable estimation
is also carried out to account for potential measurement errors in the wage rates.
Table 5 reports the estimates of Eq. (11). The
F-statistics from the OLS and instrumental variable
estimations presented in the Table 5 show that the
null hypothesis of equality between the marginal

product and wage rates can be rejected for both males
and females. This finding is in line with the earlier results reported by Jacoby (1993) and Skoufias
(1994). The presence of transaction costs or other
imperfections such as commuting cost or disutility
associated with working off the farm, or employment
constraints in the labor market, could be responsible
for the inequality between the marginal product and
the market wage. It is, however, noteworthy that even
under these circumstances, the marginal product and
the shadow wage would still be equal (Jacoby, 1993).
The findings here indirectly lend some support to
the concern about interdependence of production and
consumption decisions of farm households (Table 5).

5. Concluding remarks
Farm households in developing countries often face
partly absent labor markets or institutionally imposed
constraints. Under such conditions, households tend
to face a shadow wage that depends on both production technology and household preferences. Hence, it
is significant to examine how their labor supply is affected by changes in their shadow wages and income.
This paper applied a model that permits the estimation of the labor supply of farm household members
under the assumption of nonseparability between production and consumption decisions of households to
a sample of 280 Nepalese farm households. Estimates
of the marginal productivities of family male and female labor were derived from an agricultural production function. In a second stage, the estimated shadow
wages and income were then used to examine the

319

response of individual time of work to changes in the
economic conditions facing the household.
Evidence was found to support the behavioral
assumption that farm households allocate their
members' time as if to maximize a family utility
function. The male and female labor supply function
estimates appeared similar in many respects to econometric labor supply findings based on other developing country data sets. Specifically, the total hours
of male and female work were found to be sensitive
to changes in the shadow wages and income. An increase in the wage rate of a family member tends to
have a negative impact on the market labor supply of
other family members. These cross wage effects on
the labor supply of family members provide evidence
on the significant role of the family as an intermediary
between public policies and individual welfare.
The results also were consistent with the hypothesis
that schooling enhances agricultural productivity in
Nepal. In contrast to several studies on labor supply
of farm households in developing countries, schooling did not seem to have a direct effect on either male
or female total hours of work. This suggests that the
main impact of schooling on male and female market labor supply is indirect through farm profitability
and marginal productivity of male and female time in
farm production. Furthermore, the analysis provides
evidence against the perfect factor market hypothesis.
A finding that is in line with much of the development
literature in which inefficient markets are regarded
as part of the economic landscape in developing
econonnes.
The methodology employed here provides further
information on the usefulness of shadow wages in estimating time allocation models, particularly where
wage data are not available, or the conditions required
to make use of available wage data are not in place.
This information is essential to establish distributional
impacts of changing economic conditions on farm
household welfare.
