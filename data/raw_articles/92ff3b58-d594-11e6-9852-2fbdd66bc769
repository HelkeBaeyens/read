Abstract
This paper contributes to the productivity literature in developing country agriculture by quantifying the level of
efficiency for a sample of peasant farmers from Eastern Paraguay. A stochastic efficiency decomposition methodology is used to derive technical, allocative and economic efficiency measures separately for cotton and cassava. An
average economic efficiency of 40.1% for cotton and of 52.3% for cassava is found, which suggests considerable
room for productivity gains for the farms in the sample through better use of available resources given the state of
technology. Gains in output through productivity growth have become increasingly important to Paraguay as the
opportunities to bring additional virgin lands into cultivation have significantly diminished in recent years. No clear
strategy to improve farm productivity could be gleaned from an examination of the relationship between efficiency
and various socioeconomic variables. One possible explanation for this finding is the existence of a stage of
development threshold below which there is no consistent relationship between socioeconomic variables and
productivity. If this is the case, then our results suggest that this sample of Paraguayan peasants are yet to reach such
a threshold. Hence, improvements in educational and extension services, for example, would be needed to go beyond
this threshold. Once this is accomplished, additional productivity gains would be obtained by further investments in
human capital and related factors.

prise, therefore, that considerable effort has been
devoted to the analysis of farm level efficiency in
developing countries. An underlying premise behind much of this work is that if farmers are not
making efficient use of existing technology, then
efforts designed to improve efficiency would be
more cost-effective than introducing new technologies as a means of increasing agricultural
output (Belbase and Grabowski, 1985; Shapiro,
1983).
Most of the empirical literature dealing with
farm efficiency in developing countries has been
concerned exclusively with the measurement of
technical efficiency. Studies of this type have
been published for India, The Philippines, Sri
Lanka, Nepal, Malaysia, Tanzania, Jamaica,
Guatemala, and Brazil (Huang and Bagi, 1984;
Kalirajan and Shand, 1985; Kalirajan, 1981, 1984;
Lingard, Castillo and Jayasuriya, 1983; Kalirajan
and Flinn, 1983; Ekayanake, 1987; Kalirajan and
Shand, 1986; Shapiro and Muller, 1977; Rawlins,
1985; Phillips and Marble, 1986; Taylor and
Shonkwiler, 1986). By focusing only on technical
efficiency, these works have ignored the gains in
output that could be obtained in the short run by
also improving allocative efficiency.
There are only a few studies that go beyond
the measurement of technical efficiency in developing country agriculture. These include the work
by Taylor, Drummond and Gomes (1986), who
analyzed technical and economic efficiency for a
sample of Brazilian farmers; Bailey et al. (1989),
who measured technical, allocative and scale inefficiency for a sample of Ecuadorean milk producers; and Ali and Chaudry (1990), who examined technical, allocative and economic efficiency
for a sample of Pakistani crop farmers.
The purpose of this paper is to contribute to
the efficiency literature in developing country
agriculture by quantifying the level of technical,
allocative and economic efficiency for a sample of
peasant farmers from Eastern Paraguay. The relationship between efficiency and various socioeconomic characteristics of the peasants is also
investigated. The remainder of this paper is organized into five sections. First, we present a brief
background of the Paraguayan agricultural sector,
followed by the analytical framework employed in

this study. The data and empirical model are
discussed next, followed by a section containing
the results and analysis. The last section offers
some concluding remarks.

2. Background

The agricultural sector in Paraguay, as is often
the case in less developed nations, has played a
key role in this country's development strategy.
An important component of this strategy was the
availability of public lands which were distributed
to settlers as a means of both absorbing a growing
population and of increasing agricultural output
(Nagel, 1991). These settlements, along with massive migration to Argentina during the 1950s and
1960s, delayed the process of rural to urban migration and eased the need for improving agricultural productivity (Nikiphoroff and Villagra,
1987).
In the late 1960s and through the 1970s,
Paraguay experienced rapid economic growth resulting in part from favorable international commodity prices and, more importantly, from cash
inflows stemming from the huge hydro-electric
project in Itaipu (Evenson, 1988). According to
the World Bank, the average annual rate of
growth in Paraguayan agriculture during the
1965-80 period was a healthy 4.9%. By the late
1970s, however, the availability of public lands for
agricultural use had diminished considerably, and
the vast resources generated during the construction of the Itaipu project had failed to provide a
lasting solution to the rising levels of unemployment and poverty (Nikiphoroff and Villagra,
1987).
In the early 1980s, Paraguay entered a severe
recession resulting in a negative one-percent
growth in the gross national product (GNP). The
annual average GNP growth rate between 1981
and 1986 was a meager 0.6% (BID, 1987). During
this same period, the rate of growth in agriculture
remained positive but dropped to an annual average of 2.0%. By comparison, the average annual
population growth rates went from 2.8% in the
1965-80 period to 3.2% during the 1980-87 period (World Bank, 1989). This poor economic

B.E. Brauo-Ureta, R.E. Evenson/ Agricultural Economics 10 (1994) 27-37

performance, along with rapid population expansion and the dwindling supply of public lands
suitable for cultivation, has made farm productivity growth a major policy issue in Paraguay
(Nikiphoroff and Villagra, 1987).

These three cost measures are the basis for computing the following technical (TE) and economic

EE = (

We begin by assuming that the farm frontier
production function can be written as:

(1)
where Q is the quantity of agricultural output, xa
is a vector of input quantities, and {3 is a vector
of parameters. The technically efficient input vector XP for a given level of production (Q), is
derived by solving simultaneously Eq. (1) and the
input ratios XII Xi= ki (i > 1), where ki is the
ratio of observed inputs xl and xi at output Q.
If the functional form of the production frontier is self-dual, for example Cobb- Douglas, then
the corresponding cost frontier can be derived
analytically and written in general form as:
C=h(P,Q;y)

(2)

where C is the minimum cost associated with the
production of Q, P is a vector of input prices,
and y is a vector of parameters. By using Shephard's Lemma, we obtain:

ac

-

api

=Xi(P, Q; ¢)

(3)

which is a system of minimum cost input demand
equations. Substituting a firm's input prices and
output quantity into the demand system in Eq. (3)
yields the economically efficient input vector xe.
Given a farm's observed level of output, the corresponding technically and economically efficient
costs of production are equal to X/ · P and to
P, respectively, while the cost of the farm's

Following Farrell (1957), Eqs. (4) and (5) can be
combined to obtain the allocative efficiency (AE)
index:
AE

To empirically measure efficiency, we first estimate a stochastic production frontier and then
use the approach introduced by Jondrow et al.
(1982) to separate the deviations from the frontier into a random and an efficiency component.
To show how this separation is accomplished,
consider the stochastic production frontier:

(7)
where

E=v-u

(8)

is the composed error term (Aigner, Lovell and
Schmidt, 1977; Meeusen and van den Broeck,
1977). The two components v and u are assumed
to be independent of each other, where v is the
two-sided, normally distributed random error (v
~ N(O, a}), and u is the one-sided efficiency
component with a half-normal distribution (u ~
I N(O, a} I). The maximum likelihood estimation
of Eq. (7) yields estimators for {3 and A, where {3
was defined earlier, A=(}',,/(}'" and (}' 2 = (}'} + (}'}.
Jondrow et al. (1982) have shown that the
assumptions made on the statistical distributions
of v and u, mentioned above, make it possible to
calculate the conditional mean of u1 given Ei as:

E(u

1 The model presented in this section is based on the stochastic efficiency decomposition approach presented by BravoUreta and Rieger (1991), which is an extension of the model
introduced by Kopp and Diewert (1982). For reviews of frontier function methodology, see Forsund, Lovell and Schmidt
(1980) and Schmidt (1985-86).

where F * and f * are, respectively, the standard
normal density and distribution functions, evaluated at EJAI(J', and (}' 2 = (}'} (}'} 1(}' 2 • Therefore,
Eqs. (7) and (9) provide estimates for u and v
after replacing E, (J', and A by their estimates. If

u is now subtracted from both sides of (7), we
obtain:
Q * = f( X a; {3) - u = Q - u

(10)

where Q * is the firm's observed output adjusted
for the statistical noise captured by u. Eq. (10) is
the basis for computing the vector X 1 and for
algebraically deriving the cost frontier. Applying
Shephard's Lemma to the cost frontier yields the
minimum cost factor demand equations which, in
turn, are used to obtain the vector Xe.
In closing this section, it is useful to point out
that an important issue in stochastic frontier
models is the distributional assumptions made for
the one-sided error. Much of the literature to
date, including this paper, has followed the halfnormal distribution, as originally proposed by
Aigner, Lovell and Schmidt (1977), despite the
fact that more flexible distributions are available.
One of the few papers that have examined the
sensitivity of the efficiency results to distributional assumptions was published recently by
Greene (1990), where he introduced a stochastic
frontier specification that incorporates the
Gamma distribution. After comparing several
specifications, Greene (1990) concluded that, for
his data, efficiency levels were essentially the
same for the half-normal, truncated normal and
exponential distributions while the Gamma model
yielded higher efficiency 2 . In a review of new
developments in frontier function methodology,
Bauer (1990) argued that additional empirical as
well as theoretical work is needed to arrive at a
better understanding of the effects that alternative distributional assumptions have on efficiency.

peasant farms producing traditional food crops
and cotton in Eastern Paraguay. The farms in the
sample are located in the following eight districts:
Caaguazu, Yhu, Eusebio, Ayala, Yaguar6n, Pirayu, Villeta, and Ita 3 .
The analysis reported below focuses on the
two most important crops grown in the study
region, cotton and cassava, for which the data are
most reliable. After deleting farmers not producing these crops and discarding incomplete records,
we end up with 87 cotton producers and 101
cassava producers. A total of 57 farmers produced both crops. This latter group is referred to
as the subsample.
The Cobb-Douglas functional form was used
to fit separate stochastic production frontiers for
cotton and cassava using maximum likelihood
procedures. Despite its well known limitations,
the Cobb-Douglas is chosen because the
methodology employed requires that the production function be self-dual. It is also worth stating
that this functional form has been widely used in
farm efficiency analyses for both developing and
developed countries 4 . Furthermore, in one of
the very few studies examining the impact of
functional form on efficiency, Kopp and Smith
(1980) concluded " ... that functional specification has a discernible but rather small impact on
estimated efficiency" (p. 1058).
The use of the single-equation model depicted
in Eq. (11) is justified by assuming that farmers
maximize expected profits, as is commonly done
in studies of this type (Zellner, Kmenta and
Dreze, 1966; Kopp and Smith, 1980; Caves and
Barton, 1990). The specific model estimated is:
In Y

It should be noted that several years ago Greene (1980)
introduced the Gamma distribution in the context of a deterministic frontier model.

where Y is annual total farm output of cotton or
cassava (kg); R the area devoted to cotton or
cassava production (ha); L family and hired

4 Support for this statement can be found in the reviews of
the empirical literature recently completed by Battese (1992)
and by Bravo-Ureta and Pinheiro (1992).

composed error term defined earlier. The explanatory variables included in the model are
similar to those used in previous studies of developing country agriculture (Taylor, Drummond and
Gomes, 1986; Taylor and Shonkwiler, 1986). A
major difference is that we estimate separate
production frontiers for two individual crops while
most studies rely on estimates of total value product frontiers 5 •

The production functions were initially estimated including
District dummy variables to account for possible effects of
location on the production structure of the farms in the
sample. The null hypothesis that the parameters for the set of
dummy variables was equal to zero could not be rejected for
neither crop for both the OLS and the frontier models.
Consequently, and as a way to simplify the analysis, the
district dummy variables were dropped from the models.

Table 1 shows the maximum likelihood parameter estimates of the stochastic production frontier (Eq. 11) for cotton and cassava producers
along with some descriptive statistics for the sample. For comparison, OLS estimates of average
production functions are also shown. In general,
the frontier estimates amount to a neutral upward shift of the average function. The function
coefficient for cotton is close to 0.90 while the
value for cassava is 1.13. These values are virtually unaffected by the estimator used. Based on
restricted least squares regression, the hypothesis
of constant returns to size cannot be rejected for
either cotton or cassava. These results are consistent with the fact that all farms in the sample are
relatively small. The largest number of hectares
devoted to cotton production is six while the
corresponding figure for cassava is three.

hypothesis that the mean efficiency (EE, TE and
AE) for both crops is equal, evaluated using t-tests,
is accepted for TE and rejected for EE and AE.
These findings are consistent for the overall sample as well as for the subsample of 57 farmers
producing both crops. Therefore, we conclude
that EE and AE are significantly higher in cassava
production compared to cotton production, while
no difference is found across the two crops for
TE. In addition, correlation analysis for each efficiency measure between the two crops suggests a
positive but weak association. The correlation
coefficients are 0.12 for EE, 0.19 for TE, and 0.18
for AE.
For comparison purposes, Table 3 presents
efficiency indices reported in various studies using data from several countries. It is interesting to
note that our efficiency estimates tend to be
lower than those reported by other researchers.
A clear exception is the study by Taylor, Drummond and Gomes (1986), who reported technical
and economic efficiency indexes much lower than
those found in this study. Their measures were
derived from a deterministic frontier which makes
them very sensitive to outliers. In fact, Taylor and
Shonkwiler (1986) applied a stochastic frontier on
the same data as Taylor, Drummond and Gomes
(1986) and found that, as shown in Table 3,
technical efficiency increased from around 0.18 to
0.71 7 .
Several authors have investigated the relationship between efficiency and various socioeconomic variables using two alternative approaches 8 • One approach is to compute correlation coefficients or to conduct other simple non
parametric analyses. The second way, usually referred to as a two-step procedure, is to first
measure farm level efficiency and then to estimate a regression model where efficiency is expressed as a function of socioeconomic attributes.
These analyses have been criticized by some who

estimators on mean technical efficiency levels, see Bravo-Ureta
and Rieger (1990).

and Pinheiro (1993).

argue that the socioeconomic variables should be
incorporated directly in the production frontier
model because such variables may have a direct
impact on efficiency (Battese, Coelli and Colby,
1989). Kalirajan (1991) has recently defended this
practice by contending that the socioeconomic
attributes have a roundabout effect on production and, hence, should be incorporated into the
analysis indirectly. Ray (1988) has argued that the
two-step procedure is justifiable if one assumes
that the production function is multiplicatively
separable in what he calls discretionary and
nondiscretionary inputs. The former inputs are
those typically included in production function
models while the latter are those commonly used
to explain variations in efficiency. This controversy is relatively recent in the frontier literature
and, thus, additional research will be required
before a resolution is found.
Despite the controversy just mentioned, we
still believe that it is useful to examine the possible relationship between efficiency and socioeconomic characteristics. For this purpose, we use
Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to investigate the
association between EE, TE and AE, and the following seven socioeconomic characteristics: (1)
SIZE, the total number of hectares in the farm
unit; (2) AGE, given by the age of the household
head; (3) Eouc, the number of years of schooling
completed by the household head; (4) ASSIST,
equal to 1 for those farmers that received technical assistance from a variety of sources, including
private firms, the extension service, credit institutions, neighbors and/ or family members, and
zero otherwise; (5) CREDIT, equal to 1 for farmers
that reported receiving credit and zero otherwise;
(6) EXTEN, equal to 1 for farmers that reported
having contacts with the extension service and
zero otherwise; and (7) EXHRS, the number of
extension field staff hours devoted to field extension work on each crop in the district where the
farm is located.
The most striking conclusion that can be
gleaned from the ANOVA results, shown in Table
4, is the lack of a consistent pattern of association
between efficiency and socioeconomic characteristics. Some of these results, however, are consistent with findings reported by others who have

B. E. Bravo-Ureta, R.E. Evenson I Agricultural Economics 10 (1994) 27-37

studied the productivity of traditional farmers.
For example, a weak association between efficiency, and education and extension has also been
reported by Antiporta (1978) for The Philippines,
and by Cotlear (1986) for Peru. In a recent paper,
using data from Pakistan, Azhar (1991) lends
further support to the notion " ... that elementary
education (4-5 years of schooling) does not have
much effect on agricultural productivity" in traditional farm settings (p. 658) 9 • In our sample,
around 50% of the peasants had two years of
education or less, 30% had three years, and no
farmer had more than five years.
The clearest pattern that emerges is for credit
which is positively related to efficiency in five out
of six cases. However, this positive relationship is
statistically significant only in one of the six cases.
By comparison, Lingard, Castillo and J ayasuriya
(1983) also found evidence that credit had a positive impact on efficiency in their analysis of farmers in Central Luzon, in The Philippines.
Extension hours (EXHRs) exhibits the greatest
number of significant relationships with efficiency
- three out six cases. Despite this statistical significance, no clear-cut pattern emerges concerning the effect that EXHRS has on individual farm
efficiency. Finally, the lack of association found
between efficiency, and experience and farm size
has also been reported by Kalirajan and Flinn
(1983), Huang and Bagi (1984), Belbase and
Grabowski (1985) and Lingard, Castillo and Jayasuriya (1983).

6. Concluding remarks

This paper uses a stochastic efficiency decomposition methodology to derive technical, allocative and economic efficiency measures for a sample of peasant farmers located in Eastern
Paraguay. The analysis is performed separately
for two crops - cotton and cassava. This analysis

For further discussion of this point, see Lockheed, Jamison
and Lau (1981), Moock (1985), Lipton (1985) and Philipps and
Marble (1986).

shows an average economic efficiency of 40.1%
for cotton and of 52.3% for cassava, which reveals that there is considerable room for improvement in the productivity of the farms in the
sample. The results of this study suggest that this
sample of peasant farmers could increase output
and, thereby, household income through better
use of available resources given the state of technology. Gains in output stemming from improvements in productivity are important to Paraguay
considering that the opportunities to increase
farm production by bringing additional virgin
lands into cultivation have significantly diminished in recent years while at the same time
population pressure has been on the rise.
An examination of the relationship between
efficiency and various socioeconomic variables did
not reveal a clear strategy that could be recommended to improve performance. One possible
explanation for the lack of a consistent relationship between efficiency and socioeconomic indicators might be the existence of a stage of development threshold below which this type of relationship is not observed. If this is the case, then
our results imply that this sample of Paraguayan
peasants are yet to reach such a threshold. Consequently, our analysis suggests that policies to
improve education and extension services, for example, would be needed in order to go beyond
this threshold. Once this is accomplished, additional productivity gains would be obtained by
further investments in human capital and related
factors. It should be noted that this "threshold"
argument has been advanced in the literature as
a potential explanation for the absence of a relationship between a few years of education (5 or
less) and agricultural output in traditional farm
settings (Azhar, 1991; Moock, 1981, 1985).
