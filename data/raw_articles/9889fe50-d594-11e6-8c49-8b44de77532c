ABSTRACT
The objective of this paper is to test the hypothesis that farmer perceptions of technology-specific characteristics significantly condition technology adoption decisions. Earlier
adoption studies have not considered this in the analysis of the determinants of adoption
decisions. The omission of farmers' evaluation of technology-specific attributes may bias the
results of factors conditioning adoption choices.
A Tobit model was used to test this hypothesis using a stratified random sample of 124
mangrove swamp rice farmers in Sierra Leone. The issue investigated is the adoption of
improved mangrove swamp rice varieties. The estimated model results show that farmer
perceptions of the technology-specific attributes of the varieties are the major factors
determining adoption and use intensities. Indicators of adoption determinants traditionally
used in adoption-diffusion studies were found not to be important in driving adoption
decisions. Therefore, there is need for adoption studies to consider farmers' perceptions of
technology-specific attributes in the assessment of technology adoption decisions.

groups of paradigms for explaining adoption decisions can be found in the
literature: the innovation-diffusion, and the economic constraint paradigms.
The innovation-diffusion model, following from the work of Rogers,
holds that access to information about an innovation is the key factor
determining adoption decisions (for a good review see Argarwal, 1983).
The appropriateness of the innovation is taken as given, and the problem
of technology adoption is reduced to communicating information on the
technology to the potential end users. By emphasizing the use of extension,
media and local opinion leaders or by the use of experiment station visits
and on-farm trials the 'skeptic' non-adopters can be shown that it is
rational to adopt.
The economic constraint model (Aikens et al., 1975) contends that
economic constraints reflected in asymmetrical distribution patterns of
resource endowments are the major determinants of observed adoption
behavior. Lack of access to capital (Havens and Flinn, 1976) or land (Yapa
and Mayfield, 1978) could significantly constrain adoption decisions. While
attempts have been made to assert the 'superiority' of the economic
constraint model over the innovation-diffusion model (Hooks et al., 1983),
such conclusions have been challenged (Nowak, 1987).
A third paradigm, which we shall call the 'adopter perception' paradigm
(Kivlin and Fliegel, 1966a,b, 1967) - the least quantitatively developed in
the literature - constitutes the focus of this paper. The concept, which is
now being implicitly used in one form or the other in the agricultural
economics literature (Gould et al., 1989; Norris and Batie, 1987; Lynne et
al., 1988), suggests that the perceived attributes of innovations condition
adoption behavior. The limited quantitative studies that have considered
farmers' perceptions in the context of adoption decisions (e.g. Gould et al.,
1989; Norris and Batie, 1987), have included a perception variable measuring farmers' perception of a problem (e.g. soil erosion) - in their
models. However, by being concerned primarily with only the farmers'
perceptions regarding the severity of the problem to be solved, the studies
implicitly take the technical innovations (designed to solve the problem) as
appropriate for farmers.
Therefore, a gap exists in the adoption literature: How do farmers'
perceptions of the technology-specific attributes themselves condition
adoption decisions? Farmers have subjective preferences for technology
characteristics (Ashby and Sperling, 1992; Ashby et al., 1989) and these
could play major roles in technology adoption. Adoption (rejection) of
technologies by farmers may reflect rational decision making based upon
farmers' perceptions of the appropriateness (inappropriateness) of the
characteristics of the technologies under investigation. By extending the
analysis to cover the attributes of the technology that may condition

adoption behavior, ex-post adoption studies could further increase their
utility for directing appropriate technology development strategies.
Therefore, the objective of this paper is to test the hypothesis that
farmer perceptions of technology-specific characteristics significantly explains technology adoption decisions. It is argued that the omission of such
variables in adoption models may bias the results on the factors determining adoption decisions of farmers. The specific case examined in the paper
is farmers' adoption decisions regarding modern mangrove swamp rice
varieties in Sierra Leone. The rest of the paper is divided into five sections.
Section 2 gives an overview of the adoption of modern mangrove swamp
rice varieties in Sierra Leone. Section 3 discusses the conceptual model,
while Section 4 presents the empirical model. Section 5 discusses the
empirical results, and the paper ends in Section 6 with conclusions.
2. MODERN MANGROVE SWAMP RICE VARIETIES IN SIERRA LEONE

The mangrove rice ecology stretches about 1.2 million hectares in West
Africa, out of which over 200 000 ha are currently under cultivation in
Guinea-Bissau, Gambia, Guinea, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria. Mangrove swamps are located on the tidal estuaries close to the ocean. They
are difficult environments for growing rice, particularly during the dry
season, when salts deposited by the tidal flows are not easily washed off the
land. Rice growing is restricted to the rainy season when the rains flush salt
from the soil. The rice growing period is directly related to the distance of
the rice cultivating areas from the sea. The length of the salt-free period
increases with increasing distance away from the sea. Three mangrove rice
growing zones can be distinguished depending on the duration of the
salt-free periods: (1) short season zone: with salt-free periods of less than 4
months; (2) medium growing season zone: with salt-free periods of 4-6
months; and (3) long growing season zone: with salt-free periods of more
than 6 months.
Over 3000 mangrove rice varieties and lines (both local germplasm and
crosses with introduced lines) have been screened and 17 high-yielding
varieties have been recommended to farmers in West Africa (WARDA,
1989). A number of these modern mangrove rice varieties are high-yielding,
fit the different salt-free growing periods, and show tolerance to some
major pests and diseases such as blast, stem borers and crabs (WARDA,
1989). The modern mangrove swamp rice varieties that were investigated in
this study (i.e. ROK 5, ROK 10, Kuatik Kundur and CP 4) were introduced
into Sierra Leone through collaborative research between the Sierra Leone
Rice Research Station and the West Africa Rice Development Association.
ROK 5 is a short-duration variety ( < 4 months), Kuatik Kundur is a

medium duration variety (4-6 months); ROK 10, ADNY-301 and CP-4 are
long season varieties ( > 6 months). The adoption patterns of the modern
varieties (Table 1) show that in the Great Scarcies study zone, these
varieties have met with extensive adoption among farmers. The percent of
farmers adopting improved varieties increased from 5% in 1986 to 52% in
1990. ROK 5, ROK 10 and Kuatik Kundur had been adopted by 20%, 16%
and 16% of farmers, respectively, in 1990. The area cultivated under
improved varieties rose from 11% in 1988 to 21% in 1990.
3. CONCEPTUAL MODEL

Following Rahm and Huffman (1984), farmers' adoption decisions on
the modern mangrove rice varieties are assumed to be based upon utility
maximization. Define the varietal technologies by j, where j = 1 for the
new technology and j = 2 for the old technology. The non-observable
underlying utility function which ranks the preference of the ith farmer is
given by U(Mji• A j). Thus, the utility derivable from the varietal technology depends on M which is a vector of farm and farmer-specific attributes
of the adopter and A which is a vector of the attributes associated with the
technology. Although the utility function is unobserved, the relation between the utility derivable from a jth technology is postulated to be a
function of the vector of observed farm, farmer specific characteristics (e.g.,
farm size, age, experience of farmer), and the technology specific characteristic (e.g., yield, taste, tillering capacity etc) and a disturbance term having
a zero mean:
j=1,2;i=1, ... ,n
(1)

301

Equation (1) does not restrict the function F to be linear. As the utilities
are random, the ith farmer will select the alternative j = 1 if Uli > U2 i
or if the non-observable (latent) random variable y * = Uli - U2 i > 0. The
probability that ¥; equals one (i.e., that the farmer adopts an improved rice
variety) is a function of the independent variables:
~i

=Pr(~ti> -Fi(Mi, Ai)/3)

Fi(Xi/3)

where X is the n X k matrix of the explanatory variables, and f3 is a k X 1
vector of parameters to be estimated, Pr( ·) is a probability function, ILi is
an random error term, and F(Xif3) is the cumulative distribution function
for ILi evaluated at Xi/3. The probability that a farmer will adopt the
modern mangrove rice variety is a function of the vector of explanatory
variables and of the unknown parameters and error term. For all practical
purposes, equation (2) cannot be estimated directly without knowing the
form of F. It is the distribution of ILi that determines the distribution of F.
If lti is normal, F will have a cumulative normal distribution (Rahm and
Huffman, 1984).
Following equation (2) the functional form of F is specified with a Tobit
model, where lti is an independently, normally distributed error term with
zero mean and constant variance a 2 :

¥; =Xi/3

+ ILi > T
if i* =Xi/3 + ~Li::::;, T
if

i* =Xi/3

(3)

where y; is the probability of adopting (and the intensity of use of) the
modern mangrove rice varieties; i* is a non-observable latent variable, and
T is a non-observed threshold level.
The Tobit model (Tobin, 1958) therefore measures not only the probability that a mangrove rice farmer will adopt the new variety but also the
intensity of use of the technology once adopted. Thus, equation (3) is a
simultaneous and stochastic decision model. If the non-observed latent
variable i* is greater than T, the observed qualitative variable yi that
indexes adoption becomes a continuous function of the explanatory variables, and 0 otherwise. (i.e. no adoption). In cases where substantially large
numbers of decision makers have completely adopted the technology, a
variant of the one-limit Tobit model in equation (3) (i.e. a 2-limit Tobit
proposed by Rossett and Nelson (1975)), could be used (e.g. Gould et al.,

302

A.A. ADESINA AND M.M. ZINNAH

1989). Such an application of the Tobit analysis is, however, not appropriate for this study as only seven farmers (or 3% of the respondents) had
completely adopted the improved rice varieties on all their total cropped
area. The use of the one-limit Tobit model in this study is consistent with
other earlier studies (Akinola and Young, 1985; Shakya and Flinn, 1985;
Norris and Batie, 1987).
4. EMPIRICAL MODEL

The data on which the empirical model is based were collected in
1990-1991 during an intensive 6-month village level survey of a stratified
random sample of 124 mangrove swamp rice farmers in the Great Scarcies
area of Sierra Leone. The estimated empirical model, derived from equation (1) to equation (3), was developed using the farm and farmer specific
attributes and farmer perception variables regarding technology specific
characteristics of the modern varieties. The dependent variable is the
proportion of the total varietal portfolio mix (i.e. local and improved
varieties) that is constituted by improved varieties The definitions and
measurements, and the sample characteristics of the variables are given in
Table 2 and Table 3, respectively. Further details are available elsewhere
(Zinnah, 1992).
The attribute vector A in equation (1) was specified in the empirical
model to include the following variables: taste, yield, ease of cooking,
tillering capacity and the ease of threshing the harvested rice. Taste is an
important attribute desired by rice farmers, especially since rice is mainly
home-consumed in the study zone. Surveys in other parts of West Africa
have found that taste of rice was cited as an important trait desired by rice
consumers (Adewusi et al., 1991). Ease of cooking of rice is directly linked
to chemical characteristic of the rice grain (i.e. the gelatinization temperature). Varieties having high gelatinization temperatures take longer periods
to cook (Unnevehr, 1986; Adewusi et al., 1991). Such a trait should be
important to mangrove swamp rice farmers given that fuel-wood supply is
severely limited along the mangrove swamps. Women and children in
mangrove swamp rice cultivating households (especially those closer to the
sea) often have to travel several kilometers by boats in search of fuel-wood
in the upland zones. It is hypothesized that ease of cooking is positively
related to adoption.
Ease of threshing is hypothesized to be positively related to adoption.
The traditional methods of threshing rice are highly labor intensive and
consist of either pounding the harvested paddy with sticks or with the sole
of the feet. Therefore, varieties that are easier to thresh are more likely to
be preferred by farmers. Tillering ability of rice is important to mangrove
swamp farmers, as they link this with tolerance to crab damage, a major

problem to young rice seedlings in mangrove rice ecologies (WARDA,
1989). Varieties with high tillering capacity still give good yields despite
crab damage, especially due to the re-growth of new tillers. It is hypothesized that tillering capacity is positively related to probability of adoption.
The perceived superior yield performance of modern rice variety is
expected to be related to adoption and use intensities. On-farm trials in the
study zone show that the modern varieties have significantly out-performed
local varieties under farmers' conditions (Adams, 1986). Therefore, it is
hypothesized that the perceived yield superiority of the modern varieties is
positively linked with adoption decisions.
The farm and farmer specific factors included in the model (i.e. vector
M) are based on innovation diffusion theory and earlier studies. These
include age of the farmer; farm size; participation in on-farm mangrove
rice trials; contact with extension agents and the years of experience since
the farmer became an owner of a mangrove rice farm. The latter is to be
distinguished from general farming experience. General farming experience is not relevant for the empirical model since most farmers judge their
total experience as starting from the first day that they started going out
with their parents to the mangrove rice fields. What is important is the
experience since the farmer became a decision maker on his own field
(Mueller and Jansen, 1988).
Farm size has been shown to positively affect adoption decisions (Polson
and Spencer, 1991; Akinola, 1987; Norris and Batie, 1987). Therefore, it is
hypothesized that the sign on this variable in the empirical model is
positive. Studies have shown that age of the farmer is related to adoption
decisions. Younger farmers have been found to be more knowledgeable
about new practices and may be more willing to bear risk due to their
longer planning horizons (Bultena and Hoiberg, 1983; Gould et al., 1989;
Polson and Spencer, 1991). Following earlier empirical findings, the maintained hypothesis is that age is negatively related to adoption.
Contact with extension agents is expected to have a positive effect on
adoption based upon the innovation-diffusion theory. Such contacts, by
exposing farmers to availability of information can be expected to stimulate
adoption (Polson and Spencer, 1991; Voh, 1982; Osuntogun et al., 1986;
Kebede et al., 1990). Years of experience in mangrove swamp rice farming
is expected to be related to the ability of the farmer to obtain, process, and
use information relevant to cultivation under this rice ecology. A positive
relationship is hypothesized between this variable and the probability of
adoption of modern swamp rice varieties. Participation in on-farm experimental trials on mangrove rice is an 'exposure variable' and is hypothesized
to be positively related to adoption.
Three variations of the empirical model were estimated: (1) using only

When only the farm and farmer specific characteristics are considered
(model 1), none of these variables are significant at 0.05 significance level.
However, at the 0.10 significance level, participation in on-farm tests and
contacts with extension agents are significant in explaining adoption decisions. Apart from age, all the farm and farmer specific variables are
positively related to adoption decisions (Table 4). When only the farmer
perceptions of technology-specific characteristics are considered (model 2),
all of the varietal specific traits, except taste, were highly significant (at the
0.01 and 0.05 significance levels) in explaining adoption and use intensities

of the modern rice varieties. In conformity with the maintained hypotheses,
all these varietal specific variables, including taste, are also positively
related to the probability of adoption and the intensity of use of the
modern mangrove rice varieties (Table 5). Combining both farm and
farmer specific, and technology specific variables (model 3), the results
show that none of the farm and farmer specific factors argued in the
adoption literature was significant in explaining the adoption decisions of
modern mangrove rice varieties. Rather, farmer perceptions of the technology-specific traits of these varieties have been the major factors conditioning adoption behavior (Table 6). These results, which are robust, strongly
confirm the maintained hypotheses that farmers' perceptions of attributes
of agricultural technologies determine observed adoption choices. Thus,
past conclusions often reported in the adoption and diffusion literature
about how farm and farmer specific factors significantly affect adoption of
agricultural technologies were not supported by evidences from this study.
The empirical model can be used to draw economic implications for
commodity improvement strategies for mangrove swamp rice in Sierra

Leone. Following a Tobit decomposition framework suggested by McDonald and Moffitt (1980), the effects of changes of the varietal specific traits
on adoption probabilities and use intensities can be obtained.
Let the expected value of the dependent variable PROPOTN across all
observations be represented as E(P), the expected value of the dependent
variable conditional on the mangrove rice farmer being above the threshold
limit (i.e. already an adopter and thus now concerned about use intensities)
be given as E( p ), and the probability of the farmer being above the limit
(i.e. the probability of adoption) be represented as F( z ), where z = X{3 j lf.
The relationship between these variables can be shown to be:

E(P) = F(z) * E(p)

308

A.A. ADESINA AND M.M. ZINNAH

For a given change in the level of the varietal specific attributes in the
mangrove rice breeding program, the effects on farmer adoption behavior
can be broken down into two parts by differentiating equation (4) with
respect to the specific varietal attribute change:

3E(P)j3Xi = F(z)[3E(p)j3XJ + E(p)[3F(z)j3Xi]

(5.1)

Multiplying through by XJE(P), the relation in equation (5.1) can be
converted into elasticity forms:

[3E(P)j3Xi]XJE(P)

=

F(z)[3E(p)j3Xi]XJE(P)

+ E(p)[3F(z)j3Xi]XJE(P)

Therefore, total elasticity of a change in the level of any of the varietal
specific characteristics (which is assumed to be directly perceived by
farmers) consists of two effects: (a) the change in the elasticity of the use
intensities of the modern mangrove rice varieties, for those mangrove rice
farmers that are already adopters; and (b) the change in the elasticity of
the probability of being an adopter.
The computed elasticities, using model 3, are reported in Table 7. The
estimates show that marginal changes in the perceived technology specific
characteristics increases the probability of adoption of the rice varieties
more than it increases the use intensities. However, the elasticity estimates
show inelastic responses to changes in these characteristics. Cooking quality characteristic has the highest impact on the probability of adoption and
use intensities. The total elasticity value is 0.86, which is divided into 0.45
for the elasticity of adoption probability and 0.41 for the elasticity of use

intensity. This suggests that a 10% improvement in the ease of cooking
characteristic is expected to result in about 9% increase in the adoption
and use intensities of the improved rice varieties. The probability of
adoption will increase by 5%, while the use intensities will increase by 4%.
Improving the tillering capacity of modern varieties in breeding programs is
estimated to increase the total elasticity by 0.58, which is decomposed into
0.30 for the elasticity of the probability of adoption and 0.28 for the
elasticity of the expected use intensity. Improving the yield and the ease of
threshing characteristics are estimated to have similar effects on the total
adoption elasticities and its' components. In each case, the total elasticity
of 0.50 consists of 0.26 due to the elasticity of adoption and 0.24 attributable to the elasticity of expected use intensities.
Breeding efforts targeted solely at improving taste of the modern varieties is estimated to have little or no effect on adoption elasticities. This
result may indicate that farmers are well used to the taste of their existing
local varieties and are more likely to judge the local varieties as better in
terms of taste. Nonetheless, research programs may wish to treat taste
improvement as an important component of overall breeding objectives,
but with much limited emphasis compared to the aforementioned factors.
6. CONCLUSIONS

This paper showed that farmer perceptions of technology-specific characteristics significantly condition technology adoption decisions. The results
showed that the omission of such variables in adoption models may bias the
results of the factors determining adoption decisions of farmers.
The results strongly suggest that farmer perceptions of technologyspecific characteristics should be considered in evaluating the determinants
of adoption decisions on agricultural technologies. Such variables will
enrich the set of factors conventionally used in adoption studies (Feder et
al., 1985)
