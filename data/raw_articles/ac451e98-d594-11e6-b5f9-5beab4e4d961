ABSTRACT
Lerman, Z. and Parliament, C., 1991. Size and industry effects m the performance of
agricultural cooperatives. Agric. Econ., 6: 15-29.
The objective of this study is to determine if there are important size and industry effects
on financial performance of agricultural cooperatives. The performance of 43 dairy, food,
grain, and farm supply cooperatives in the U.S. was analyzed over the period 1970-1987
using financial ratios derived from accounting data. The analysis revealed significant size
and industry effects. Large regional cooperatives are more efficient in utilizing their assets
to generate sales, while small regional cooperatives have higher profitability. The findings
suggest that the emphasis on growth may not always produce beneficial results among
agricultural cooperatives. Among the four industries studied, the dairy regional cooperatives
appear to be the strongest performers, while the food marketing cooperatives are characterized by the lowest performance measures. Since both dairy and food cooperatives engage in
value-added processing, this difference in performance makes it difficult to reach clear
conclusions about possible advantages of disadvantages or vertical integration relative to
traditional cooperative activities. Trend analysis indicates that the profitability of the
agricultural cooperatives in all industry and size categories declined in response to the
downturn in U.S. agriculture after 1980. While the decline in profitability was at similar
rates for both large and small cooperatives, the variation of efficiency and leverage was in
opposite directions. Large cooperatives may be expected to continue improving their asset
utilization without relative improvement in profitability, and increasing the level of their
debt in relation to equity.

INTRODUCTION

Performance evaluation of cooperatives has always been a topic of
considerable interest in agricultural economics, primarily because of the
significance of the cooperative form of organization in agriculture in both
developed and developing countries. Traditionally, agricultural cooperatives have been encouraged as a vehicle for economic development, because the cooperative form of organization, in addition to being equitable,
enables small producers to capture economies of size and increases their
marketing power. Governments jn both developed and developing countries actively promote and assist agricultural cooperatives. Justification of
continued public support of the cooperative form of organization requires
evaluation and monitoring of cooperative performance.
The objective of this study is to determine if there are significant size
and industry effects on performance among cooperatives. Size effects, if
detected, may help to determine whether cooperatives should emphasize
growth, as has been evident in the persistence of mergers among U.S.
cooperatives. Industry effects, if found, may indicate whether the cooperative form of organization is more successful in the traditional industries of
input supply and raw produce marketing than in the vertically integrated
industries that include valued-added processing. The industry results may
provide some evidence to resolve the conflict between cooperative strategists emphasizing traditional service activities and those advocating a shift
toward value-added processing.
The next section describes the data and the methodology. The two
sections that follow present the results on size and industry effects. Conclusions and policy implications are given in the last section.
DATA AND METHODOLOGY

Financial economists generally agree that investor-owned firms may be
viewed as value-maximizers and their performance can be measured by
profitability adjusted for risk. The objective function of cooperatives is
much less clearly defined, however, especially because the cooperative
exists in order to provide a service to its members and the benefits of the
cooperative form of organization are not restricted to earning a return on
investment. As a result, there is a lack of accepted measures of cooperative
performance.
The present research partially overcomes this difficulty by adopting a
multidimensional approach. Four measures of business performance of
cooperatives are examined: leverage, efficiency, liquidity, and profitability.
Performance is analyzed by financial ratios based on reported accounting

The before-tax rate of return on equity is used because some cooperatives do not report
taxes in their income statement due to the possible impact of patronage refund policies on
tax obligation. Eight cooperatives in the sample do not report profit or net margins in
their financial statements. For these cooperatives (all in the food industry), the profit was
estimated using the technique developed in Lerman and Parliament (1990a).

data, a standard technique borrowed from investor-owned firms for financial performance evaluation of cooperatives (Babb and Lang, 1985; Chen et
al., 1985; Schrader et al., 1985; Parliament et al., 1990). These performance
measures focus on the cooperative as a business firm and do not capture
possible additional benefits to members. Yet financial ratios reflect the
effect of strategic decisions and should reveal if differences exist among
cooperatives in different size and industry categories.
Table 1 presents the definitions of the four financial ratios used in this
research. These particular financial ratios were chosen because of their
direct link to corporate strategy and objectives. The relevance of these
financial ratios for measuring the performance of cooperatives is discussed
by Parliament et al. (1990), who also review some alternative measures of
cooperative performance that focus on benefits to members.
The database for this research consists of the audited annual reports of a
sample of 43 U.S. regional cooperatives for the period 1970-1987. The
data were collected by writing to over 200 non-bargaining cooperatives
listed in the Directory of Farmer Cooperatives of the USDA Agricultural
Cooperative Service (ACS) (Jermolowicz and Kennedy, 1989). The sample
includes all the respondents that provided their annual reports by the end
of 1989. These are mainly regional cooperatives, similar in sales volume
characteristics to the top 100 U.S. cooperatives regularly surveyed by ACS.

The 43 regional cooperatives were classified into four industries: 12 dairy
cooperatives, 12 supply cooperatives, 14 food marketing and processing
cooperatives, and five grain and cotton marketing cooperatives. 1 The
cooperatives were also classified into two size categories, 'small' and
'large', by their total assets. The range of mean total assets of the cooperatives in the sample was from $3 million to $911 million (averaged over the
sample period). The distribution of mean asset size for the cooperatives is
shown in Fig. 1. For purposes of size analysis, 29 cooperatives with mean
total assets up to $125 million were classified as 'small' and 14 cooperatives
with mean total assets of over $125 million were classified as 'large'. The
size classification threshold was identified by an agglomerative cluster
analysis of the cooperatives by mean asset size. Figure 2 presents the
distribution of the 43 cooperatives by industry and by size within each
industry.

1 There was initial uncertainty as to the proper classification of grain and cotton cooperatives in the sample. Because grain marketing cooperatives also sell farm inputs to their
members, it could be argued that they should be classified as supply cooperatives. Because
cotton cooperatives operate on a pooling basis, it could be argued that they should be
classified with the pooling food cooperatives. The uncertainty was resolved by applying
multivariate discriminant analysis, which indicated that grain marketing cooperatives were
distinct from the supply cooperatives and furthermore could be combined with the cotton
cooperatives into one category. Discriminant analysis also established tha:t cotton cooperatives could not be classified with food cooperatives. It was thus decided to classify the grain
and cotton marketing cooperatives as a separate, although admittedly small, category.

The financial ratios of all the cooperatives were calculated from their
audited annual reports for each year during the period 1970-1987. The
time-series data were used to trace the behavior of cooperatives in different categories over time. For each observation year, the median of each of
the four financial ratios was calculated separately in each industry and size
category. In this way, a time series of 18 median observations was obtained
for each financial ratio by industry and size categories. The median was
chosen as the descriptive statistic because it is more robust to outliers than
the mean, and examination of the data revealed occasional outliers.
The 1970-1987 time series of the median financial ratios were analyzed
using the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test ("one-way analysis of variance
by ranks") in order to detect significant differences among industry and
size categories (Daniel, 1978). In application to the two size categories, the
Kruskal-Wallis test coincides with the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The test
ranks the pooled median financial ratios in different categories and forms
the sums of the ranks for the pooled sample. If the rank sums, or the

20

Z. LERMAN AND C. PARLIAMENT

average scores, are sufficiently different among the categories, the test
rejects the null hypothesis that the median financial ratios are the same
across categories and establishes that, with a certain probability, the
industry or size categories have different median financial ratios. The
average rank scores in each category can be used to rank performance. The
performance ranking of the different categories over the 1970-1987 period
obtained in this way was verified by Page's nonparametric test for ordered
alternatives (Daniel, 1978). Since the Page test results confirm and reinforce the Kruskal-Wallis test results, only the latter are reported in full.
In addition to tests of the performance ranking of categories, linear
regression analysis of the median time series was used to identify differences in financial ratio trends by size and industry and to predict possible
future changes in the performance rankings observed for the period 19701987. Trends were determined by running ordinary least-squares regressions for each median ratio on time with dummy variables for size and
industry. The large cooperatives were the base for estimation of regression
coefficients with size dummy variables, and the dairy category was the base
for regression coefficient estimation with industry dummy variables. Two
groups of tests were performed on the estimated regression coefficients: (a)
homogeneity-of-slopes tests for significant difference of the estimated
parameters between the base category and other categories, and (b) multivariate tests for significant difference from zero of the estimated parameters corresponding to different size and industry categories.
SIZE EFFECTS

Pronounced size effects were observed between large and small cooperatives over the period 1970-1987. The Kruskal-Wallis test results presented
in Table 2 show that three of the four ratios (profitability, liquidity, and

efficiency) were significantly different between the large and small cooperatives at the 5% level of significance. The median efficiency of asset
utilization was significantly higher for the large cooperatives, while the
median liquidity and profitability measures were significantly higher for the
small cooperatives. Only the median leverage was not found to be significantly different between the two size categories.
To illustrate the dispersion of the ratio values in each year, the top and
bottom (25% and 75%) quartiles of the financial ratios were calculated for
each year for the large and the small cooperatives. The interquartile range
traces a band around the median that contains 50% of the observed ratio
values in the sample of cooperatives for each particular year (this band is
not necessarily symmetric about the median). The interquartile range is a
nonparametric measure of dispersion analogous to standard deviation.
Examination of the interquartile range of the two size categories over time
provides a visual confirmation of the Kruskal-Wallis test results presented
in Table 2.
Figure 3 (panels a to d) superimposes the interquartile range of small
and large cooperatives for each ratio. Panel a shows that the interquartile
range of the leverage ratio for the large cooperatives lies almost entirely
within the interquartile range for the small cooperatives over the period
1970-1987. The overlapping interquartile ranges indicate that the median
leverage is not significantly different for the small and the large cooperatives.
In panel b, the interquartile range of the efficiency ratio for the large
cooperatives lies within the interquartile range for the small cooperatives
until about 1979, after which the top quartile value of the large cooperatives is consistently higher than the top quartile value of the small cooperatives. The graphical presentation reveals that the difference between large
and small cooperatives became more pronounced over the later period
1979-1987. Large cooperatives thus appear to be more efficient than the
small cooperatives in utilizing their assets to generate sales.
In panel c, the top quartile of the liquidity ratio for the small cooperatives consistently lies above the top quartile for the large cooperatives,
while the bottom quartiles roughly overlap. This indicates that the small
cooperatives maintain a higher liquidity than the large cooperatives.
Panel d presents the interquartile range of the profitability ratio. The
upper quartile of the rate of return on equity (RoE) for the small cooperatives lies above the upper ROE quartile for the large cooperatives in 17 out
of 18 years, and the bottom quartile of the small cooperatives lies above the
bottom quartile of the large cooperatives in 14 out of the 18 years. The ROE
for the small cooperatives is thus observed to be higher over most of the
sample period than for the large cooperatives.

Trend analysis results for the median financial ratios of the large and the
small cooperatives are presented in Table 3. The median leverage ratio
shows significantly different trends for the two size categories, increasing
over time for the large cooperatives and declining for the small cooperatives. If this difference continues, large cooperatives may develop in the
future significantly higher levels of debt relative to equity than the small
cooperatives, contrary to the pattern observed between 1970 and 1987 (Fig.
3a). The median efficiency of the large cooperatives increases over time,
while that of the small cooperatives declines, which should only strengthen
in the future the advantage that large cooperatives had between 1970 and
1987 in utilizing their assets to generate sales (Fig. 3b). Both profitability
and liquidity reveal a declining trend, but the rate of decline is not
significantly different for the large and the small cooperatives, which
suggests that the advantage in profitability and liquidity observed for the
small cooperatives between 1970 and 1987 may be maintained in the
future.
Thus, while the large cooperatives are observed to be more efficient in
utilizing their assets to generate sales, the small cooperatives have higher
profitability and liquidity. The results suggest that large cooperatives may
enjoy scale economies in terms of efficiency, but the benefits of size do not
necessarily translate into higher profitability. The higher rate of return on
equity for the small cooperatives is consistent with the "small-firm effect"
observed for investor owned corporations, which shows that investors in
small firms usually earn higher rates of return on investment [see Levy and
Lerman (1985) and references therein]. With respect to liquidity, it could
be hypothesized that small firms, with a relatively small asset base, prefer
to maintain a higher liquidity buffer than large, asset-rich firms. With
respect to leverage, it could similarly be argued that small cooperatives
would have a lower leverage than the large, more secure cooperatives.

differences in capital structure between small and large cooperatives, the
trend analysis results support an expectation of higher leverage for the
large cooperatives.
INDUSTRY EFFECTS

Clear industry effects were found for all median financial ratios. The
Kruskal-Wallis test results (Table 4) show that for leverage, efficiency, and
liquidity the industry effects were significant at 1%. The statistical test
results are visually confirmed by the time series graphs in Fig. 4 (panels a
to d). The graphs in Fig. 4 plot only the median ratios by industry over the
period 1970-1987, as it was not practicable to superimpose the interquartile ranges for the four industries.
The leverage ratio (panel a) was found to be the highest for the food
marketing cooperatives and the lowest for the supply cooperatives, with the
dairy and grain cooperatives lying in the middle.
The four industries are also clearly differentiated by efficiency (panel b).
Dairies consistently have th'e highest efficiency, followed by grain and
supply cooperatives in this order, with the food marketing cooperatives
consistently at the bottom of the ranking.
Liquidity is the highest for dairy and supply cooperatives, which both
have relatively high quick ratios near the level of 1.0 (panel c), while food
and grain cooperatives have relatively low quick ratios around 0.5. The
Kruskal-Wallis test indicates that only the differences between the food
and grain cooperatives are not significant.
The differences in profitability between dairy, food, and grain cooperatives are not statistically significant. Yet the median ROE of the cooperatives in these three industries combined is significantly higher than that of

the supply cooperatives (at 5% level of significance by the Kruskal-Wallis
test).
The trends of the median financial ratios by industry are presented in
Table 5. The median debt to equity ratios of the cooperatives in the four
industries show a converging trend, mainly as a result of the declining
leverage of the dairy and food cooperatives and the increasing leverage of
the supply cooperatives (compare Fig. 4a). It might be conjectured that the
highly leveraged food and dairy cooperatives benefited from erosion of
their fixed-rate debt in the inflationary period 1973-1980: their equity
component may have increased through unrealized capital gains, driving
the leverage ratio down over time. The median sales to assets ratio of the
dairy, food, and supply cooperatives does not show a significant trend over
time, and the relative efficiency ranking of these industries will probably be
maintained in the future (Fig. 4b). The grain cooperatives show a significant improvement of their sales to assets ratio, and as a result may
challenge in the future the top ranking dairy cooperatives. The rate of
return on equity (RoE) reveals a significant declining trend for cooperatives
in three of the four industries; only the estimated coefficient of the food
cooperatives, while negative, is not significantly different from zero. The
estimated decline in median ROE may be due to the general downturn in
the U.S. agricultural sector during the 1980s, as separate analysis using only
the 1970-1979 data did not reveal significant downward trends in profitability during the pre-1980 decade for three out of the four industries
(except the grain cooperatives).
In summary, on a naive multiobjective scale that assigns equal weights to
the four ratios (Table 6), the dairy cooperatives appear to be the strongest
performers among the four industries, ranking first in efficiency and
liquidity and second in leverqge and profitability. The food marketing
cooperatives are the weakest performers, ranking lowest in leverage, effi-

of the ranking.
CONCLUSION

One of the persistent trends among cooperatives is growth through
mergers and acquisitions. The findings of this study indicate that although
larger cooperatives improve efficiency through economies of scale, the
higher efficiency of asset utilization does not translate into higher profitability. This suggests that the benefits of mergers may be overemphasized,
which is consistent with recent findings indicating that the profitability of
cooperatives does not significantly improve after a merger (Parliament and
Taitt, 1989).
The industry effects revealed in this study do not provide conclusive
evidence to support either side of the strategic conflict between the
advocates of traditional service activities and the advocates of diversification through value-added processing. The dairy cooperatives, which engage
in value-added processing, are the highest ranking performers among the
four industries by leverage, efficiency, liquidity, and profitability ratios. The
food cooperatives, on the other hand, are at the bottom of the ranking,
although they also engage in extensive value-added processing.
The grain and supply cooperatives, which have generally limited their
activities to the traditional areas of raw produce marketing and input
purchasing, show a higher performance ranking than the food cooperatives
engaging in value-added processing. It could be argued that the relatively
strong performance of the dairy cooperatives in the U.S. is related to
government guaranteed prices for the milk used in dairy products. If this is

28

Z. LERMAN AND C. PARLIAMENT

indeed so, the inferior performance of the food processing cooperatives
may be interpreted as consistent with the view that, in the absence of
specific support programs for value-added processing, cooperatives should
consider restricting their scope to traditional activities.
In a recent comparison of cooperatives and investor-owned firms (Lerman and Parliament, 1990b), the food cooperatives were found to have a
weaker performance than the investor-owned firms in the same industry by
three of the six performance measures considered while the dairy cooperatives performed not worse than the investor-owned dairies by all measures.
These findings indicate that the relatively weak performance of the food
cooperatives observed in the present study cannot be entirely attributed to
industry-specific factors. There are indications that, of the two value-added
processing industries, the dairy cooperatives have a higher proportion of
pass-through sales than the food-processing cooperatives: the proportion of
fluid milk sales in dairies is higher than the proportion of raw produce
sales in food-processing cooperatives. These factors also could be interpreted as supporting the view that expansion into value-added processing
has not been a total success for cooperatives.
An international comparison is provided by a recent study of two
regional agricultural cooperatives in Israel (Yacobi, 1989), where the cooperative engaging in value-added food processing had significantly higher
leverage, lower profitability, and lower efficiency than the cooperative that
limited its activities to raw produce marketing. The Israeli analogy, however limited, appears to support those who believe that manufacturing of
value-added consumer products may not be a particularly advantageous
activity for cooperatives, despite the allure of forward integration. Cooperatives may find it difficult to acquire the necessary resources for successful
penetration of the consumer food markets.
Support programs, product mix, and market characteristics are ultimately responsible for success or failure of value-added processing. Further
research is needed in order to identify and separate the government
support component in the performance of U.S. dairy cooperatives and to
analyze the cooperatives in the two valued-added processing industries on
the basis of the specific mix of pass-through sales and value-added products. More detailed comparisons between cooperatives and investor-owned
firms in corresponding industries are needed in order to separate between
industry-specific and cooperative-specific factors. This additional research
may produce more conclusive results regarding the debate between supporters of traditional cooperatives and advocates of vertical integration. At
this stage, the striking difference in performance between the two valueadded processing industries in our sample makes it difficult to generalize
about the relative merits of value-added processing for cooperatives.
