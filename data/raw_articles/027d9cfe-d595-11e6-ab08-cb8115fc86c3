Abstract
The paper investigates the linkages between technological change and production risk, with an application to corn. The
effects of technology on risk exposure are analyzed. We define technological progress to be risk-increasing (risk-decreasing)
if it increases (decreases) the relative risk premium. The analysis is applied to panel data from Wisconsin research stations.
Conditional moments (including mean, variance and skewness) of corn yield, grain moisture and corn profit are estimated for
different sites. We investigate how the trade-off between expected return and the risk premium varies over time and over space.
The empirical results indicate that technological progress contributes to reducing the exposure to risk as well as downside risk
in corn production, although this effect varies across sites. They also stress the role of the relative maturity of corn hybrids as
a means of managing risk.

1. Introduction

Technological change has contributed to large increases in agricultural productivity (e.g. Ball et al.,
1979; Brennan, 1984; Master et al., 1998; Byerlee,
1996). Besides improving productivity, technological
change has also affected production risk (e.g. Antle
and Crissman, 1990; Binswanger and Barah, 1980).
While genetic improvements have increased mean

crop yields, they have also affected yield variability.
For example, while the green revolution generated
increases in both mean and variance of yield, Traxler
et al. (1995) found that the post-green revolution era
exhibited both slower mean yield growth and declining yield risk. This latter effect can be attributed in
part to genetic improvements targeted to improved
pest and disease resistance.
Interest in risk issues is motivated by the empirical
evidence that most farmers are risk averse (e.g. Lin
et al., 1974; Binswanger, 1981; Antle, 1987; Saha
et al., 1994). This suggests that technological change
can also generate benefits by reducing the farmers'
exposure to production risk. In addition, the empirical
evidence indicates that most farmers exhibit decreasing absolute risk aversion (e.g. Binswanger, 1981;
Chavas and Holt, 1996). This implies that farmers

are averse to 'downside risk' (Antle, 1987). Intuitively, this means that farmers are especially
averse to being exposed to unexpectedly low returns.
This has motivated research on the role of downside risk in risk management, including the 'safety
first' approach (e.g. Roumasset, 1976). Much research has analyzed agricultural risk, including the
mean-variance investigation of input effects (e.g. Just
and Pope, 1997) and technology (e.g. Traxler et al.,
1995). Yet, the influence of technological change on
downside risk exposure (e.g. on the probability of
crop failure) remains poorly understood. There is a
need to refine our understanding of the linkages between technological change and exposure to risk and
downside risk in agriculture, with implications for the
cost of private risk bearing.
This study presents an economic analysis of risk
exposure in corn production and corn profitability at
the edge of the Corn Belt. Following Antle (1983)
and Antle and Goodger (1984), our analysis of production risk involves a moment-based approach. We
extend the mean-variance analysis presented in Just
and Pope (1997) and Traxler et al. (1995) by also
examining the third central moment of the relevant
random variables. Under risk aversion, decision makers are adversely affected by a higher variance of returns. And under downside risk aversion, the welfare
of decision makers is positively (negatively) affected
by an increase (decrease) in skewness of returns. This
paper examines the effects of technological change
on the mean, variance and skewness of corn yield and
corn profitability, as they evolve under technological
progress. Relying on Pratt's (1964) risk premium
as a measure of the cost of private risk bearing, we
define technological progress to be risk-increasing
(risk-decreasing) if it increases (decreases) the relative
risk premium. We investigate empirically the trade-off
between risk, measured by both second and third central moments, and expected profit, with a special focus
on the degree of farmers' exposure to downside risk.
The analysis is applied to corn yield and corn
profitability using time series data (1974-1997) from
several research stations in Wisconsin. The panel
structure of the data enables us to investigate the
implications of risk (including downside risk) associated with corn profitability on farmers' welfare over
time and across space. Econometric estimates are
obtained for the first three moments of the distribu-

tion of corn yield, corn moisture and corn profit. The
empirical evidence shows how the trade-off between
expected return and risk has evolved over time and
across sites. Our results indicate that technological
progress has contributed to reducing risk exposure,
although such effects vary across space. They also
stress the importance of relative maturity of corn hybrids as a means of managing production risk. Finally,
they document the role and evolution of downside
risk exposure, and its implications for the cost of
risk.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 3
presents a conceptual framework of decision-making
under risk. Under the expected utility model, we
analyze the effects of technology and input use on
production risk and profitability. We use the properties of the relative risk premium to characterize the
effects of technology on risk exposure. As discussed
in Section 4, we rely on a moment-based approach to
approximate the risk premium. This guides our econometric specification for empirical research shown in
Section 5. The data and application of the model to
corn are discussed in Section 6. Sections 7 and 8
present the empirical analysis. We analyze how the
choice of corn hybrid maturity affects corn yield and
corn profitability, focusing on its effects on expected
value, variance as well as skewness. Corn hybrid maturity is found to have statistically significant effects
on production risk. This implies that the choice of
hybrid maturity is an important risk management tool
for farmers. We also find evidence that technological
change contributes to a significant reduction in risk
exposure through its effects on the variance as well
as skewness of profit. In other words, besides increasing yield, technological progress also lower farmers'
exposure to both risk and downside risk. However,
these effects are found to vary between farm types
and across space. Finally, concluding remarks are
presented in Section 9.

2. Conceptual framework
Consider a farm producing Y = (Y1, Y2, ... , Y17 ),
a vector of outputs under uncertainty. Under technology t, farm production of output Yi is represented by
the stochastic functions Yi = A; · y;(x;, t, e), where
Ai is the acreage of the ith commodity, y;(x;, t, e) is

K. Kim, J.-P. Chavas/Agricultural Economics 29 (2003) 125-142

the corresponding production per acre, xi is a vector
of inputs used to produce y;, and e is a vector of
stochastic factors that are not known to the decision
maker at the time when the input decisions are made.
The vector of stochastic factors e is treated as a random variable with a given probability distribution G.
The vector e includes unpredictable weather effects
as well as the effects of pest and diseases on farm
production. Similarly, under technology t, farm production cost in producing the ith commodity is represented by the stochastic function (A; · C;(x;, t, e)),
where C;(x;, t, e) is the cost per acre, depending of
input choices x;, technology t, and production uncertainty e. Note that this allows cost to depend directly
on yield, e.g. C; = c;(y;(x;, t, e), x;, t, e). Examples
of ex-post costs that vary with output include storage
cost and drying cost. By denoting p; the price of output Y;, total profit associated with farm activities Y is:

variable n by its expected value E(n). It is a monetary
measure of the implicit cost of private risk bearing.
In this context, for non-degenerate risk, risk aversion
implies that R > 0, i.e. that the decision maker always prefers a riskless world. This corresponds to a
concave utility function: a2 u I an 2 < 0 (Pratt, 1964 ).
From Eq. (2), maximizing expected utility is
equivalent to maximizing the certainty equivalent,
E[n(x, t, ·)]- R(x, t). In general, the certainty equivalent, E[n(x, t, ·)]- R(x, t), depends on input use x
and technology t. Of particular interest are the effects
of input use x and technology t on risk exposure. An
input x is said to be risk-increasing (risk-decreasing)
if aR(x, t) jax > 0 ( <0), i.e. if it increases (decreases)
the cost of private risk bearing (e.g. Ramaswami,
1992). Assuming an interior solution, and using the
first-order necessary condition a[E(n) - R]jax = 0,
this can be expressed equivalently through the effects
on the relative risk premium: R(x, t) j[E(n(x, t, ·)) R(x, t)]. In other words, at the optimum, input x is
risk-increasing (risk-decreasing) if it tends to increase
(decrease) the relative risk premium:

where A denotes total acreage available for farm production. The price of output, Pi, can also introduce
a stochastic market environment in the analysis. This
allows for price and weather uncertainty, as well as
technology effects in production decisions. Assume
that inputs are chosen to maximise the expect utility
of profit EU(n), where E is the expectation operator
based on the information available at the time decisions are made. The von Neumann-Morgenstern
utility function U(n) represents the risk preferences
of the decision maker, with auI an > 0. Then, we can
characterize farm decision-making by the optimization problem: Max{EU(n)}, where profit n is given
in Eq. (1). The cost of private risk bearing can be
measured by the sure amount R satisfying:

where [E(n) - R] is the certainty equivalent of profit
(Pratt, 1964). The valueR defined in Eq. (2) is the risk

decision maker is willing to pay to replace the random

In a similar fashion, we propose to investigate the

Assuming that E(n) > 0, E(n) - R > 0, and R >
0, this definition implies that technological progress is
risk-increasing (risk-decreasing) if a ln[R(x, t)]jat >

tends to increase the risk premium relatively more
(less) than expected return. Note that this characterization of linkages between technology and risk
exposure depends on risk preferences as they influence the cost of private risk bearing R. This suggests
a need to assess the risk premium R.

3. Empirical implementation
While R can always be obtained as an implicit
solution to Eq. (2), this requires knowing both the
utility function U(rr) and the probability distribution
of n:. Obtaining such empirical information can be
challenging. Two options are available: (1) obtain
parametric estimates of the probability function of
n:; or (2) estimate the moments of n. The first option involves specifying a functional form for the
probability function and estimating it by the maximum likelihood method. The choice of functional
form includes standard distributions (such as normal,
beta, gamma) as well as transformations of standard distributions. Several transformations have been
applied in the literature, including the inverse hyperbolic sin (e.g. Moss and Shonkwiler, 1993; Ramirez,
1997) and the hyperbolic tangent (e.g. Taylor, 1984;
Ramaswami, 1992). One problem with these approaches is that choosing the functional form is not
always obvious. On the one hand, if one knew the
functional form for sure, then maximum likelihood
estimation would provide consistent and asymptotically efficient parameter estimates. On the other hand,
if the functional form is not the 'true one', then the
model would be mis-specified generating inconsistent
parameter estimates. Given that we often have weak a
priori information about the true shape of a probability function, the issue of mis-specification bias can be
important.
One alternative approach is to proceed by estimating the moments of the random variable n:. There has
been much empirical research focusing on estimating
the first two central moments: the mean and the variance. Situations in which production decisions affect
risk exposure imply heteroscedasticity as the variance
of profit is expected to vary with input choice. A common approach has been to use the Just-Pope specification for estimating the first two moments (e.g. Just and
Pope, 1997; Traxler et al., 1995). However, it is possible to go beyond a mean-variance analysis. As shown
by Antle (1983, 1987) and Antle and Goodger (1984),
consistent estimates of all relevant central moments
can be obtained econometrically. This allows the investigation of the mean, variance as well as higher
moments (e.g. the skewness associated with downside
risk exposure). This is the approach we follow in this
paper.

Once the riskiness of profit n: is assessed, understanding its implications for the cost of private risk
bearing requires information about risk preferences.
Using a moment based-approach, it will be convenient
to rely on an approximation to the risk premium R.
Under differentiability, take a first-order Taylor series
expansion on the right-hand side of Eq. (2) with respect to R, and a mth order Taylor series expansion
on the left-hand side of Eq. (2) with respect to n:. As
shown by Antle (1987), this gives the following approximation to the risk premium R:

J.

where u 1 = (aiu;an:i)(E(n:)) is the jth derivative
of U with respect to profit rr, evaluated at E(n:), j =
1, ... , m, m :::: 2. Note that E[n:- E(n:)]i is the jth
central moment of n:. Thus, expression (3) provides an
approximate measure of the risk premium as a function of the first m moments of profit. When m = 2,
this gives the approximation obtained by Pratt, where
the risk premium is proportional to the variance of
n. Under risk neutrality, the utility function U(n:) is
linear, the risk premium R is zero, and maximizing
Eq. (2) reduces to maximizing the sum of expected
profit. However, risk aversion means that a2 u;an: 2 <
0 (Pratt, 1964). Then, Eq. (3) implies that the risk premium R increases with the variance of profit. Below,
we will consider the case where m = 3. Going beyond
the variance, this includes the effects of skewness
or downside risk exposure on the risk premium. As
shown by Antle (1987), downside risk aversion means
that a3 u;alf 3 > 0, implying that the third central moment becomes relevant: decision-makers prefer a positive skewness as it reduces their exposure to downside
risk.
The model just presented is quite general: it includes
multiple sources of uncertainty associated with different outputs. However, in this paper, we focus on the
uncertainty associated with a particular output (corn).
For this purpose, assume that corn corresponds to the
first commodity (i = 1). Let

This section discusses the econometric specification used below in our empirical investigation of the
distribution of com yield, moisture and profit. Let
/1-JJT(xl, t) = Exr(xl, t, e) denote the mean profit or
first moment of profit per acre of the first commodity.
And let /1-jrr(XI, t) = E[(:7rJ(XI, t, e)- /1-JJT(XI, t))i]
be the jth central moment of :7rJ, j = 2, ... , m, conditional on input decisions xr and on technology t.
Eq. (4) shows how the certainty equivalent of profit depends on the mean profit f.J-lrr (x 1, t), on the variance of
profit, f.J-2rr (x 1, t), on the skewness of profit f.i-3JT (x 1, t),
etc. and on other interaction effects across activities.
This suggests a need to estimate the moments of profit
11- Jrr(XI, t), j = 1, 2, ... , 3. For that purpose, we specify a parametric form for each 11- Jrr and estimate the
corresponding parameters. Let 11- )JT = fJ(xi, t, fi ).
where fi J is a vector of parameters. Then, consider the
econometric model:
(5)

where VIJT is an error term distributed with mean zero,
E(vrJT) = 0. Then, treating (XJ, t) as exogenous variables, Eq. (5) represents a standard regression model
where the parameters fi 1 can be consistently estimated
by the least squares method. Let fiTs be the least
squares estimator of fir in Eq. (5), giving the least
squares residual v}:~ = 7rl - !I (x 1, t, fiTs). Consider
the following model specification:

(6)
Then, the least squares estimation of Eq. (6) gives fi~,
a consistent estimator of fi2 (Antle, 1983). It follows
thatfz(xl, t, fi~) is a consistent estimator of Var(VJrr ).
In the presence of heteroscedasticity, this provides a
basis for re-estimating Eq. (5) by generalized least
squares. The resulting estimator fi?LS is consistent,
asymptotically efficient, and asymptotically normal.
This provides the estimator of expected profit reported

Since
that the least squares estimator of Pj in Eq. (6') is consistent and asymptotically normal for j ~ 2 (Antle,
1983; Antle and Goodger, 1984). However, noting that
Var(Vjrr) = /2j- (/j) 2, the standard errors of pj need
to be corrected for heteroscedasticity. For that purpose, we implement the procedure proposed by White
(1980) to obtain consistent estimates of the standard
errors of Pj in Eq. (6'). This provides the empirical
framework used below in the investigation of the distribution of profit (measured through its mean, variance and skewness) as it changes with technology t
and the input choices x 1·
Farm profit n1 is a function of input choice x 1,
technology t, and uncertainty e. As indicated in
Eq. (1), it will be of interest to decompose the effects
of (x 1, t, e) on farm profit n1 into two main effects:
(1) production effects through the production function Y1 (x 1, t, e); and (2) cost effects through the cost
function C1(x1, t, e). 2 Both functions are stochastic
because they depend on the random variables e. Following the moment-based approach, they can each
be represented by their central moments: mean, variance, skewness, etc. The empirical analysis of these
moments can be conducted in a way similar to the
approach just discussed for the profit function. For
example, the central moments of the production function Y1 (x 1, t, e) can be parameterized as E (y 1) =
f.L1y = g1(x1, t,a1) for the expected value of yield
2
'
E[(Y1 - f.L1y) ] = f.L2y = g2(x1, t, a2) for the variance of yield, E[(Y1 - f.L1y) 3 ] = f.L3y = g3 (x1, t, a3)
for the skewness of yield, etc. Following the estimation method discussed above, the parameters of the
functions gj(X1, t, «j), j = 1, 2, ... , can be consistently estimated. Similarly, the central moments
of the function C 1(x 1, t, e) can be parameterized
as E(C1) = f.L1c = h1(x1, t, y 1) for expected cost,
E[(C1 - f.Llc) 2] = f.L2c = h2(x1, t, y 2) for the variance of cost, E[(C1 - f.L1c) 3] = f.L3c = h3(x1, t, y 3)
for the skewness of cost, etc. Again, the parameters
2 For simplicity, we focus our attention on production and cost
uncertainty. This neglects the possible effects of price uncertainty.
Incorporating price risk into the analysis would be straightforward.

5. An application to corn
We apply the conceptual framework developed in
the previous sections to com production, with a focus on the risk implications of production uncertainty.
In particular, we examine the effects of technology
and climate change at the edge of Corn Belt. First,
Mendelsohn et al. (1994) has argued that the effects
of climatic change are expected to be more significant
in marginal areas around the Com Belt. Second, characterizing the implications of technological change at
the edge of the Com Belt allows us to examine the differential effects of technological change on com production over space.
Our analysis relies on com production and cost data
obtained from three research stations in Wisconsin:
Arlington, Marshfield and Spooner. The Arlington research station is in Southern Wisconsin, Spooner is
in Northern Wisconsin, while Marshfield is in Central Wisconsin. The Arlington station is located in the
Northern Corn Belt. As such, the data from Arlington provide information on the effects of technology
and climatic changes on com production and costs in
the Corn Belt. In contrast, Marshfield and Spooner are
outside the Corn Belt. This means that the data from
Marshfield and Spooner provide useful information on
technology and climate effects in more marginal areas
for corn production.
As one moves north in Wisconsin, corn yields decline as the growing season gets shorter. To deal with
this shorter growing season, farmers in Northern Wisconsin plant short-season corn hybrids for at least two
reasons: (1) they give a higher probability of reaching
maturity before the end of the growing season; and
(2) they require lower drying costs. These trade-offs
are evaluated below. The data set consists of 24 years
(1974-1997) of yield and relative maturity 3 (RM) information generated from long-term studies of corn
yields conducted by the University of Wisconsin Agricultural Experiment Station. These agronomic trial
3 Corn relative maturity is measured using the 'Minnesota relative maturity rating', a standardized index characterizing the number of days it typically takes a corn hybrid to reach maturity.

studies were designed to measure com hybrid performance. They measured yield and grain moisture for a
range of com hybrids. Because other inputs (including
cultural practices) were uniformly administrated during the experiment at each site, yield variations in each
location are mainly due to the choice of hybrid maturity, genetic improvements and uncontrollable factors (mainly weather effects). This provides a basis
for evaluating the evolution of the distribution of corn
yield and cost over time and across space.
Table 1 summarizes the data for the three research
stations. Number of observations (N), average growing degree days (GDD)4 and its standard deviation,
average yield (bushel/acre), average corn moisture at
harvest (%) and the range of RM for each location are
presented. As expected, as one moves north, average
GDD declines. Below, we will examine the evolution
of GDD as a proxy measure of climate change. The
average yield over the sample period decreases as one
moves north. Relative maturity ranges from 85 to 120
in the south, and from 70 to 110 in the north, reflecting the different climatic conditions.

6. Estimation results
Focusing on the first three central moments of the
distribution of corn yield, com moisture, GDD and
4 GDD is a temperature-based index commonly used as a summary measure of the length of the growing season for com. For
example, for a given location and growing season, the GDD index
for com is defined as

GDD =

L. ~[max(Tmini•
50)+ min(Tmaxi• 86)]- 50,

'

where Tmini (Tmaxi) is the minimal (maximal) temperature on day
i (in °F). It reflects the absence of appreciable com growth for
temperatures below 50 or above 86°F.

corn profit, this section presents an empirical investigation of (i) the determinants of the distribution of
corn yield, (ii) the distribution of GDD and its trend,
(iii) the factors affecting the moisture of corn grain at
harvest, and (iv) the distribution of corn profit and its
evolution (both over time and across space).

6.1. Mean, variance and skewness of corn yield
As discussed in Section 4, we estimate the factors
influencing the mean, variance and skewness of com
yield. First, we consider the stochastic production
function representing corn yield, YI = 81 (xi, t, a1) +
VJy, where VJy is an error term distributed with mean
zero. We consider two specifications. In the first
(Model I), we let XI = (RM, RM2 , T): yield is a
linear function of RM, RM2 , and a time trend T. The
introduction of RM 2 allows for possible non-linear
relationship between relative maturity and corn yield.
The time trend T captures two effects, the impact of
technological change (e.g. genetic progress) 5 on yield
(Cardwell, 1982), and the impact of weather change
(Baker et al., 1993; Mendelsohn et al., 1994). The error term VIy accounts for unobserved weather effects
and other uncontrollable factors affecting corn yield.
Note that this specification corresponds to an ex ante
analysis. It reflects the situation in which weather information is not known to farmers at planting time. In
contrast, our second specification (Model II) attempts
5 More informative measures of technology can possibly replace
time trend. For example, genetic improvements can be directly
measured by different hybrids applied. However, this is not included in our analysis because the number of hybrids is very large
and the hybrids change over time in our data. For example, some
of the hybrids used in the early part of the sample are no longer
present in the later part. This makes it difficult to find any simple way of incorporating the hybrid information in our analysis
beyond their RM rating.

to untangle weather effects from technological change
by including GDD in g1 (·).Note that this specification
is consistent with an ex-post analysis since, for a given
year, information on GDD becomes known to farmers
only at harvest time.
Second, we consider the variance of yield: f..L2y =
g2(x1, t, a2) + V2y· We specify and estimate the variance of corn yield as a linear function of RM and T.
Third, we investigate the skewness of yield: f..L3y =
g3(x1, t, a3) + V3y· This function is estimated using
a linear specification with RM and a time trend T as
explanatory variables.
The econometric results are reported in Table 2.
From Table 2(A), the coefficient estimates in the expected yield equations (Model I and Model II) have
anticipated signs and a high level of significance. First,
the coefficients associated with RM are all statistically
significant for both specifications. In all three sites, we
find a positive and concave relationship between relative maturity and corn yield: long season hybrids tend
to produce higher expected yield. Second, for both
specifications, the coefficients of time trend T are all
statistically significant at the 1% level. The positive
signs of the coefficients indicate that expected corn
yield increases over time. In both models, the magnitude of the time trend effects increases as one moves
north. This identifies spatial heterogeneity in the effects of technology and climate changes on expected
corn yield. As discussed above, Model I presents an ex
ante analysis, where the time trend T captures the joint
effects of weather change and productivity growth.
In contrast, Model II presents an ex-post analysis,
conditional on GDD information. This allows separate estimates of the effects of weather change versus
technological progress. Indeed, to the extent that
GDD captures the effects of weather change in Model
II, the time trend T would then capture the effects of
technological change. Table 2 shows that the inclusion
of GDD does not alter significantly the magnitude
of the estimated coefficients for time trend variable
T. This indicates that productivity growth dominates
the effects of weather change. Also, it suggests that
the time trend variable T in the ex ante specification
(Model I) captures mostly the effects of technological change. This issue is further explored in the next
section. In the following, we rely on an ex ante framework for estimating and evaluating three moments of
yield, moisture and profit associated with corn pro-

133

duction. This reflects the fact that, at planting time,
the farmer makes decisions without knowing the production shocks that will become revealed during the
growing season (e.g. rainfall, diseases, frosts, etc.). 6
Table 2(B) reports estimation results for the variance of yield. The fairly low R 2 value suggests that
a large part of the variance remains unexplained.
However, the variance of yield tends to increase over
time. While not significant in Arlington, this effect
becomes positive and significant as one moves north.
This suggests that technological and climatic changes
have increased production risk for corn at the edge of
the Corn Belt (but possibly not within the Corn Belt).
The estimation results for the skewness of yield is
reported in Table 2(C). We found no evidence of statistically significant relationship between relative maturity and the skewness of yield. While the choice of
relative maturity is relevant in dealing with production
risk (as measured by the variance of yield), it suggests
that RM choice does not affect exposure to downside
yield uncertainty. At Arlington, positive and significant time trend suggests that technology and climate
changes tend to increase the skewness of yield. This
implies that exposure to downside yield risk has declined over time at Arlington. However, these effects
are not statistically significant outside the Corn Belt
(Marshfield and Spooner).
Next, we investigate the nature of the exposure to
downside yield risk. For that purpose, we tested the
null hypothesis that the yield distribution is symmetric, using a Wald statistic. The skewness coefficient
measuring symmetry of the distribution is defined as
s 1 = (!3) 2 1(f2) 3 , where .fi is the ith central moment
of yield (Greene, 1993, p. 310). Under the null hypothesis of symmetry (s 1 = 0), the test statistic W =
N. (sV6) is distributed x2 (1). We tested for symmetry
at each site for different values of RM and at different
time periods. For Arlington and Marshfield, the test
results imply that, in most cases, the null hypothesis of
symmetry is rejected at the 5% significance level. The
test results then provide evidence that the distribution

6 An ex post approach evaluating the yield effects of weather
patterns during the growing season is of interest from an agronomic
viewpoint. However, it would involve estimating weather effects
that are not known to the farmer at planting time. Below, we focus
our analysis on ex ante analysis relating the probability distribution
of yield to factors that are known to the farmer at planting time.

134

of yield is skewed to the left (corresponding to a significant exposure to downside risk) in Arlington and
Marshfield. As one moves north (Spooner), the null
is rejected regardless of the maturity length of corn
hybrids. Thus, in general, we find evidence that the
distribution of yield is skewed to the left, implying a
significant exposure to downside yield risk. However,
one exception is at Arlington, where we failed to reject the null for medium-season hybrids in the 1990s,
while we rejected the null for the same hybrids in the
1970s and the 1980s. This indicates that yield skewness has changed and that the exposure to downside
risk has declined over time in Arlington.
6.2. Technological change versus climatic change

The estimation results discussed in the previous
section show some significant increases in the mean,
variance and skewness of yield over time. The joint effects of technology and climate changes on the mean,
variance and skewness of corn yield (captured by the
time trend 1), appear to vary across sites. Contrasting
Model I and Model II in Table 2(A), we have found
some evidence that most of the effects captured by the
time trend are due to technological change. Below,
we provide some additional evidence on this issue.
We consider the evolution of the distributions of
GDD at each site. Since GDD is a temperature-based
index providing a summary measure of the length of
the growing season for corn, we use it as a proxy
for climate change. Using the moment-based approach
discussed in Section 4, the mean, variance and skewness of GDD are estimated as linear functions of a
time trend. The results are presented in Table 3. As indicated in Table 3(A), the coefficient of the time trend
T in mean GDD equation is positive and statistically
significant for Marshfield. However, it is not statistically significant for Arlington and Spooner. Thus, for
Arlington and Spooner, there is no strong evidence of
a longer growing season (as measured by GDD). For
these stations, this weak evidence of global warming
effects suggests that most of the yield trends could be
attributed to technological change. For Marshfield, we
find strong evidence of a longer growing season. This
is consistent with beneficial effects of global warming in the northern fringe of the US (Mendelsohn
et al., 1994; NOAA, 2000). On the other hand, as indicated in Table 2(A), we also find strong evidence of

joint effects of technology and climate changes on productivity gain. Then, how much of productivity gain
at Marshfield can be attributed to technological improvement? Compared with the annual yield increase
of +1.87bushel/acre per year (+1.13% per year), an
increase of +0.42% per year in the growing season
(associated with an average annual increase in GDD of
11.45 °F) is reported in Table 3(A). To the extent that
GDD increases are expected to generate proportional
changes in expected corn yield, this suggests that about
37% of productivity gain in Marshfield would be attributed to a longer growing season. This would suggest that 63% of productivity gain may be associated
with technological change. In a way consistent with
Thompson (1975, 1988) and Cardwell (1982), this indicates that only a small proportion of yield trend can
be attributed to evolving weather patterns. 7 Thus, for
all three sites, technological progress seems the dominant factor influencing productivity trends in corn production.
Next, we evaluate the impact of climatic change
on production risk (as measured by the variance of
corn yield). Table 3(B) reports that the coefficient of
the time trend T in the variance of GDD equation is
positive and statistically significant for Arlington and
Marshfield. This suggests that the growing season
has become more unpredictable at these locations.
However, the time trend effect is not statistically
significant at Spooner. Thus, at Spooner, there is no
strong evidence that the length of the growing season
has become more unpredictable. This suggests that,
at the edge of the Corn Belt, it is not clear whether
global warming is contributing to increased corn yield
uncertainty. Yet, significant increases in yield risk
have been reported in Table 2(B) for Spooner. To the
extent that they are not associated with climatic fluctuations, these changes can be attributed to changing
technology. This indicates that, along with higher
expected yields, improved technologies also bring an
increased exposure to production risk (e.g. improved
7 Additional evidence is obtained by introducing the GDD variable (as a proxy for climate change) in the expected yield equation
reported in Table 2A. After introducing GDD, the estimated coefficients for the time trend variable T became 1.882, 1.987 and
2.208 for Arlington, Marshfield and Spooner, respectively. These
estimates are very close to the ones reported in Table 2A. This indicates that the time trend variable T primarily captures the effects
of technological change.

short-season hybrids with better average yield but
more sensitivity to weather shocks). In contrast, in the
Corn Belt (Arlington), we find a significant increase in
the unpredictability of the length of the growing season. Yet, as indicated in Table 2(B), there is no statistical evidence that the variance of yield has increased
over time in Arlington. These two findings suggest that
technological progress in Arlington has contributed
to reducing exposure to production risk in the Corn
Belt. This shows that technological progress interacts
with production risk in different ways across regions.
Finally, we inquire about the effects of climatic
change on exposure to downside production risk. This
involves an investigation of the skewness of GDD. As
indicated in Table 3(C), we find no statistical evidence
that the skewness of GDD has changed over time. To
the extent that the time trend captures climate change,
this suggests that the impact of climate change on exposure to downside risk remains unchanged. Yet, we
found statistically significant increase in the skewness
of corn yield at Arlington. We interpret this to mean
that, at Arlington, most of the reduction in downside
risk can be attributed to technological progress (e.g.
due to new hybrids that are more resistant to pests and
diseases). In all cases, we conclude that technological
progress seems to be the dominant factor influencing
the evolving distribution of corn yield.

6.3. Mean, variance and skewness of corn moisture
This section explores corn grain moisture at harvest. Since the cost of drying depends on the moisture of corn grain at harvest, we examine the factors
affecting the uncertainty involved in drying cost. Expected moisture, variance of moisture, and skewness
of moisture are specified and estimated. The estimation results are reported in Table 4 for each site.
Mean, variance and skewness of moisture equations
are specified as a linear function of relative maturity RM and a time trend T. Including a time trend
allows us to examine the effects of technology and
climatic changes on the evolution of moisture over
time.
As indicated in Table 4(A), the effects of RM on
mean corn grain moisture are positive and become
significant as one moves north. The variance of moisture also exhibits a positive relationship with RM,
suggesting that the risk associated with the unpredictability of corn grain moisture increases with corn
hybrid maturity. This relationship seems to become
more important as one moves north. As indicated
in Table 4(C), we find strong evidence of a statistically significant and positive relationship between
RM and the skewness of corn moisture at Arlington
and Marshfield. This suggests that planting a longer

season com hybrid increases the odds of facing high
moisture com at harvest time.
Next, we evaluate the evolution of the distribution of
corn grain moisture. First, at Arlington, the coefficient
of the time trend in the expected moisture equation is
positive and statistically significant. This means that
technological progress and climatic change tend to increase expected moisture, thereby increasing drying
costs. With no evidence of changes in climatic trend
(Table 3(A)), this suggests that most of these effects
can be attributed to technological progress at Arlington. However, as indicated by the statistically significant and negative relationship between time trend and
the skewness of moisture (Table 4(C)), technological
progress contributes to lowering the odds of facing
high moisture corn at harvest (which would reduce
drying cost). At Marshfield and Spooner, we find no
strong evidence of time trend effects on either expected
moisture or skewness of moisture. However, note that
these sites show statistically significant relationships
between time trend and the variance of moisture.
6.4. Mean, variance and skewness of corn profit
Finally, we explore the implications of technology and uncertainty on corn profit. We measure com
profit as corn revenue minus drying cost on a per acre

basis. The corn price is assumed to be US$ 2.00 per
bushel. 8 The drying cost varies depending on corn
moisture at harvest as well as farm type. We consider
three farm types: a livestock farm where corn is fed
directly to livestock with no drying; a grain farm
using on-farm drying facilities; and a grain farm relying on commercial drying. 9 The expected value of
profit, its variance and its skewness are specified and
estimated as discussed in Section 4. The econometric
results are presented in Table 5. Table 5(A) summarizes the estimation results for expected income by
farm type and by location (Arlington, Marshfield and
Spooner). The results are consistent with those obtained in the analysis of expected yield (see Table 2
and the associated discussion). For example, the coefficients associated with relative maturity RM and
time trend Tare statistically significant (except RM2
8 Thus, the analysis presented here neglects price uncertainty.
The sensitivity of our results to price changes was evaluated.
While higher corn prices increase corn profitability, the empirical
findings presented below were found to be fairly robust.
9 On a livestock farm, drying cost are zero and corn moisture
variations have no impact on income. In contrast, corn drying affects cost under commercial drying, with a drying cost of 0.03 cent
per bushel per percentage moisture in excess of 15.5%. On-farm
drying represents an intermediate situation, with a drying cost of
0.015% per bushel per percentage moisture in excess of 15.5%.

at Arlington for a livestock farm) and have expected
signs. They indicate that technological change has
contributed to increases in expected corn profitability
over time, with the rate of increase being faster as
one moves north. However, the patterns of variance in
corn profitability become more complex. For example, it is only in Northern Wisconsin (Spooner) that
profit risk increases significantly over time for all farm
types. The rate of increase is largest for farms using

commercial drying, and smallest for livestock farms.
In the other locations, the results vary across farms
types, indicating the significant role of drying cost.
Using the econometric results presented in
Table 5(A), we evaluated the RM value that maximizes expected profit. This corresponds to a risk
neutral scenario. At Arlington the optimal RM equals
125.9 for the livestock farm, 110.9 for on-farm drying, and 98.7 for commercial drying. These values

138

are 96.0, 90.1 and 84.9 at Marshfield, and 89.0, 87.3
and 85.3 at Spooner, respectively for livestock farm,
on-farm drying and commercial drying. This shows
that, as one moves north, the drying cost effects are
important, and maximum expected profit is achieved
at lower value of RM. These results indicate that, under commercial drying, switching to lower maturity
rating provides farmers an opportunity to reduce their
drying cost and to increase expected profit.
Next, we evaluate the farmer's risk exposure.
Table 5(B) reports statistically significant and positive
relationship between the variance of profit and relative maturity RM. This suggests a trade-off between
expected profit and the variance of profit. Table 5(C)
shows no significant RM effects on the skewness of
profit. This suggests that RM is not an effective means
of controlling downside risk. Yet, a Wald test statistic suggests that, in general, the distribution of corn
profit is not symmetrically distributed. For example,
at Arlington and Spooner relative skewness values
indicate that the distribution of profit is skewed to the
left, implying the presence of a significant exposure
to downside risk. However, in Arlington, we find that
the exposure to downside risk has decreased over
time.

7. Economic implications
This section discusses the economic implications of
our econometric estimates. First, we explore whether
relative maturity is a risk-increasing or risk-decreasing
input. We also investigate the relationships between
technological progress and risk exposure. Second, we
examine the relationship between expected corn profit
and the cost of risk (as measured by the risk premium),
and its evolution over time and across space. Finally,
we decompose the risk premium into two parts: one
due to the second moment and the other due to the third
moment of corn profit. This provides some insights
on the relative role of variance versus downside risk
exposure (as captured by the third moment) in the
evaluation of the cost of risk.

7.1. Technology, relative maturity and risk
The cost of private risk bearing was defined by the
risk premium R in Eq. (2) and approximated by Eq. (3)

or Eq. (3'). From Eq. (3'), the risk premium per acre
of corn can be approximated by

where {L jn is the jth central moment of corn profit per
acre n1, j 2: 2. 10 Expression (7) shows that the risk
premium depends on the first m moments of n 1 as
well as risk preferences U. We have information about
the first three central moments of n 1 (see Table 5). To
make use of Eq. (7) to evaluate the cost of risk, we need
to know the decision maker's risk preferences. Below,
we present results obtained assuming that the decision maker's risk preferences exhibit constant relative
risk aversion (CRRA), with utility function U(n) =
n 1-A when (1- A) > 0, and U(n) = -n 1-A when
(1- A) < 0, A > 0 being the relative risk aversion coefficient (Pratt, 1964). Note that this is consistent with
risk aversion (U 2 < 0), decreasing absolute risk aversion (see Pratt, 1964), as well as downside risk aversion (U 3 > 0). Given the empirical evidence that most
farmers are risk averse (Lin et al., 1974; Binswanger,
1981; Antle, 1987; Saha et al., 1994) as well as downside risk averse (e.g. Binswanger, 1981; Chavas and
Holt, 1996), this risk preference specification seems
reasonable. For the purpose of illustration, the results
presented below correspond to a CRRA coefficient
A= 2_11
Using the approximate risk premium given in
Eq. (7), we first examine the relationship between
RM and the cost of risk. Evaluated at 1997, we calculated the change in the risk premium R 1 due to
a change in RM. We found that, regardless of sites
and farm types, the risk premium R 1 increased with a
longer maturity corn hybrid. This implies that relative
maturity is a risk-increasing input: a longer relative
maturity involves a higher cost of risk.

10 Note that Eq. (7) ignores interactions with other production
activities. Such interactions would be relevant at the farm level.
However, given our focus on com production, they are neglected
in the analysis presented below.
11 A sensitivity analysis was conducted on the relative risk aversion coefficient A. We investigated the following scenarios: A= 1,
2, 3, 6. Although the quantitative results varied depending on the
choice of A, we found fairly similar qualitative results across scenarios.

K. Kim, J.-P. Chavas/Agricultural Economics 29 (2003) 125-142

In a similar fashion, we explored the relationship between technological change and risk. In Section 3, we
defined technological progress to be risk-increasing
(or risk-decreasing) depending on its impact on the
relative risk premium. We used expression (7) to evaluate the relative risk premium comparing 1975 with
1994, for each location and each farm type. With one
exception (commercial farm in Spooner), we found
that the relative risk premium was lower in 1995 than
in 1975. We interpret this as strong evidence that technological progress has been risk-decreasing. This is
consistent with the results reported in Table 5.
Next, we examine whether these findings are statistically meaningful. First, we tested the null hypothesis that RM input has no effect on the risk
premium. This is done by calculating the change in
the risk premium due to a change in RM, and bootstrapping its distribution. The null hypothesis that
RM has no effect on the risk premium was tested for
each farm type and each site. Using a 5% significance level, we strongly rejected the null hypothesis
for each farm type at Arlington as well as Spooner.
This provides statistical evidence that choosing a
lower RM is a risk-reducing strategy. At Marshfield,
we also rejected the null hypothesis for on-farm
storage and commercial farm. Again, this provides
evidence that short season hybrids generate a lower
risk premium. However, we failed to reject the null
hypothesis for the livestock farm at Marshfield (with
a P-value of 0.197). This shows that risk exposure
varies across sites. It also illustrates the importance
of drying cost in the evaluation of risk management
strategies.
Second, we examined the statistical significance of
the time trend T on the relative risk premium. The
null hypothesis is that the relative risk premium has
not changed over time. Again we used Eq. (7) to
bootstrap the distribution of the change in the relative risk premium between 1975 and 1994. Using a
5% significance level, the null hypothesis is strongly
rejected for all farm types and all RM at Arlington
and Marshfield. We interpret this as strong statistical
evidence that technological progress is risk-reducing
at Arlington and Marshfield. However, the tests results differ for a commercial farm at Spooner. The
P-values were 0.32, 0.779, 0.755 and 0.651 for RM =
70, 75, 80, 90, respectively, indicating that we fail to
reject the null hypothesis at Spooner. This suggests

139

that the linkages between technological change and
risk exposure vary across sites as well as across farm
types.
7.2. Trade-off between expected profit and risk
premium

The trade-offs between expected profit and the
risk premium (obtained from Eq. (7)) are reported
in Fig. la-c by farm type for Arlington, Marshfield
and Spooner, respectively. They summarize the effects of drying cost and technological progress on the
expected profit and risk premium by location and by
farm type. They also show the evolution of the relationship between expected profit and risk premium
between the 1970s and the 1990s. Each point is obtained by changing corn hybrids and their associated
RM ratings (expressed in days). The slope of the lines
shows how expected corn profit and risk premium
relate to each other. For example, the positive slope
of frontier functions indicates that expected income
cannot be increased without also increasing the risk
premium. Alternatively, the risk premium cannot be
reduced without sacrificing expected income.
In the Corn Belt (represented by the Arlington site),
the growing season is longer. Each farm type exhibits
a different slope of its frontier function. For example,
the livestock farm shows relatively large trade-off between expected return and risk premium, whereas the
trade-off is less pronounced under commercial drying.
This means that, under commercial drying, the risk
premium can be reduced without much reduction in
expected profit by choosing hybrids with lower relative maturity RM. The relationship indicates that technological progress has allowed farmers to significantly
reduce their risk premium without much reduction in
expected return.
In contrast, under a short growing season, Spooner
(in Northern Wisconsin) shows different linkages between technological change and the trade-off between
risk premium and expected return. There, technological progress has not allowed farmers to reduce their
risk premium without significant reduction in expected
return. Finally, the results obtained in Central Wisconsin (Marshfield) are intermediate between the other
two sites. The risk premium trade-off is not as pronounced as in the north, but more pronounced than in
the south.

Finally, it is instructive to use Eq. (7) to decompose
the risk premium into two components: the part due
to variance, and the part due to skewness. For all sites
and all farm types, we find that a large part of the risk
premium is attributed to second moment effects. For
example, on commercial farms in Arlington, the variance effects vary from 67% (when RM = 85) to 91%
(when RM = 120) of the risk premium. In addition,
in Arlington (where the growing season is longer),
while lower relative maturity RM significantly reduces
the cost of risk due to variance, it also increases the
cost of risk due to downside risk exposure. Over time,
the exposure to both variance and downside risk decreases, especially for a commercial farm. This suggests that technological progress has contributed to
reducing risk associated with the unpredictability of
com grain moisture. For the other two farm types, risk
improvements also exist, but they are smaller.
Interestingly, under a short growing season, Spooner
(in Northern Wisconsin) shows different evolution patterns of second and third moment effects. There, technology apparently weakens the ability to manage risk
(especially downside risk) orcommercial farms (where
drying cost significantly affect the variability of com
profit). As one moves north, the third moment effects
become relatively more important in the evaluation of
the cost of risk. This illustrates the complex interactions between technological progress and risk exposure over space.

Northern Wisconsin. But our results also show that, in
Southern Wisconsin (in the Corn Belt), these changes
have increased the skewness of corn yield and contributed to reducing exposure to downside risk and
to lowering the cost of risk. While we found some
evidence of climatic change, its effects appear to be
dominated by the impact of technological change.
Our findings show that technological progress has
provided improved means of dealing with risk in the
Corn Belt. This can be attributed in part to genetic
improvements targeted to improved pest and disease
resistance. We found strong statistical evidence identifying technological progress to be risk-decreasing:
technological change has contributed to lowering the
relative risk premium over the sample period. However, we emphasize that such benefits are found to
vary across sites.
Our analysis has stressed the role of risk management in corn production. It has emphasized the importance of choosing corn hybrids and their relative
maturity as a means of managing risk. Also, it highlighted the role of technological progress in risk exposure. The analysis of risk premium and expected
profit showed that technology and exposure to risk and
downside risk can interact, and that such effects vary
over space. It illustrated the role of downside risk exposure in the assessment of technological change in
agriculture. Further research is needed to evaluate production uncertainty issues for different commodities
and in different locations.

8. Summary and conclusions
Acknowledgements
This paper has investigated the distribution of com
yield, grain moisture and profit, with a focus on the
effects of technology and climate changes on the evolution of trade-off between com profitability and risk.
It used panel data from Wisconsin research stations,
covering sites from the Corn Belt to the Northern
fringe of the US. Using a moment-based approach,
our empirical analysis examined conditional means,
variances and skewness for corn yield, moisture and
profit in different sites in Wisconsin. It shows how
corn yield, moisture and profit have evolved over time,
and how technology and climate change have affected
them across sites.
We found evidence that technology and climate
changes have increased production risk in Central and
