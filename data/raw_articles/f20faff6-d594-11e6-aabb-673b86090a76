Abstract

This study investigates the role of information in influencing the adoption of improved farm management
practices. A lack of producer information regarding both the profitability and the environmental benefits of adopting
improved practices may be a reason why widespread adoption of these practices has not occurred. Compared to
direct regulation or financial incentives, raising producer information levels may be a more cost-effective method of
increasing adoption. The United States Department of Agriculture has recently established and begun implementing
a program based on this idea. To test the validity of the program, a two-stage adoption model is specified and
estimated using data from a survey of producers in the program area. The results indicate that producer perceptions
play an important role in the decision to adopt. Changing these perceptions by means of an educational program
may be a reasonable alternative to financial incentives in encouraging BMP adoption.

1. Introduction

Best management practices (BMPs) are agronomically sound practices that protect or enhance
water quality and are at least as profitable as
existing practices. Producer ignorance of their
existence and misperceptions of their effect on
farm profitability may result in reduced adoption

rates of these practices. Financial incentives such
as cost sharing or tax exemptions, where the
government 'shares' in the risk of adoption, are
common methods for overcoming adverse perceptions. These types of incentives are costly, especially if adoption depends primarily upon producer perceptions. An alternative is to implement
programs that educate producers. These programs are essentially informational incentives because they encourage adoption by revising producer perceptions about the cost effectiveness of
new farming practices. Although fixed start-up
costs are incurred, informational incentives may
be less costly than financial incentives in the long
run as information spreads throughout the farm
community.

The United States Department of Agriculture
(USDA) has recently implemented a program
based on this premise. The program relies on
several demonstration projects (DPs) located
across the country. Each DP is a geographic area
containing farms practicing one or more BMPs.
The purpose of the program is to encourage
adoption through the demonstration of BMPs to
local producers. The DP program can only be
successful if producers' perceptions are affected
by the presence of DPs, and if these perception
changes lead to increased adoption.
This paper investigates the empirical significance of informational incentives in BMP adoption. The empirical model utilizes data from a
recent adoption survey commissioned by the
USDA to evaluate the DP approach. The first
phase of the survey was conducted in 1991, one
year after the program was initiated (see Nowak
and O'Keefe, 1992). The empirical model allows
for an assessment of how producer perceptions of
risk, profitability, and improvements in environmental quality influence adoption. Additionally,
the sampling design of the survey allows for a
direct comparison of producers under different
levels of influence from the DP, yet sharing similar cropping and livestock characteristics. Differences in behavior across states and geographic
regions are also examined.
In the next section, a model of BMP adoption
is discussed. Instead of categorizing the adoption
process as a single dichotomous choice, the model
treats the decisions of adopting and then employing BMPs as a two-stage process. This allows
BMPs to be utilized in varying intensity levels
once the initial decision to adopt has been made.
Examination of the intensity decision allows for a
more realistic and informative assessment of the
adoption process. Feder et al. (1985, p. 286) point
out that such a two-stage approach is particularly
desirable when dealing with problems such as
fertilizer applications where intensity may vary
widely over individuals who adopt. The following
sections contain a description of the survey data
and empirical model, the estimation results, and
the conclusions of the study.

2. A model of BMP adoption
BMPs are at least as profitable as existing
practices and improve water quality. Given this,
their adoption should depend primarily upon the
producer's perceptions of the BMP's benefits.
Better informed producers are assumed to adopt
BMPs because they are more aware of the benefits. The adoption model can be formalized with
the producer's problem. Consider a firm that
must decide which farming practice to employ.
For simplicity, assume each farming practice is
associated an input, Xi. Let the producer's strictly
concave utility function be given by 1 :

U[1Ti(Xi; y), Qi(Xi; 8);
=aj

U[1Ti(Xi; y);

D]

D]

+(1-aJ V[QJXi; 8); !1]

( 1)

where y and 8 are independent random parameters with distributions fY and f 8, so that '7Ti( ·) is
uncertain farm profit and Qi( ·) is uncertain onfarm environmental quality from adopting the ith
BMP; D represents the producer's socioeconomic
characteristics that can affect adoption, and aj E
[0, 1] is a producer-specific weight attached to
profits and environmental quality. Utilizing the
ith practice involves allocating Xi, the input associated with the practice. Because BMPs considered in the empirical portion of the paper utilize
different inputs (e.g. labor, fertilizer, or consultant fees), Xi is not specifically defined. The
intensity of input usage represents the extent that
the practice is used on the farm. xi is a joint
input in both production and environmental quality 2 . Separability of the utility function accommodates the fact that, for improved farming practices, abatement and crop production are often

1

1t is assumed aU(·)ja1Ti> 0, aU 2 (-)ja1Tp <0, W(-)jaQi

> 0, and W 2 (. )jaQf < 0.
2 For example, consider a BMP which involves allocating
fertilization labor in stages as corn emerges. Here, the single
labor input jointly produces both water quality benefits and
profits, because nitrate infiltration is reduced and productivity
is increased through more timely fertilizer applications.

P.M Feather, G.S. Amacher/ Agricultural Economics 11 (1994) 159-170

separate events, yet are the result of employing
the same input (see Malik and Shoemaker, 1993) 3
Given the benefits associated with the BMPs,
the most important way to encourage adoption is
to reduce the uncertainty surrounding use of the
practice. Accordingly, the purpose of the DPs is
to use information to reduce uncertainties producers have about BMPs. The effect of improved
information is reflected in (1). The random parameters in the utility function represent the producer's uncertainty concerning the adoption of
the ith practice. It is assumed that better informed producers are more confident of a practice's effects on profits and environmental quality, thus reducing their perceived variance of y
and 8. The effect of better information raises
confidence in the benefits of the BMPs and increases adoption.
The profit function in (1) for the ith practice
can be defined further as:

(2)
where P is the output price, w is the input cost,
f/ ·) and X; are the uncertain output and input
requirements resulting from adoption of the ith
practice, C; is a known initial investment cost,
and at(· );ax; ~ o and a2f( · )/ ax?~ 0. Fixed
costs appear in (2) to reflect the possibility that
some practices require initial capital investment
costs that are unique to the adoption decision.
If the expected utility of using the ith practice
exceeds that of the currently used practice (U0 ),
then it is adopted:
aiEY U[ '1T;(X;; y); OJ
+(l-ai)E8 V[Q;(X;; o); OJ~ U0

(3)

where EY (E 8 ) is the expectations operator taken
over y (o). From (3), adoption of a BMP is more

likely whenever initial investment costs are low,
expected increases in environmental quality are
high, or costs and production are such that expected profits increase. If condition (3) holds,
then the producer maximizes (1) subject to (2) to
determine at what intensity the practice is used:
PEY U'(")

[af(X;; y);ax;-w]

+[(1-aJ/(ai)]E8 V'(") [aQ(X;; o);ax;]
=

0

These assumptions are not restrictive. Although the same
input affects both abatement and production, its ultimate
effect is different through the random parameters, because an
input such as labor can cause different expost effects on
profits and environmental quality. While the case y = 13 can
exist, the effects of two types of uncertainty will not in general
be equal. To illustrate a case where y = 13, consider some
practice that incurs far greater labor requirements than the
producer was expecting. Here, use of the practice decreases
both environmental quality and profits.

(4)

If the ith practice is adopted, then the producer determines optimal input use from (4). It is
determined so that the expectation of the product
of marginal utility and marginal profit from using
the practice are equal to the expectation of the
product of marginal utility and marginal benefits
in water quality. As X; increases, input intensity
(either per acre or per farm) increases because
the producer uses the practice more extensively.
Intensity depends positively on price, expected
marginal input productivity, and expected improvement of environmental quality, but negatively on input cost and the variance of y. The
effects of cost and price variables on the adoption
and intensity decisions appear in the Appendix.

3. Estimation and data

To specify the adoption decision, (3) is restated in a random utility framework formalized
by Manski (1973). Individuals are assumed to
always select the alternative with greatest utility,
but since the true function is unknown, it must be
treated as random by the analyst 4 • Restating the
decision to adopt the ith practice given by (3)
under the random utility framework results in:

4 Manski (1973) discusses four sources of randomness: unobserved attributes, unobserved taste variations, measurement
errors, and instrumental variables. These concepts are also
discussed in Ben-Akiva and Lerman (1985, pp. 55-57).

term capturing the investigator's uncertainty regarding the producer's expectations of 'Y and 8.
The correction for censoring consists of calculating a correction term from the probit model and
including it as an independent variable in the
intensity model (see Maddala, 1983).
Data used to estimate the model are taken
from a survey of producer BMP adoption behavior conducted by Nowak and O'Keefe (1992) under partial funding from a USDA cooperative
agreement; 957 completed questionnaires were
obtained from agricultural producers in eight
states (Nebraska, Minnesota, Wisconsin, North
Carolina, Maryland, Texas, California and
Florida). Enough survey information exists to
form testable hypotheses for the adoption patterns of five practices:

where si and s 0 are independently and identically distributed random variables with mean zero
and variance one for all producers. This distributional assumption allows (7) to be estimated using
a bivariate probit model (see Ben-Akiva and Lerman, 1985):

(6)
where P; is the probability that the ith BMP is
adopted, <I>(·) denotes the cumulative normal distribution function, Y; is a vector of variables that
are arguments of (5), and {3 is a vector of parameters to be estimated.
The intensity decision is estimated as a linear
function to approximate condition (3) while accounting for censoring of the data set to include
only producers who have adopted the practice:

Manure crediting. The producer estimates the
amount of nutrients available for crops from applying livestock or poultry manure. The amount
of commercial fertilizer applied is then adjusted
by the amount provided by the manure.

Legume crediting. The producer estimates amount
of nitrogen available for crops from previous
legumes. The amount of commercial fertilizer
applied is then adjusted by the amount of nitrogen provided by the legumes.

Deep soil nitrate nesting. The producer measures
the amount of residual nitrogen in the soil profile. The amount of commercial fertilizer is then
adjusted by the amount of nitrogen in the soil
available for crops.

Split application of nitrogen. The producer applies

the first is the DP area itself, while the other
('comparison' area) lies outside the DP and is
essentially a control. Differences in adoption rates
between DP areas and comparison areas, or between states, can be determined using likelihood
ratio (LR) tests (see Judge et al., 1985). Using the
former as an example, define:

expected cost, profit, risk and environmental impacts associated with each BMP on an ordered
scale was available. These were converted to
dummy variables in order to divide the responses
into high or low expectations for each variable.
Since (3) and (4) rely on the magnitude of producer expectations, these questions serve as suitable proxies for the elements in the theoretical
model.
Table 1 contains a description of the variables
used to estimate the adoption models. Knowledge
of the BMP and the DP measures the producer's
information regarding the practice. Perceptions
of risk measure the producer's confidence in the
benefits of adopting the BMP. Opinions regarding the profitability and labor requirements of
each BMP approximate variables appearing in
(2); anticipated quality changes serve as an indicator of Q; in (1). The importance of these variables in the adoption decision can be determined
using simple t-tests of the parameter estimates.
The corn acreage variable (Corn) describes the
size of the operation. This variable was selected
because a majority of the respondents grow corn,
and the majority of the BMPs involve row cropping practices. Finally, the presence of livestock
is assumed to influence manure crediting.
In each state, two types of areas were sampled:

4. Estimation results and discussion
The first stage of the two-stage model is solely
used to evaluate the adoption of each BMP, with
the exception of split application of nitrogen
which is the only BMP that varies significantly in
intensity 5 . Probit estimates of the first stage of
the adoption models appear in Tables 2-6. Two
'unrestricted' probit models are included for each
practice. The first ('state' model) is used to test
for differences in adoption between states; the
second ('DemojComp' model) is used to test for
differences in adoption between the DP areas
and the comparison areas. The Demo1 Camp
models contain dummy variables for observations
in comparison areas or DP areas; the state models contain dummy variables for each state. These
models will be compared to a model containing a
constant term ('Constant' model) to test for differences in adoption rates. Each Table also contains a column showing the observed adoption
rate in each state and in the DP and comparison
areas.

5 All other practices are usually used at full intensity once
adopted.

Two variables are used to measure producer
informational states: knowledge of the practice
(Prac Aware) and of the demonstration project
(Demo Aware). Both parameters usually have an
anticipated positive sign and are often significant.
This result was expected because information is
assumed to effect the mean and variance of y
and o. By definition, BMPs are at least as profitable as existing practices and improve water
quality. As the producer becomes more informed,
the uncertainty regarding the use of the BMP
decreases and the expectations of y and o may
increase, since the better informed producer views
the practice as more profitable and less polluting.
In contrast, the dummy variable associated with
the assessed riskiness of each practice (Risk) performed poorly in the adoption models. This parameter was expected to be negative because
producers who perceive a practice to be risky
have a higher variance associated with y and will
tend not to adopt.
The anticipated change in profits (Profits) variable is consistently significant and positive in all
of the adoption models. This result reflects condition (3) where adoption occurs if profits are anticipated to increase. Another component in (3),
environmental quality, is positive in four of the

P.M. Feather, G.S. Amacher/ Agricultural Economics 11 (1994) 159-170

five adoption models, but significant in only two
of the models. Comparing the two parameters
across all models reveals that the Profits parameter is larger than the environmental quality (Quality) parameter in the majority of the adoption
models. This may indicate that the adoption decision is driven more by anticipated increases in
profits than by environmental quality. In the theoretical model, expectations regarding the input
requirements of a BMP directly effect intensity at
which it is practiced, but only indirectly effect the
adoption decision via the profit function. Adoption decisions are influenced by perceived profits
and environmental quality. Intensity decisions are
influenced by the allocation of an input according
to (4). The survey contains information about
changes in a single input, labor, associated with
the adoption of each BMP. Although the labor
variable is more appropriate in the intensity model
than the adoption model, it appears in the adoption models mainly because most of the BMPs
are practiced at full intensity once adopted. The
parameter associated with this variable is negative, as anticipated, in four of the five models.
However, the parameter is never significantly different from zero. This suggests that anticipated
labor requirements are less important in the
adoption decision than profits and environmental
quality.
The number of acres used in corn production
is positive and significant in all of the adoption
models. The manure crediting adoption model
contains two additional variables to account for
the presence of beef cattle (Beef) and dairy cattle
(Dairy). Both positively effect adoption rates of
this practice, but only Dairy is significantly different from zero.
Estimation results for the split application of
nitrogen intensity model appear in Table 7. The
dependent variable is the percentage of total corn
acres receiving split applications of nitrogen. To
test for differences in intensity, this model is also
estimated in the 'State' and 'DemojComp' versions. The input variable (Labor) is negative and
significant indicating that producers who find the
practice more labor intensive tend to practice it
at lower intensity. The theoretical model also
predicts that increases in output price (reflected

in the Profits variable) should increase intensity
while increases in the variance of y (reflected in
the Risk variable) should decrease intensity. Although both of these variables were insignificant
in the estimated model, the parameter signs concur with the theoretical model. Finally, the number of acres of corn produced on the farm (Corn)
is highly significant in explaining intensity. As
corn acreage increases, intensity diminishes.
Likelihood ratio statistics for tests of significance between DP and comparison areas appear
in Table 8. The results indicate that significant
differences exist for the adoption and intensity of
split application of nitrogen and the adoption of
legume crediting across DP and comparison areas. No differences are found for the remaining
three BMPs 6 . Inspection of Tables 2-7 reveals
that adoption levels are almost equal across DP
areas and comparison areas for all but these two
BMPs (where adoption levels are higher in the
DP areas).
Test statistics for differences in adoption levels
across states also appear in Table 8. Adoption

adoption rates between Demonstration Areas and Comparison Areas would be rejected at approximately the 13.5% error
level for manure crediting.

rates were found to significantly differ across
states for every practice. The test results, magnitude of differences in state dummy variable parameters, and adoption percentages shown in Tables 2-6 indicate that adoption rates vary much
more across states than across DP and comparison areas. Factors such as the quality of extension
services, output price variations and soil fertility
that vary from state to state, but are not included
in the model, are likely to account for this result.
Differences in the models then arise because
these factors are captured in the state dummy
variables. In order to control for variation between states when testing DP areas versus comparison areas, two models were estimated for
each practice in each state. The first contains a
constant term; the second contains dummy variables for DP areas and comparison areas. Likelihood ratio tests, appearing in Table 9, were then
carried out to determine if the two models differ
(individual models are not reported). The results
show that few significant differences in adoption
rates exist between DP and comparison areas
across states and practices. A pessimistic explanation for the lack of difference in adoption levels
between the DP and comparison areas would be
that the DP program is not working. However,
given the overwhelming significance of the 'Demo
Aware' variable in the adoption models, a more

plausible explanation is that the comparison area
is not completely isolated from the DP area. This
seems more likely given that some producers in
the comparison area have knowledge of the DP
program.

5. Concluding remarks

This paper has examined the adoption of management practices which improve water quality
and maintain or improve farm profitability. The
USDA Demonstration Project program is based
on the premise that information regarding the
benefits of the practices will provide sufficient
adoption incentives. Fostering adoption through
education is a reasonable, and possibly more
cost-effective, alternative to direct regulation or
financial incentives. To assess the DP program, a
theoretical adoption model which allows information to influence the adoption decision by decreasing uncertainties associated with each practice was specified. This model was estimated using the results of a producer survey containing
information about the adoption patterns for five
BMPs across different states, and across DP and
comparison areas.
The estimation results are cautiously in favor
of the DP program. Formal tests of the models

revealed that adoption patterns are significantly
different for two of the five practices, and
marginally different for a third. More importantly, the models demonstrated that knowledge
of the DP program has a significantly positive
influence on adoption rates. Because producer
assessments of each BMPs impact on farm profitability was important, this suggests that the success of information programs depends on improved practices being economically appealing as
well as environmentally sound. Only then will
voluntarily adoption occur.
Given the objectives of an informational incentive program, the results also suggest that producers in different regions respond differently to
information about the benefits of BMPs. Care
must be taken in designing an efficient incentive
program that accounts for these regional differences in water quality problems and crop production particulars. In implementing such a program,
the results in this paper show that the effect of a
DP site is not confined to small, localized areas
near the DP. If BMPs are economically attractive this information should spread through the
fa~ing community and increase adoption.
6. Appendix of qualitative results
If a BMP is adopted, its level of use is defined

from condition (4) in the text. The endogenous
parameter is X; the exogenous parameters are p,
a C. and w. The change in the endogenous
' "
parameters
with respect to the exogenous parameters is found through application of the implicit
function theorem to condition (4) (Silberberg,
1989). If g is any exogenous parameter, the form
of this expression is - Vx8 /Vxx' where the denominator (i.e., the second-order condition for
(4)) is negative and the numerator is defined for
each parameter as follows:

VLp=EU'(·) [

-w sO

Vxc;= 0

For (Al), the first term is positive given the utility
function (see footnote 1); the second term is
positive because U" < 0, and the term in brackets
is negative from (4): V' > 0, U' > 0, so p af( ·);ax
-w < 0 to satisfy (4). Identical reasoning applies
in determining the sign of (A2).
In the text, we explained the association between increases in the variance of 'Y; with increases in uncertainty surrounding adoption of
practice i. For simplicity we can parameterize an
increase in the variance of 'Y; as a mean-preserving spread:

Y; =

Y;

+ ( Y;- Y;)'TI

where y is the mean of 'Y; in (1). Note that
E[y;] = )i;, and var(f) = (y;- :YY77 2 • Inserting Y;
for 'Y; in condition (4) and dropping the i subscript for notational simplicity, it can be shown:

The first term is positive if y > y (see discussion of (Al)). If the cross partial, a2f(X; y)jaX
ay, is large and negative, the expression above is
therefore nonpositive; the producer practices the
BMP less intensively as the variance of y increases.
To investigate how decreasing absolute risk
aversion (DARA) affects the results of the comparative statics, consider the expressions for
ax;a'lT and ax;a77. As the producer's income
increases, his attitudes toward risk will determine
whether ax;a'lT and ax;a77 become more positive or negative. Because P is a component of 'IT,
we can further expect that any parameter change

P.M. Feather, G.S. Amacher/Agricultural Economics 11 (1994) 159-170

170

that makes 7T increase will have the same effect
as the price. We investigate these propositions
here.
The importance of risk aversion to the input
use 1 intensity decision is determined from the
expression - Vx7T!Vxx' where:
Vx7T=E'YU"(·) [Paf(X;y)jaX-w] ~0

Dividing the numerator and the denominator of
this expression by U'( ·) =fo 0, and using the Arrow-Pratt measure of risk aversion (Varian, 1984)
gives the following result:

where p(7T)= -U"(·)/U'(·) is the Arrow-Pratt
measure of absolute risk aversion, D =
[V'( · )/U'( · )], D' = V"(- )jU'( · ), and B =
P af(X; "y)jaX- w =::;;; 0 from condition (4) (see
discussion of (Al) and A2)) and strict concavity of
U( · ). For increases in profits, both D and D'
decrease in absolute value (assuming separable
utility). Therefore, under DARA, p'(7T) ::;;; 0, so
that aL ;a1r becomes more positive as profits
increase if the producer becomes less risk-averse
with increasing income.
Similarly, we can investigate how changes in
risk aversion effects the decision to accept practices with greater uncertainty (i.e., greater variances). Proceeding as above, but this time dividing ax;a71 through by U'( ·) =1= 0:

where the denominator N is equivalent to that of
ax;a1r. The condition above generally has an
indeterminant sign. Under DARA and for relatively small changes in 7], ax;a71 becomes more
positive (intensity of use increases) as farm income increases. For a practice that has a very
large variance in its effect on profits, the effect of
risk aversion on intensity is unclear.
