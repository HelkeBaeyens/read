Abstract
In recent years, there has been increasing emphasis in the rural development literature on the multiple income-generating
activities undertaken by rural households and the importance of assets in determining the capacity to undertake these activities.
Controlling for the endogeneity of activity choice and applying Lee's generalisation of Amemiya's two-step estimator to a
simultaneous equation model, household returns to assets from multiple activities are explored for the Mexico ejido sector. To
incorporate the multiple variables representing social and public capital into the analysis, factor analysis is used. The results
indicate that the asset position of the household has a significant effect on household participation in income-generating
activities and returns to those activities. Furthermore, the inclusion of measures of social and public capital into the analysis
show that these assets play an important role in income-generating activities and that the influence is dependent on the type
of social and public capital as well as the particular activity.

the role of the institutional context in determining the
use of and returns to assets. For example, Ellis (2000)
defines a livelihood as comprising "the assets (natural, physical, human, financial and social capital), the
activities and the access to these (mediated by institutions and social relations) that together determine the
living gained by an individual or household". Livelihood diversification is then the process by which
households construct a diverse portfolio of activities
and assets to survive and improve their standard of
living (Ellis, 2000).
The livelihoods approach has played an important
role in highlighting the multiple activities undertaken

by rural households, the importance of assets in determining the capacity to undertake activities, the dynamic nature of the actions of rural households and the
link between the diversification of assets and activities
(Barrett and Reardon, 2000). Evidence from developing countries indicates that rural households rely on
a number of assets and employ multiple activities to
generate income. In particular, there has been strong
evidence indicating the increasing importance of rural
non-farm activities. Reardon et al. (2001), for example, show that, based on a set of studies from Latin
America, rural non-farm activities make up 40% of
rural household income. Furthermore, the trend is toward greater non-farm activities for rural inhabitants.
While the livelihoods approach has contributed to
our understanding of rural household behaviour, there
has been little empirical examination of the approach.
A number of recent studies have recognised the role
of a diverse set of assets in income-generating activities. For example, Lanjouw (1999, 2001) examines
non-farm income in Ecuador and El Salvador using
assets such as human capital (education, literacy), natural capital (land) and public capital (electrification,
water connection) as explanatory variables. Winters
et al. (2001) explore the role of assets, including social
and public capital, in the decision to migrate. Corral
and Reardon (2001), and De Janvry and Sadoulet
(2001) explore the importance of natural, human,
social and public capital in the generation of income
in Nicaragua and Mexico, respectively. While recognising the importance of assets in income-generating
activities, these studies do not consider both the simultaneous nature of asset allocation and the selectivity
bias created by the decision to participate in an activity.
One recent study that does consider these issues is
by Taylor and Yunez-Naude (2000). Their paper focuses on the returns to schooling from a diverse set of
activities in rural Mexico broadening consideration to
both household head and family schooling. Taylor and
Yunez-Naude's paper is interesting from an econometric point of view in that they carefully address issues
affecting bias and inefficiency in parameter estimates.
By controlling for endogeneity of activity choice and
using Lee's generalisation of Amemiya's two-step estimator in a simultaneous-equation model, the resulting estimators are asymptotically more efficient than
other two-stage estimators, such as the commonly used
Heckman procedure.

In this study, we use the same econometric approach as Taylor and Yunez-Naude to explore livelihood strategies in the Mexican ejido sector. Unlike
Taylor and Yunez-Naude, our main interest lies in
exploring the importance of community level factors,
particularly social and public capital variables, in the
participation in and returns to income-generating activities. Empirical evidence suggests that along with
other forms of capital, social and public capital play
an important role in household income-generation.
For example, an analysis of Tanzanian households
shows that higher levels of social capital are associated with greater levels of expenditure (Narayan and
Pritchett, 1999). Understanding the role of social and
public capital in income generation has important
policy implications for governments. If governments
decide to invest resources into alleviating poverty,
it is essential to know how social and public capital influence income generation. Incorporating social
capital and community level variables representing
public capital into the analysis of assets and activities
has proved problematic since these assets are generally difficult to measure in a way that truly represents
the specific attributes of these assets and reflects how
households secure benefits from them. We address
this issue by using factor analysis to identify specific
factors to represent social and public capital.
The remainder of this paper is divided into four sections. Section 2 provides a conceptual background for
the relationship between assets, activities and income
and discusses the empirical strategy for examining the
use of assets in income-generating activities. Section
3 uses the Mexico data to define the set of assets rural
Mexican household use for generating income. Participation in activities and returns to assets are examined
using the Taylor and Yunez-Naude (2000) empirical
approach. In Section 4, the issue of measuring and including social and public capital is addressed. Measures of these assets, calculated using factor analysis,
are then included in the activity equations. Finally, in
Section 5 conclusions are discussed.

2. Rural livelihood strategies: conceptual
framework and empirical approach
The basis of a livelihood strategy is the asset position of the household at a given point in time. Note

P Winters et al. I Agricultural Economics 27 (2002) 139-156

that, as has become standard practice, household assets
are defined broadly to include natural, physical, human, financial, public, household and social capital. 1
These assets are stocks, which may depreciate over
time or may be expanded through investment. Based
on access to a particular set of assets for a given period, the household must decide which activities it
will employ and the intensity of involvement in that
activity. For purposes of this paper, activities are actions taken by the household to produce income. They
involve the use of a single asset or a set of assets.
Agricultural production, for example, may use natural
capital in the form of land and water, human capital,
physical capital such as tractors, financial capital for
the purchase of inputs and social capital in the form
of labour assistance by community members. Alternatively, non-farm wage employment may only use human capital. The intensity of an activity depends on
the degree to which assets are used. A strategy of agricultural intensification is likely to involve a greater
use of human capital and financial capital (for the purchase of inputs) than a strategy that focuses on other
activities or in less intensive agricultural production.
The decision on the set of activities a household will
employ and the intensity of those activities is conditioned on the context in which the household operates.
The context influences household decisions through
natural forces, markets, state activity and societal institutions.
Conceptually, the mapping of assets to income
through activities can be viewed as similar to a production process, with assets corresponding to factors
of production and income as the output of the process
(Barrett and Reardon, 2000). The return to assets depends on the parameters of the functions, which are
determined by prices of inputs and outputs as well
as other characteristics of the context. The allocation
of assets to each activity is expected to maximise
household income subject to a number of constraints.
Households will allocate assets in a manner that
equates the marginal value product across activities
1 The types of capital that households access can be categorised
in a variety of manners. One common categorisation is to define
four types of capital: natural, human-made (physical), human and
social (Serageldin and Steer, !994). Our categorisation reflects a
desire to provide greater detail in the types of capital used by
households although each of these categories can be subsumed in
one of the four categories commonly presented.

or will allocate assets entirely to one activity that has
a superior return.
One of the key features of this approach is that
households simultaneously determine the allocation of
assets to different activities. Failure to consider the
simultaneous nature of the decision can lead to curious and often contradictory results across different
studies. For example, Taylor and Yunez-Naude (2000)
note that research on the returns to schooling in rural
economies range from high to negative. They argue
that the reason for this is that researchers have failed to
take into account the technological changes and sectoral diversification that characterise agricultural transformation in developing countries. Households may
reap the rewards from schooling through abandoning
or limiting one activity in favour of another. A low or
negative return to schooling in crop production, for example, may mean that the more educated have shifted
to other activities such as non-farm employment. Similarly, this logic holds for all assets. If the government puts a paved road through to a community, this
may cause some households in that community to alter income-generating activities. Researchers focusing
on a single activity may find that investment in infrastructure reduces income from that activity, which
may lead to perverse policy implications. While this
may be the case, analysis of a single activity ignores
the benefits of infrastructure in other activities. Only
through considering all income-generating activities
simultaneously can this problem be avoided. The issue we want to examine in this paper is the relative
importance of different assets in the activities chosen
by rural Mexican households, with particular emphasis on social and public assets.
The household's decision on the allocation of assets
across activities is a simultaneous decision and one
that is censored by the fact that households do not
necessarily participate in all possible activities. Some
households will therefore have zero income from, for
example, self-employment. 2 Examining the allocation
and returns to assets requires a simultaneous equation
model in which the dependent income variables are
censored by unobservable latent variables influencing
2 Table I notes the participation rates for each activity. Less than
half of households participate in non-agricultural wage employment, agricultural wage employment, self-employment and migration.

the activity participation decision. Households obtain
income from an activity only if they participate in that
activity. Participation in an income-generating activity
occurs if the household believes the expected returns
to that activity are greater than the alternative of not
participating.
The econometric approach follows Lee's generalisation of an estimation principle of Amemiya
(1977a,b) in a general simultaneous equation model.

Lee (1978) compared Amemiya's generalised twostage estimators with other two-stage estimators,
and showed that Amemiya's estimators are more
efficient in all cases, including those proposed by
Heckman. This econometric specification allows for
censored dependent variables, where unobservable
latent variables influence the decision to participate in
an activity. Recently, Taylor and Yunez-Naude (2000)
utilised Lee's generalisation in their study of returns
to schooling in both crop and non-crop activities in
rural Mexico and we follow their empirical approach.
In the first step, probits using the complete set of asset
variables as explanatory variables are estimated. The
probit on each income-generating activity measures
the effects of assets on household participation in that
activity. The probits are also used to calculate inverse
Mill's ratios (IMR), which are included in the second
step to control for selectivity bias. The second step is
to estimate the income equations, including an IMR
as a right-hand side variable in each of the corresponding income equations. The income equations are
estimated jointly, to reflect the simultaneous nature
of the decision, for the full household sample using
three stage least squares which allows the inclusion
of information contained in the cross-equation error
correlations. For the income equations, only assets
that are expected to affect the income level of that
activity are included as right-hand side variables.
The data used in this study comes from a nationally
representative sample of Mexican ejido, or land reform, households. 3 Data were collected at two points
in time during the Spring and early summer of 1994
and 1997, for 972 households. 4 The survey covered
a wide array of household assets as well as household
3 The ejido is the land reform mechanism utilised by the Mexican
government from the 1930s to 1992. Land and water resources
were granted to a community or a group of producers, or ejido,
with each producer obtaining usufruct rights over a parcel and
access to common lands. A 1992 constitutional reform ended the
distribution of land and established a process by which individual
titles may be provided to ejidatarios, and by which ejidos may
decide to privatise individual parcels. The ejido sector covers
75% of all agricultural producers in Mexico (roughly 3 million
households), and over half of the country's irrigated and rainfed
land.
4 The Secretariat of Agrarian Reform and the World Bank carried out the surveys with assistance from the University of California, Berkeley. A detailed description of the Mexico data and
its sampling properties can be found in Cord et a!. (1998).

demographics, income-generating activities and participation in organisations. Community-level data was
also collected on characteristics and organisation of
the ejido. Most of the data used in this analysis, including the income data, is from the 1997 survey except in some cases where 1994 data was used to avoid
endogeneity problems.

3. Assets and income-generating activities
Household activities can be divided into six
categories: crop production, livestock production,
self-employment, non-agricultural wage employment, agricultural wage employment and migration.
Table I presents data on these activities. On average households earned 10,888 pesos in 1997. Not
all households participate in every activity. A majority of households participate in crop (93.7%) and
livestock (75.3%) production but few participate in
self-employment (17.2%) and migration (15.8%).
Agricultural activities (crops, livestock and agricultural employment) make up 55% of total rural household income showing that nearly half of income is
generated by non-agricultural activities. Crop income
represents about 30% of total income in 1997 and
is the most important source of income followed by
non-agricultural wage income (27 .1% ). However, only
42.3% of households participate in non-agricultural
wage employment and for those that do, it is the most
important income-generating activity (52.8% of total income). Similarly, households that participate in
self-employment and migration receive, on average,
one-third of their income from this activity. A number of agricultural households have thus shifted away
from agricultural to non-agricultural activities.
Asset ownership varies significantly across the
ejido sector. In Table 2, explanatory assets are grouped
into the following categories-natural (land), physical (livestock, equipment), human (education, gender,
labour, labour experience and ethnicity), financial
(credit), and migration (US and Mexico migration networks) capital. Regional variables are also included
to control for unobserved factors. On average, households have substantially less irrigated land than either
rainfed or pasture land. For the 25% of households
with irrigated land, average size is 5.2 ha. Although
overall households hold an average of 6.4 heads of

with livestock own on average 13.5 heads. Education
level is divided by gender as we hypothesise that the
returns to human capital vary by this differentiation.
As would be expected, the average number of male
and female household members decreases with increasing levels of education. Labour composition and
experience vary significantly across households.

that activity are not particularly interesting. Rainfed
land and livestock ownership positively influence participation in livestock production while irrigated land
and tractor ownership are negatively associated with
livestock participation. This is not surprising since
these latter assets are likely to have higher returns for
crop production. For a similar reason, tractor owners
are less likely to participate in self-employment. Natural and physical capital reduces participation in both
forms of wage employment. The positive association
between rainfed land and remittance income may indicate that participation in migration requires at least
a minimal wealth level. Education, particularly among
males, plays a strong role in non-agricultural wage employment. Minimal male education, or literacy, seems
to play a similar role in livestock production. Higher
levels of male education are negatively associated
with receipt of remittances. Younger households (as
indicated by age of household head) are more likely
to participate in agricultural wage employment, and
older households in receiving remittances. The presence of young males, controlling for education, leads
to increased participation in agricultural wage labour,
while the presence of older males leads to greater
participation in crop production. Previous experience in non-agricultural activities (self-employment
and non-agricultural wage earning), not surprisingly,
leads to a greater probability of participation in each
respective activity. However, previous experience in
agricultural wage employment leads to greater participation in crop production, agricultural wage earning
and migration. Somewhat surprisingly, access to formal credit in 1994 does not influence participation
in any activities in 1997. This could be because
credit is primarily tied to crop production. Indigenous
households are more likely to participate in on-farm
activities and less likely to migrate. A number of
regional variables are associated with particular activities suggesting there are certain regional factors that
influence participation that are not controlled for in
the regression. Finally, migration networks are most
important for receiving remittance income.
Table 4 presents the results of the selectivity corrected system estimates of the income equations.
While the probits evaluated the probability of participation in activities, the income equations examine
the factors influencing the level of income from
each activity. Note that in all estimates, except for

self-employment, the IMR is significant at the 95%
level or above. This indicates that self-selection into
activities is an important factor in considering the
income-generated from a particular activity and failure to control for this would have led to biased results.
Assets play a variety of roles in terms of the generation of income by activity. Land size, particularly
irrigated land, is important for on-farm categories as
well as self-employment and remittances. Rainfed
land is important for livestock income, as it serves
as an input into livestock production. Rainfed land is
also important for self-employment suggesting that
farmers with more land are able to earn more through
self-employment than others. Education provides the
most interesting story. Education is most important,
not surprisingly, for non-agricultural wage labour,
though this varies by gender. All levels of male education lead to higher off-farm income, while only the
highest level of female education has a positive-and
significant-coefficient. On the other hand, the number of females aged 15-34 years, holding education
constant, has a positive and significant effect, signalling that lower levels of female education are not
valued on the labour market. This is presumably due
to the kind of entry level employment rural women
can choose from, such as domestic servant. Female
education is also important for self-employment income, and surprisingly, livestock income. Both higher
levels of male and female education are associated
with higher agricultural income, suggesting that education only becomes important when it reaches a
certain technical level.

4. Adding social and public capital
The purpose of this section is to discuss a method
for the inclusion of community variables, including social and public capital, in the analysis of
income-generating activities and to present the results
of the analysis. There has been some debate over
the precise definition and measure of social capital
(Woolcock and Narayan, 2000). Social capital can
be defined as a variety of different entities with two
common elements: they all consist of some aspect of
social structure and they facilitate actions of actors
within that structure (Coleman, 1988). For our purposes, social capital constitutes the social relations,
both vertical and horizontal, that help facilitate the

P. Winters et al./ Agricultural Economics 27 (2002) 139-156

generation of income. Since our interest is in examining the community factors that facilitate income generation, we focus on relations at that level. Households
may belong to a set of formal and informal organisations that may provide direct or indirect assistance
in economic activities. For example, membership in a
women's group may provide information on market
opportunities for non-farm products. In addition to
membership in individual organisations, the ejidos in
which households live may be well or poorly organised which will also affect the households' ability to
generate income. Finally, vertical ties to, for example,
organisations that provide technical assistance will
influence income-generation. Each of these is considered as part of social capital. Another asset that
is difficult to measure and plays an important role in
income generation is public capital, which involves
access to public goods and services. These include a
range of services and infrastructure from health care
and telephone access to electricity and paved roads.
Calculating the value of social and public capital
is complicated by the diversity and multiplicity of indicators. Households belong to a range of organisations both formal and informal and ejidos may have
different types of organisational structure. Infrastructure and services differ in terms of their presence and
importance in a community. Table 5 lists a variety of
community variables that may be used as public and
social capital indicators. They range from measures of
ejido organisation and household participation in organisations to the distance to various public services,

the level of community infrastructure and direct household access to publicly provided infrastructure.
The challenge for analysing the benefits of social
and public capital in income-generating activities is
determining a method for using the information contained in this large set of variables. Two options have
generally been used. The first is to create a single
numerical index that is a weighted average of the
relevant set of variables. A higher value for the index
implies, for example, greater social capital. The index
is then used in subsequent analysis such as regression
analysis of income generation. Narayan and Pritchett
(1999) use this approach to examine household income generation in rural Tanzania. The problem with
this approach is that it requires strong and somewhat
arbitrary assumptions about the weights for each
variable in the aggregation. Furthermore, this method
assumes that a single numerical index is sufficient to
represent social or public capital. However, as with
other forms of capital, social and public capital are
not homogenous entities. The World Bank (2000), for
example, identifies three types of social capital: bonding, bridging and linking. A single index ignores this
possibility. Even if multiple indexes were to be created to measure the various types of social or public
capital, defining the different indexes would still be
arbitrary.
The second approach to including social and public
capital variables in income analysis is to use all or
a subset of the variables directly in income regressions. For example, De Janvry and Sadoulet (2001)
in evaluating the determinants of income in the ejido
sector include social and institutional assets (indigenous household and access to technical assistance)
and locational characteristics (number of urban centres within 1 h, number of rural centres within an
hour and regional dummies). One problem with this
approach is in deciding which variables adequately
represent the presence of social and public capital.
Which variable in Table 5, for example, represents
the level of infrastructure in a community? The problem with including all or even a significant number
of variables in regression analysis is that this specification can lead to problems with degrees of freedom,
if the sample is not sufficiently large, and multicolinearity if, as is likely, the multiple social and public
capital variables are highly correlated. In the presence
of multicolinearity, identification is not a problem

but with highly correlated variables estimates are less
precise (Greene, 1997).
Given the shortcomings of these two methods in
this paper, a third method, factor analysis, is used to
incorporate social and public capital into the analysis
of income generation. The primary purpose of factor
analysis is to describe the relationships among many
variables in terms of a few underlying, but unobservable, factors (Johnson and Wichern, 1988). Factor
analysis groups sets of variables by their correlations
and each group of variables represents a single underlying construct or factor. 5 For example, Kline
and Wichelns (1996) use factor analysis to evaluate
respondents' perceptions of farmland preservation
programs. Based on reasons provided for preserving
farmland, they identify four factors that seem to explain preferences: environmental objectives, aesthetic
objectives, agrarian objectives and anti-growth objectives. Similarly, using the multiple measures of social
and public capital, the underlying factors that represent the important characteristics of these assets can
be determined. In one such study, Onyx and Bullen
(2000), using a set of 36 measures of social capital
from five Australian communities, identify eight factors that represent social capital including community
participation, agency and trust. While factor analysis
does assist in identifying underlying factors represented by a set of variables, the method is subjective
and requires interpretation of the factors to give them
meaning. This interpretation relies on previous knowledge and intuition about underlying relationships.
For this study, factor analysis was used to identify
factors that represent the important elements of social
and public capital. Social and public capital are not
necessarily homogeneous and more than one factor
was expected to emerge for each set of variables. Social and public capital variables were analysed using
the principal component factor method and rotated
using the varimax rotation method. 6 Typically, factors
5 Factor analysis is similar to principal components analysis
in that both are attempts to approximate the covariance matrix.
However, factor analysis is more elaborate and the primary question
it seeks to ask is whether the data are consistent with some
underlying structure (Johnson and Wichern, 1988).
6 As recommended as a first step by Johnson and Wichern
(1988). Additional methods including the iterated principal factor
method and the maximum likelihood factor method were examined. Since these approaches tended to bring about similar solutions the original principal components factor method was used.

P. Winters et al.lAgricultural Economics 27 (2002) 139-156

are retained in the analysis if their eigenvalues are
greater than one. To limit the number of factors retained the cut-off value was increased to 1.25, which
allows for a more straightforward interpretation of
factors. Even with this limitation, as will be seen
below, interpreting some of the factors is difficult.
At that cut-off, eight factors were retained which
represented 44% of the variance. 7 Results of the factor analysis are presented in Table 6. As is standard
practice, only factor loadings greater than 0.25 are
retained for interpretation. 8

4.1. Factor 1: proximity
This factor indicates the proximity of the community to infrastructure, services and urban areas. This is
evidenced by the high negative loadings on distance to
a health clinic ( -0.45), post office ( -0.84), telegraph
( -0.80) and a fax ( -0.88), and the time ( -0.76) and
distance to an urban centre ( -0.84). Households with
a positive association with this factor tend to be less remote than those negatively associated with this factor.

4.2. Factor 2: ejido population size
This factor is associated with ejidos that have a substantial population, which is accompanied by access to
substantial community services and infrastructure. The
positive associations with DICONSA and LICONSA
stores, 9 as well as with the presence of a meeting
room, a secondary school and a high school show this.
The negative associations with distance to a health centre and to a post office also indicate a large community
with access to those services. The negative association
with PROCEDE reforms and the positive association
with environmental degradation are indicators of the
co-operation problems associated with having a large
7 This corresponds to the 49% of the variance explained by the
eight factors identified by Onyx and Bullen (2000).
8 While only one set of results is presented, a number of methods
of factor analysis were explored. Although the order of the factors
differed across method, the results were largely consistent across
methods. That is, the loadings and relevance of certain variables
tended to be the same across methods suggesting these factors do
represent some underlying structure in the data.

12 years of age, and tortillas to extremely poor families, urban
and rural.

ejido-difficulty in organising the reform process and
difficulty in managing the resource base.

4.3. Factor 3: semi-urban
This factor appears to represent ejidos that are
semi-urban. The number of urban centres within an
hour has a large coefficient (0.62) as does the number
of rural centres within an hour (0.35). Hence, it is not
surprising to see a positive association with share of
roads that are paved, DICONSA store, meeting room,
secondary school and telephone access. An ejido near
an urban or rural centre is more likely to have greater
infrastructure and services. There is also a positive
association with the PROCEDE reform. Since this
reform leads to the allocation of individual property
rights, it is likely to be the case that the reform process will occur in areas where land can be more easily
sold or rented, as is generally the case in semi-urban
areas. Finally, there is a positive relationship with
informal organisation participation. Again this could
be associated with a semi-urban setting where populations tend to be denser and organising for cultural
and economic reasons is easier.

4.4. Factor 4: co-operation
This factor clearly represents co-operation within
the ejido as evidenced by the strong loading on households frequently participating in assemblies (0.72), respecting community agreements (0.71) and belonging
to informal organisations (0.40).

4.5. Factor 5: lack of formal production
arrangements
This factor describes the lack of formal production
organisation in the ejido, as there is a strong negative association with an ejido belonging to an ARIC 10
( -0.63). Furthermore, a substantial number of households associated with this factor do not participate in
'other' formal organisations ( -0.54), production contracts ( -0.48) and the government technology transfer program ( -0.48). There is a somewhat peculiar

goals.

positive association with household agreement on the
use of common lands.

4.6. Factor 6: household access to infrastructure
This factor represents the degree to which households have access to services as indicated by the strong
loadings on water (0.46), sewage (0.75), bathrooms
(0.72) and telephone (0.48) access. Households positively associated with this factor also tend to have a
lower share of the population speaking an indigenous
language and lower environmental problems. This partially reflects that indigenous households tend to live
in more marginalised communities.

4. 7. Factor 7: infrastructure
This factor shows the degree of access to infrastructure. This is evident through the strong loadings on
public lighting (0. 71), electricity (0.66), share of paved
roads (0.48) and water access (0.35). The results indicate that ejidos that have formal organisational structures tend to have this type of infrastructure and those
with informal organisations are less likely to have the
corresponding infrastructure.

4.8. Factor 8: formal ejido organisation
This factor represents an ejido that has a formal
organisational structure, indicated by the factor loadings on ejido membership in a campesino organisation
(0.59) and ejido union (0.33) as well as the participation in production contracts (0.36). The high loading
on communal lands per capita (0.32) may indicate a
community with a need for formal structures. Access
to emergency work and paved roads may also be an
indicator of the community's ability to organise and
lobby government officials for assistance.
The results suggest that social and public capital
are not homogenous and a number of factors represent
their role in income generation. This calls into question the use of single indicators of social or public
capital. Using these factor loadings and the regression
method suggested by Thomson (1951), 11 a new set of
variables representing each of the eight factors can be

generated. As is standard practice, the factors are normalised to have a mean value of 0 and standard deviation 1. Using these measures of social and public capital, the two-step econometric procedure outlined in
Section 2 and presented in Tables 3 and 4 was repeated.
Table 7 presents the new results of the pro bits for activity participation. The majority of the results remain
the same as the preliminary estimations, suggesting
their robustness. Results that differ with respect to statistical significance from Table 3 are set in italics.
Participation in activities appears to be influenced
by a number of social and public capital factors. Proximity to an urban centre is found to be negatively associated with agricultural wage employment as well
as remittance income. This most likely reflects the fact
that isolated households have few off-farm options
other than agricultural wage employment or migration.
Households in ejidos with large populations appear to
be less likely to participate in livestock production,
reflecting problems in managing the resource base.
Not surprisingly, households in a semi-urban setting
are more likely to participate in self-employment and
non-agricultural wage employment, as the opportunities for households living in these settings are much
higher. Receipt of remittance income is less likely in
a semi-urban setting and is also negatively associated
with infrastructure and formal organisation again suggesting that dependence on external transfers may be
the only alternative in the face oflimited opportunities.
Household access to infrastructure is positively associated with self-employment, as many microenterprises
require minimal infrastructure access. Finally, formal
organisation in the ejido is positively associated with
participation in crop production, livestock production
and non-agricultural wage employment. The ejido organisational structure clearly influences the choice of
income-generating activities.
Table 8 presents the results of the selectivity corrected system estimates of the income equations
including the social and public factors. As with the
probits, the majority of the results remain the same as
in Table 4. One notable exception relates to male education levels. The results from Table 8 suggest that
higher levels of male education are negatively associated with livestock income. Taken together the results
suggest that households with significant male education concentrate on non-agricultural wage employment
and crop income (for those with tertiary education).

Moving to the examination of the social and public
capital variables, a number of these variables significantly influence the level of income generated from
each activity. Proximity to an urban centre positively
influences the level of crop income while semi-urban
status is negatively associated with crop income. This
suggests a non-linear relationship in the benefits of
urban access. Households that are very near urban
and rural centres are likely to earn less crop income
than households further out on the periphery of these
centres. However, households that are very far away
earn significantly less income. The results also indicate that households with access to basic infrastructure such as water, sewage, bathrooms and telephones
earn higher income from crop production. A similar
result is found for livestock income, self-employment
and non-agricultural wage employment. These results
show that a community with substantial household access to these types of infrastructure is likely to have
greater income-generating opportunities.
Lack of formal production arrangements appears
to limit crop, livestock and self-employment income
(meaning that the presence of formal production
arrangements would improve income from these
sources). These formal production arrangements seem
to play an important role in increasing the level of income received by households. However, formal ejido
organisation is negatively associated with livestock
income. These results provide evidence for the view
that the types of social and public capital matter. Both
of these variables are indicators of social capital as
they measure associational activity. However, only
an association with productive oriented organisations
has a positive influence on livestock income. Both
non-agricultural and agricultural wage income are
positively related to the level of infrastructure. Ejidos
with access to electricity, public lighting, water and
paved roads, all general indicators of economic development, provide higher wage employment income
than those without.

5. Conclusion
Our analysis of households in the Mexico ejido sector shows that a household's asset position has a significant effect on its participation in specific activities
as well as on the level of income earned from those

activities. Households choose a portfolio of activities
and the intensity of involvement in those activities
based on their asset position. These results support the
livelihoods approach to household behaviour, which
argues the importance of assets in determining the
capacity of households to undertake certain activities.
Furthermore, the results show that partial analysis of
income generation-that is, the analysis of a single
income-generating activity-can potentially lead to
incorrect conclusions about the role of a particular
asset in income generation. For example, our results
indicate that high levels of male education result in
greater participation and returns to non-agricultural
wage employment but lower income from livestock
production. While these results mirror the general
conclusion of Taylor and Yunez-Naude (2000) that
returns to schooling vary across activity, we find
that education participation and returns differ across
gender and that the return to education is primarily
through non-agricultural wage employment and crop
production. While the returns for crop income for men
and women at the highest level of education are similar, lower levels of female education are not valued on
the labour market. This is due primarily to the type of
employment to which young rural women are limited:
domestic help.
Our analysis also shows the critical role that social
and public capital play in household participation in
activities and the level of income generated by each
activity. By using factor analysis, the forty community
variables are reduced to four public capital factorsproximity, semi-urban status, household access to
infrastructure and general infrastructure; three social
capital factors-co-operation, lack of formal production arrangements and formal ejido organisation; and
one factor-ejido size-that shows the effect of ejido
population on both public and social capital. These
factors represent the key underlying community characteristics that are likely to influence household behaviour. Their heterogeneity suggests that each will
influence that behaviour in a unique manner, and
inclusion of these factors in the regression analysis
shows this factor-specific influence. Creation of a
single index of social or public capital would have ignored the importance of this heterogeneity, and using
a subset of social and public capital variables would
have led to ambiguity regarding the reason for the
effect since each indicator might represent multiple

P. Winters et al. I Agricultural Economics 27 (2002) 139-156

components of social and public capital. Factor analysis provides an alternative to these methods and
identifies the particular manner in which social and
public capital influence income generation. Failure
to adequately incorporate social and public capital
variables can lead to inaccurate or ambiguous results.
The results from the regression analysis indicate
that ejido organisation is important in determining participation in crop and livestock production,
non-agricultural wage employment and remittance income. The location of the household relative to urban
areas (proximity and semi-urban status) is also important in influencing participation in self-employment,
non-agricultural and agricultural wage employment
and remittance income. In terms of income levels,
lack of formal production arrangements hinders agricultural and livestock income generation, as well as
self-employment. The type of infrastructure accessible by the household affects income, with household
access to infrastructure associated with greater levels
of all kinds of income, with the exception of agricultural wage and remittance, and general infrastructure
access associated with higher levels of both types of
wage labour. Finally, while being very close to urban
or rural centres limits crop production income, intermediate proximity to urban centres improves crop
production income.
The findings presented in this paper have a number of implications for Mexican government policy
towards the ejido sector. First, although all ejiditarios
have access to land, many are no longer dependent
on agricultural production for most of their income
and are using the assets at their disposal for a number
of income-generating activities. Policies designed to
improve agricultural production will not necessarily
have the desired or expected effect since households
may respond by shifting assets to other activities.
Government interventions should recognise the potential fungibility of assets and incorporate this into
the design of the intervention. In this regard, Mexican
government interventions consisting of cash transfers
to agricultural producers in the ejido sector, through
the PROCAMPO program, give beneficiary households some flexibility in the use of the monetary transfers and have been shown to be effective in alleviating
poverty (Sadoulet et al., 2001). Second, social and
public capital variables have an important influence on
income generation. In designing policies to improve

155

the income-generating capacity of ejiditarios, such as
policies to alleviate poverty, the government needs
to recognise the role of these factors. In particular,
interventions need to recognise and respect the social
fabric of the community and include activities to enhance the role of formal and informal organisations.
For example, based on the results presented in this paper, if the Mexican government wished to embark on
a strategy of improving non-agricultural employment
opportunities for ejiditarios, it should begin by understanding the role ejido relationships play and take
actions to improve ejido organisation (this might also
induce participation in crop and livestock production).
Additionally, it should improve household access to
both household level and general infrastructure since
each of these enhances the level of income earned
from non-agricultural employment. Similarly, if the
government decided to commit resources to generally
improving income levels, investing in household access to infrastructure is likely to have the broadest and
greatest impact. Ignoring the role of social and public
capital in the ejido sector would constitute a missed
opportunity and could prove costly if interventions
side-step the social structure of the community.
