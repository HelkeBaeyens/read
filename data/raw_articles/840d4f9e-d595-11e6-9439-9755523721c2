Abstract
The conventional gravity model is revised for a single commodity and applied to meat markets to determine
factors affecting trade flows of meat. This study demonstrates that the gravity model for a single agricultural
commodity can be parameterized more effectively by using time series and cross-section data rather than cross-section data alone. This study reveals that trade policies and subsidies used by exporting and importing countries,
livestock production capacity in countries, and distances play an important role in determining trade flows of meat.
Long-term agreements achieve the highest performance toward enhancing international meat trade. Import quotas
and the hoof-and-mouth disease on beef greatly impair meat trade.

1. Introduction

The world meat market is a good example of
market intervention. Exporting countries compete with one another to increase and/ or maintain their market shares. Most exporting countries use Long-term trade agreements with the
importing countries and direct subsidies to domestic producers to promote exports. Most importing countries use various types of trade restrictions, ranging from qualitative restrictions
(e.g., a complete ban of meat imports due to
health care concerns related to hoof-and-mouth
disease) to quantitative restrictions by imposing
quotas to protect domestic producers. In some
importing countries, direct subsidies to con-

sumers are used to promote domestic production
and to reduce foreign imports.
Trade flows of commodities are generally determined on the basis of the principle of comparative advantage in a free trade market system.
Since trade flows of meat are distorted by government interventions, determinants of the trade
flows and their economic effects are not clearly
known. The objectives of this study, therefore,
are to identify and evaluate factors affecting volume and direction of meat trade flows. Special
attention is given to analyze specific effects of
export promotion programs and import restriction policies on the world meat trade.
Most research work in this area used spatial
equilibrium models based on mathematical programming algorithms (Takayama and Judge, 1964;
Bawden, 1966; Mackinnon, 1976; Koo, 1984). In
these studies, trade flows are explained by the
prices of commodities in importing and exporting
countries and transportation costs between coun-

tries. However, Thompson (1981) indicated that
spatial equilibrium models performed poorly in
explaining trade flows of commodities that are
generally distorted by exporting countries' export
promotion programs and importing countries'
protection policies. A commodity-specific gravity
model, therefore, is used to evaluate bilateral
trade flows of meat and account for the policy
factors unique to the pairs of trade partners.
Gravity models have been used to describe
bilateral trade flows between country pairs. Formal theoretical foundations of the models were
provided in Anderson (1979) and Bergstrand
(1985, 1989). Typical gravity models contain the
following variable components: (1) economic factors affecting trade flows in the origin countries,
(2) economic factors affecting trade flows in the
destination countries, and (3) natural or artificial
factors enhancing or restricting trade flows. Natural or artificial factors would include trade policies. In this study, the typical gravity model for
aggregate goods is respecified to analyze trade
flows of meat.
Traditional models commonly use cross-section data relevant to a particular year. Our study
departs from the tradition by using pooled time
series and cross-section data. The formulation
greatly improves the efficiency of the results and
permits the use of the information available over
several years for each pair of trading countries.
Further, we demonstrate how the Hausman specification test and the Breusch and Pagan test are
used to choose between competing models. The
study shows strong evidence that single commodity trade models should include trade policies.
The development of the commodity-specific
gravity model for the world meat trade is presented in the next section. Econometric issues
and specification tests are discussed in Section 2.
Then estimated models, using the econometric
techniques of Hsiao (1986), and the analysis of
our findings are presented in Section 3. The last
section includes concluding remarks.
2. Commodity-specific gravity model

The derivation of the single commodity gravity
model follows the procedure indicated in trade

literature. According to Linneman (1966) and
Bergstrand (1985, 1989), a gravity model is a
reduced form equation from a partial equilibrium
of demand and supply systems. The demand
equation for the specific commodity is derived
from maximizing the constant elasticity of the
substitution (CES) utility function subject to income constraint. The supply equation is derived
from the firm's profit maximization procedure in
exporting countries with resource inputs allocated
according to the constant elasticity of transformation (CET) during the production process.
The commodity-specific gravity model, under
market equilibrium conditions of demand and
supply systems, can be derived as follows:

( 1)
i=1,2, ... ,N and j=1,2, ... ,M
where X;j is the volume of commodity traded
from country i to country j; Y; Oj) represents
income of country i (j); cij is transport cost
(c.i.f.jf.o.b.) between countries i and j; Tij represents any other factors either aiding or resisting
trade between countries i and j; P; (lj) is the
price of the commodity at country i's export port
(country j's import port); Eij is the spot exchange
rate - the value of country j's currency in terms
of country i's currency; and e;j is the random
error term. Eq. (1) is derived theoretically in
Bergstrand (1985).
An exporting country's income can be interpreted as the country's production capacity, while
an importing country's income is the country's
purchasing power. It is expected that trade flows
are positively related to the exporting and importing countries' income. Transportation costs and
tariffs, which are trade barriers, should be negatively related to volume of trade flows. The prices
of a commodity in exporting and importing countries are important in determining trade flows. A
commodity moves from a country in which the
prices of the commodity are low to countries in
which the prices are high. Trade flows are hypothesized to be positively related to changes in
export prices and negatively related to changes in
import prices. Exchange rates are one of the most
important factors affecting trade flows. Appreciation of a country's currency against other curren-

W W Koo et al. 1Agricultural Economics 10 (1994) 81-88

cies reduces the country's exports and increases
imports, and depreciation stimulates the country's
exports.
Unlike traditional gravity models of aggregate
good trade in Bergstrand (1985, 1989), Anderson
(1979) and Linneman (1966), the commodityspecific gravity model can incorporate the unique
characteristics and policies associated with trade
flows of the specific commodity in exporting and
importing countries. In the model, an exporting
country's income is replaced with the country's
farm income (GoP for the farm sector) to represent the country's overall production capacity of
agricultural commodities. In addition, animal
numbers in exporting and importing countries are
included in the model to measure livestock production capacity. 1 The price variables are replaced with export and import unit value indices.
In meat trade, the t;j variable in Eq. (1) is replaced with export promotion and import restricting variables. Exporting countries use various export promotion programs, including Long-term
agreements between pairs of trading countries
and subsidies to producers. Meat from one country is differentiated in terms of quality from other
countries. Dummy variables representing specific
countries are included in the model.
On the import side, the hoof-and-mouth disease is a major factor resisting meat trade. Several countries maintain a complete ban on beef
imports from countries infected with hoof-andmouth disease. A dummy is introduced to account for meat trade flows from countries infected with the disease. 2 Quota is another
trade-resistant factor and a major protection instrument imposed by importing countries to protect their domestic industries.
The variables aiding trade are expected to be
positively related to trade flows while those resisting trade are hypothesized to be negatively related to the flows.
A dummy variable representing trade flows of
meat among EC member countries is also included in the model. It is hypothesized that European economic integration in EC enhanced meat
trade among members. The empirical model also
includes an adjacency dummy variable representing border countries under an assumption that

83

more trade occurs between countries with common border. The empirical gravity model for meat
trade is therefore specified as follows:
eO' 12L D ij eO' 1JO D ij e a 1411 D ij e 0' JSE D ij

i=1,2, ... ,N and

(2)

j=l,2, ... ,M

where A, (A) represents animal number in
country i (j); Dij is distance between countries i
and j; S; (S) represents producer (consumer)
subsidies in country i (j); ED;j is a dummy variable identifying trade flows among EC member
countries ( = 1.0 if both countries i and j belong
to EC, and zero otherwise); LDij is a dummy
variable representing Long-term agreements; OD;j
is a dummy variable identifying countries imposing import quotas; HD;j is a dummy variable used
to identify and separate origin countries infected
with hoof-and-mouth diseases from those free
from the disease; and U,j is the random error
term. Producer subsidy equivalent (S;) is defined
as an aggregate subsidy measure given to producers; similarly, consumer subsidy equivalent (S.)
is
1
defined as an aggregate subsidy measure given to
consumers.
Finally, some remarks are in order regarding
the appropriateness and use of qualitative variables to represent trade policies. Trade policies
were not in force for every year and country
during the period of the study. Some program
values were zero at times. Thus, policy variables
were coded into qualitative variables to limit those
variations. We recognize that qualitative variables
identify average effects, but they provided more
coherent results.

3. Econometric procedures and source of data

As indicated earlier, classical gravity models
used cross-section data to estimate trade relationships in a particular year. However, in the real
world, cross-section data observed over several
years may provide more useful information in
determining trade flows than cross-section data
alone. This is especially true for agricultural and
livestock commodities for which trade flows are

highly volatile due to weather conditions in importing and/ or exporting countries. The estimated parameters of the model with cross-section
data for a particular year may not provide accurate information in evaluating trade flows of a
commodity. Hence, in this study we propose to
parameterize the econometric model in Eq. (2)
with both cross-section and time series data.

sistent over time and cross-section units (the pairs
of trading countries). Financial data, such as gross
domestic products, and exchange rates were taken
from the International Monetary Fund's (IMF)
International Financial Statistics and world tables
published by the World Bank. Data on quantity
and dollar volume of meat exports and imports
were taken from the United Nations International Trade Statistic Yearbook. Animal numbers
were obtained from FAO Production Yearbook.
Export price data were computed by dividing the
total value of exports by the quantities exported.
Import prices were computed by dividing the
total value of import by the quantity imported.
Eq. (2) includes trade policies used by exporting and importing countries. The appropriateness
of policy variable augmentation should be subject
to specification tests. An F-test statistic developed by Godfrey (1986) shows that in modelling
specific commodity trade flows, trade policies affecting the commodity flows should be included
in the models. Data on export promotion programs and trade restriction policies were obtained from Hillman (1978), Longworth (1984),
Ojalla (1985), Patterson (1983), Simpson (1982)
and USDA (1988, 1989). Subsidies given to producers and consumers, expressed in terms of producer subsidy equivalent (PSE) and consumer
subsidy equivalent (CSE), were obtained from the
U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Ocean freight rates are not available for all
countries included in the analysis. An alternative
is to estimate an ocean freight rate function with
available sample rates for each year and to use
the function to estimate missing rates. This approach, however, did not provide particularly superior results aside from the task of dealing with
errors-in-variable modeling. We used distances as
a proxy 3 for transport cost. The distances were
calculated by using the oceanographic maps published by the U.S. Navy.

where xijt is trade observation from i to j at
time t (t = 1, 2 ... T); ZiJt is a corresponding
trade determinant vector; ~i is the trade effect
associated with the country pair i and j; and Ar is
the time effect specific to a particular year. Eq.
(3) has the main advantage of allowing for different individual and time effects for each country
pair. Following the theory for analyzing pooled
data, the null hypothesis that ~i = 0 and A1 = 0
was rejected by the Breusch and Pagan test statistic 4 reported in Table 2. Since the country pair
effects (~) and the time effects (Ar) are significantly different from zero, whether the effects
are fixed or random should be determined. The
Hausman specification test 5 (Table 2) suggests
that the fixed effect model commonly known as
the covariance model should be used in this analysis (Hausman, 1979, p. 1269). The White test for
heteroscedasticity (White, 1980) indicates that error terms do not have serious heteroscedasticity
within cross-section units.
Additional variables added to the empirical
model in Table 2 are dummy variables for adjacent countries and dummy variables for exporting
countries (Argentina, Australia, Austria, Brazil,
Canada, EC, Uruguay, the United States, and
Yugoslavia). 6
All models in Table 2 are estimated by using
Least Squares techniques on variables expressed
in deviation forms. As explained in Hsiao (1986,
p. 31), no dummy variables for individual country
pairs and/ or time effects are needed.
Model 1 is based on the assumption that only
the time effects (Ar) are equal to zero. Model 2 is
based on the assumption that only the cross-section effects (p.i) are zero. Model 3 is based on an
assumption that all trade effects vary over both
cross-section and time series units through the
intercept term. Model 3 is the most efficient since
the model does not include any constraints and
is, therefore, used in the analysis. Most estimated
parameters have the expected signs and are statistically significant.

4. Results

Eq. (2) in time series and cross-section form is
as follows:

(3)

Effects of income, price, and exchange rate. Animal numbers in exporting and importing countries are used to represent a measure of livestock
production capacity in these countries. In addition, gross domestic product for the farm sector is

86

W W Koo eta!. 1Agricultural Economics 10 (1994) 81-88

used for overall production capacity in the agricultural sector while disposable income is used to
represent consumers' purchasing power of the
importing country. The estimated coefficients on
exporters' farm income and livestock production
are positive as hypothesized but do not differ
significantly at the 5% level. This is mainly because most exporting countries have excess production capacity of red meat. The estimated coefficients on importers' income and livestock production are positive and negative, respectively, as
hypothesized and differ significantly from zero at
the 5% level. This indicates that direction of
meat trade flow is influenced largely by importers
income and livestock production.
The estimated import and export price elasticities are negative and positive, respectively, as
hypothesized. The corresponding t-values indicate that the coefficient on the export prices
differs significantly from zero at the 1% level and
import price does not. Furthermore, the magnitude of the elasticities are less than 1.0, in the
absolute value, implying that quantities of meat
traded are not sensitive to meat prices.
Exchange rates used in this analysis are defined as changes in the prices of importing countries' currencies in terms of exporting countries'
currencies. The coefficient for the exchange rate
variable is positive as hypothesized. An appreciation of an importing country's currency (a depreciation of an exporting country's currency) makes
the exporting country's meat cheaper in the importing country's market and increases trade
flows. However, the causal relation is not statistically significant at the 1% level.

Effects of trade promotion programs and restriction policies. The model includes trade promotion
and restricting policies. Specification tests indicate that export promotion programs and traderestricting policies should be included in the empirical model of meat trade. The export promotion program (LTA) has an expected positive
sign. The corresponding t-statistics indicate that
the variable is significantly related to the quantities of meat traded at the 1% level. Exporters'
subsidies to meat producers, however, do not
differ significantly from zero at the 5% level.

The hoof-and-mouth dummy variable is significantly related to meat trade. The presence of the
disease in some countries prevents trade with a
large portion of the world. The absence of the
disease is an important determinant to trade. The
estimated coefficient indicates that freedom from
hoof-and-mouth disease is an important enhancement to trade.
Some importing countries have used quotas to
restrict imports to support their domestic livestock production. The variable has a negative
sign, and its coefficient differs significantly from
zero at the 1% level. This implies that quotas
used by the importing countries reduce trade
volume of meat. The consumer subsidy equivalent is an aggregate measure of subsidies given to
consumers in importing countries. The variable
representing the consumer subsidy is negative as
hypothesized and differs significantly from zero
at the 1% level, implying that the positive subsidies to consumers lower trade flows of meat.

Effects of differentiated meat based on countries.
The model includes dummy variables representing major exporting countries that produce meat
differentiated in quality from one another. For
example, Australia produces low quality hamburger meat while the United States produces
high quality meat. Dummy variables identifying
specific countries of origin are significant at the
5% level. This supports the hypothesis that meat
products are differentiated by country of origin.
Effects of EC and transportation costs. Typical
gravity models include distance and dummy for
adjacency. A longer distance between a pair of
trading partners impairs trade. The estimated
coefficient on the dummy variable representing
the countries with a common border has a positive. sign and is statistically significant at the 1%
level. This implies that trade volume increases
among countries with a common border. The
distance variable is negative and significant at the
5% level. This is especially true for meat for
which transportation costs are higher than for
other agricultural products.
The European integration into a common market enhanced meat trade among the member

W W Koo eta/. I Agricultural Economics 10 (1994) 81-88

countries. This supports the theory of welfare
economics, which proves that economic integration increases welfare of the member countries
through increases in trade volume among the
countries. The coefficient for the EC dummy
variable is positive as expected and is highly correlated to the quantities of meat traded according
to the t-statistic. This implies that the EC significantly enhances meat trade among member countries.
5. Concluding remarks

A reduced form gravity model derived from a
partial equilibrium model of world trade is revised to evaluate trade flows of a single commodity and applied to the world meat market to
evaluate and analyze factors affecting meat trade
flows. The model for meat trade is estimated with
time series and cross section data. Special attention is given to evaluate impacts of meat export
promotion and import restriction policies on trade
flows.
This study shows that the modified gravity
model is applicable to single commodity trade
flows. In the case of meat, the model provides
statistical descriptions of meat flows and still retains the classical features of the conventional
gravity models.
On the export side, price of beef, livestock
production capacity, and differences in meat
quality among countries are major factors affecting trade flows of red meat. Exporting countries'
subsidies to producers represented by producer
subsidy equivalent do not influence trade flows.
The Long-term agreement significantly enhances
meat trade between the participating countries.
On the import side, importing countries' gross
domestic products, livestock production capacities, and trade-restricting policies such as quotas
and other border protection, significantly influence trade flows of meat. In general, importing
countries' policies influence trade volume and
direction more than exporting countries' policies.
Common border and economic union, such as
EC, stimulate trade flows, while distances between exporting and importing countries negatively influence trade flows. Hoof-and-mouth dis-

87

ease is another factor affecting trade flows of
meat negatively.

6. Endnotes

A country's production capacity of livestock is
related to the country's overall production capacity of agricultural commodities, mainly because
livestock production requires an abundant supply
of other agricultural commodities such as feed
grain, pasture, and soybean meal.
2 The hoof-and-mouth disease is applicable to
only beef trade. Since the model evaluates trade
flows of meat, including beef and pork, beef trade
from countries infected with the disease are separated from those that are free of the disease by
using a dummy variable.
3 Linneman (1966), Bergstrand (1985, 1989) and
Summary (1989) used distance as a proxy of
transportation costs.

meat quality among exporting countries under an
assumption that meat produced in one country is
different from that produced in other countries.
