ABSTRACT
Belete, A., Dillon, J.L. and Anderson, F.M., 1991. Development of agriculture in Ethiopia
since the 1975 land reform. Agric. Econ., 6: 159-175.
A stated objective of the Ethiopian Government since it came to power in 1975 has been
to increase the production of crops for both domestic consumption and export. Consequently, a number of plans and programs have been proposed and implemented to bring
about such development in Ethiopian agriculture. This paper mainly focuses 011 a macro
review of the general course of Ethiopian agricultural development since the land reform of
1975. The food production in Ethiopia has lagged behind the population growth as
evidenced by the gap between the growth rates of population (3%) and food production
(1.8%) over the period from 1970 to 1983. Recently, this situation has, perhaps, further
deteriorated. Seventy-one percent of the total land mass is estimated to be suitable for
agriculture, but only about 19% is cultivated. This suggests an underutilisation of land.
Moreover, Ethiopia has a persistent subsistence production problem in agriculture. Agricultural research and education which are essential to development have not been given due
attention by the policy makers. As a result, the agricultural technologies used by farmers
have changed little in this century. Moreover, small-scale farmers, although still the most
potent economic force in the country, have not been given the incentives necessary to
expand production, and currently receive less than adequate support from the central
government. Some 85%, 50%, and 79% of total agricultural credit, fertiliser and improved
seeds respectively go directly to socialist enterprises (state farms and producers' cooperatives) which, up to 1985, have jointly accounted for only 5% of the total cultivated land and
4% of the national crop production. The favouring of large-scale and capital-intensive
state-owned farming enterprises with credit, subsidies, and fiscal incentives, while neglecting
smallholders, has contributed to the stagnation of agricultural production in Ethiopia.
Overall, the analysis indicates that there has been no significant development of agriculture
in Ethiopia following the 1975 land reform.

INTRODUCTION

Ethiopia is primarily an agricultural country. It is believed to possess an
immense potential for agricultural production, a potential which has not
yet been realised. Out of the total land area of 1.22 million km 2 , some 71%
is estimated to be suitable for agriculture. However, only 19% of the land is
at some time used for crop production (NRDCjCPSC, 1983; MSFD, 1984).
This apparently low rate of utilization is due in part to endemic problems
of malaria, sleeping sickness, etc. in the lowland areas. But 40% of the
country's total area is classified as highlands (above 1500 m a.s.l.) and
about 88% of the national farming population lives in these highland areas.
Prior to 1975, the agrarian economy in Ethiopia was principally feudal.
During the feudal era an agricultural surplus was extracted by a relatively
small group of landlords. It is generally believed that the system kept the
peasantry impoverished and preserved outmoded primitive cultivation
practices. Insecurity of individual tenure under the feudal system also
reduced We incentives for tenants to increase yields through investment in
the improvement of land. The overall effect of these tenure arrangements
was reflected in the stagnation of agriculture. This perceived bottleneck
was removed by the land reform proclamation of 4 March 1975 which made
all rural lands public property and thereby fundamentally altered agrarian
relationships in Ethiopia (PMAC, 1975). Since 1975, through a series of
related proclamations, the government has sought to organize agriculture
into production units of individual farms, each of at most 10 ha, state farms
(mainly comprising former estates, plantations and large commercial farms)
and producers' cooperatives.
Under the land reform, private farm households were .organized into
Peasant Associations (PAs) each encompassing a nominal 800 ha and
typically made up of 300 to 400 farmers and their households. Members of
each PA cultivated the land as individuals. The total number of PAs, as of
1985, was 20 158 with a total membership of some 5.6 million households
(MOA, 1985b). In the same year there were 54 state farms operating on
250 000 ha of land. There were also 1856 producers' cooperatives, of which
only 191 were registered and had legal status. These cooperatives accounted for a total of 132 842 farm households (MOA, 1985a).
In spite of these major changes to the structure of agriculture in the
country, production has stagnated.
Currently, Ethiopia is experiencing a wide food gap. Agricultural production has been increasing annually by about 1.8% while population
growth is approximately 3% (World Bank, 1984). Although recent data are
not available, per-caput consumption of cereals and pulses fell steadily
from an estimated 415 g per caput per day in 1975/76 to 367 gin 1981/82

(FAO, 1982). Ethiopia has become a regular importer of some 300 to 400
thousand metric tonnes of food grain each year. Imports of food increased
from US$11.2 million in 1974 to US$62.3 million in 1982 (NBE, 1982). The
total volume of food aid flowing into the country increased from 135 000
metric tonnes in 1978 to 243 000 metric tonnes in 1982 (FAO, 1982). The
increase in food aid is even more striking if the drought years of 1984 and
1985 are taken into account. In each of these years, international food
assistance reached 1.1 million metric tonnes of grain (RRC, 1985).
The basic constraint on development in Ethiopia is that agriculture
presently produces little economic surplus. Yet, it is the agricultural sector
that can provide investable resources for national development. Agriculture, according to NRDCjCPSC (1982a), should finance its own growth
and also finance industrialisation of the country. The problem, therefore, is
how to achieve development and growth in agriculture. An appreciation of
the general course of agricultural development in Ethiopia since the 1975
land reform may provide some insights on this matter to decision makers in
Ethiopia.
ROLE OF AGRICULTURE IN ETHIOPIA'S ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
STRATEGY

Agriculture can directly contribute to Ethiopia's economic development
in six important ways. These are (NRDCjCPSC, 1983):
(1) by providing basic food supplies for the nation;
(2) by generating foreign exchange earnings through agricultural exports;
(3) by supplying labour needed by the industrial sector;
(4) by providing the necessary capital for industrial development and social
investment;
(5) by raising the income of the rural population and thereby being an
important source of effective demand; and
(6) by providing employment for a significant part of the rural population.
The size and sectoral origins of Ethiopia's GDP over the period 1970/71,
to 1985/86 are shown in Table 1. From these data it can be seen that
agriculture's share of GDP, at around 50% (made up of some 80% from
crop and some 20% from livestock production) did not change significantly
over the period. The industrial, domestic trade and other services sectors
account for about 15%, 15% and 20% of GDP, respectively. The data also
show that agriculture made an almost equal contribution to the GDP of the
country during both the pre- and post-1975 period. The development of the
non-agricultural sectors has not significantly reduced the overwhelming
domination of the economy by the agricultural sector. The economic
development of Ethiopia will continue to depend primarily on agriculture
for many decades to come.

Agriculture's contribution is also notable in the earnings of foreign
exchange needed for modernization of the country. Over the ten-year
period 1975/76 to 1984 j85, export earnings largely originated in agriculture. Table 2 shows that agriculture's share in the total value of exports was
close to 90% over the period 1975j76 to 1984/85. The value of coffee
exports has generally increased. However, the value of exports of pulses
and oil seeds has tended to decline. Exports of livestock and their products
and other industrial crops have not grown importantly.
PERFORMANCE OF THE PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SECTORS OF AGRICULTURE
SINCE 1975

Appropriate production technologies, research, extension and agrometeorological services are important factors affecting agricultural productivity in Ethiopia.
Regarding production technology, the evidence available from Shibru

University (AAU, 1980), confirms the view that improved and appropriate
technology is not available or used by significant numbers of smallholder
farmers in Ethiopia.
, The large gap between crop yields on research plots and on farmers'
fields indicates that the research results are either beyond the small
farmers' reach or they are not extended to the farmers in a proper way
(Table 3). The complex geography of Ethiopia and important local differences in climate, soils, etc., make it most difficult to overcome these gaps
unless the funding of agricultural research is dramatically increased.
The shortage of agro-meteorological services and information in the
country, for example, suggests that the problems associated with climatic
variation in a country like Ethiopia where smallholder agriculture depends
entirely on rainfall, are overlooked. The country also has substantial
environmental constraints to increased production among which the most
important are erosion due to inadequate water and soil conservation
programmes, high human and livestock population pressures on agricultural land, and repeated and persistent drought especially in the northern
and northeastern areas. These constraints limit directly the opportunities
of development efforts, especially in the peasant farming sector where
individual farmers' efforts can not mitigate their effects.
The relative importance, in productivity terms, of the three types of
agricultural production units - individual farms, state farms and producers'

96% of the national agricultural output. For the same period, state farms
accounted for 3.2% of the total cultivated area and contributed about 2.8%
of the national crop. The PCs accounted for roughly 1.8% of land in
agricultural use and contributed about 1.2% of the total national crop
production.
Over the same period, cereals dominated national crop production,
accounting for over 80% of the area sown (Tables 5 and 6). Pulses and
oilseeds accounted for all but a minor percentage of the remainder of the
croppmg.
Estimates of the annual compound growth rate of area and of production for the period 1975 j76 to 1985 j86 indicate that the output of cereals
increased by an average of 1.91% per annum, whereas the annual growth
rate in area sown was 0.88%, the output of pulses and oilseeds increased by
1.67% and 6.74% per annum, respectively, while their growth rate in area
was 1.26% and 3.36% per annum, respectively. The compound growth
rates in area and production were highest for oilseeds due to the establishment of state farms and the formation of producers' cooperatives since
these two sectors have given special emphasis to the production of exportable crops such as oilseeds.
Table 7 shows that, at the national level, yields per hectare of most
major crops have been declining. The national level yield data were
disaggregated to assess the annual change in yields per ha at the sector
level. The results are presented in Table 8. They indicate that positive

State farms do not produce these crops.

Tables 7 and 8 indicate that the relatively insignificant growth in cereal and
pulse production in Ethiopia over the post-revolutionary decade was not
only due to no expansion of the cultivated area but also to declines in yield,
particularly in the state-owned and operated agricultural sectors. More
importantly, the annual growth rates of cereal and pulse production -both
estimated to be less than 2% - are less than the current annual population
growth rate of 3%. For reasons of national food security and development,
it is vital to determine why total crop production has not significantly
increased over the period of the last 11 years when, supposedly, the
problem of tenure insecurity was solved by land reform and improved
technologies had been extended to farmers.
Some discussion of livestock production is necessary to give a more
complete picture of Ethiopian agriculture. Livestock play an important role
in Ethiopian farming in supplying animal power for cultivation, especially
in highland areas. In the highlands, peasant farmers keep livestock as a
form of insurance against crop failure, as a form of savings for emergency
use, for breeding draught animals for cropping, to supply transport services, to supply manure for fuel and as a source of meat and milk (FAO,
1982; GOE/ AACM, 1984). The national herds and flocks are mainly kept

in the highlands where disease challenges to livestock are less than in the
hotter lowland areas. Livestock are privately owned and the markets for
stock, meat and other animal products are not subject to significant
government intervention. Livestock have been and still are the single most
important capital asset of rural people. The Ethiopian highlands are
stocked at an average of 35 Tropical Livestock Units per km 2 - higher than
any other area of comparable size in the continent. Ethiopia has the largest
livestock population in Africa (FAO jLUPRD, 1984). The estimated livestock population of Ethiopia in 1982 is shown in Table 9. Its size is
impressive, but its productivity is low (Table 10). There are several reasons
for this (FAO jLUPRD, 1984).
Firstly, the number of livestock in Ethiopia is not in balance with the
available feed resources. Overstocking - associated with consequent land
degradation - is widespread in the highland areas. General levels of
nutrition of livestock are low and constrain both production and reproduction. Secondly, although the highlands are largely free of trypanosomiasis
and other important diseases mainly occurring in the lowlands, livestock in
the highlands are affected by many other diseases causing morbidity and

mortality. Thirdly, the livestock marketing system is poorly developed. The
main livestock production and surplus areas are located far from the main
local meat-consuming andjor exporting centres. The transport of animals
over these long distances is largely by trekking. Animals are driven for days
without proper feed, water and rest causing significant bodyweight losses
prior to slaughter. In the traditional husbandry systems, draught oxen are
given priority in feeding over stock which are traded or sold, so the latter
are seldom specially fattened prior to disposal. Nevertheless, livestock sales
are the major source of cash income in the largely subsistence farming
areas. Introduced livestock breeds have had little impact nationally and
they are mainly in the small-scale commercial dairy sector proximate to
Addis Ababa (Tegene and Tenassie, 1984).
INVESTMENT IN AGRICULTURE

The central importance of agriculture to the nation is stressed in the
national development plan of Ethiopia (NRDCjCPSC, 1983). The plan has
acknowledged the need to increase and diversify agricultural output, to
achieve self-sufficiency in food supply, and to raise rural incomes and living
standards. To achieve this, substantial public investment in agriculture is of
paramount importance. Viewed over time, perhaps the most notable aspect
of public investment in agriculture is that its post-1975 share is greater than
its pre-1975 share (Table 11). The socialist Government formulated its first
ten-year long-term plan in 1981 for the period 1984 to 1994 (NRDCjCPSC,

1982a). According to this plan agriculture will receive 22.1% of the total
national investment. Out of the total agricultural budget, 10.8% is for
peasant farming, 6.1% for state farms, 22.4% for producers' cooperatives
and settlement farms, 38.6% for irrigation farming on state farms, 9.8% for
export crops, 4.2% for forestry, 7.8% for livestock and 0.3% for fisheries.
The most striking point, however, is the large absolute and relative size
of investment envisaged for the irrigation and settlement sub-sectors.
These two sub-sectors together constitute 61% of the total investment
planned for agriculture and over 13% of total planned investment. Settlement farms are also state-owned farms. Irrigation farming is exclusively on
state farms. By contrast, peasant farming is to receive only 11% of the total
investment planned for agriculture corresponding to 2% of the planned
total national investment. This underscores the lack of appreciation of the
strategic role of smallholders in the development of Ethiopian agriculture.
Furthermore, the apportioning of this investment between the peasant and
cooperative peasant farming is not clear. It is likely that despite their poor
performance to date (mid term through the ten-year plan), the emphasis
will continue to be on state farms, producers' cooperatives and settlement
farms. This will result in underinvestment in the peasant sector, the sector
which has, despite limited state support since 1975, provided the only
productivity gains observed in Ethiopia's agricultural economy.
A number of projects have been implemented during the last 20 years to
supply farm inputs (e.g., fertilizer and improved seed), to provide short-term
credit for the purchase of inputs and to make agricultural extension
services available to smallholders. Nonetheless, the domestic allocation of
capital outlays for these 'package' programs was generally inadequate and

most of them were dependent on external funds for their operation.
Agriculture, besides providing food and employment to the people and raw
materials to industries, also supplies about 90% of the total exports by
value. Despite this, the allocation of foreign exchange for the purchase of
agricultural equipment and imported farm inputs was only between 2.3%
and 10.2% of total export proceeds from agriculture over the period
1971/72 to 1980/81 (NRDCjCPSC, 1982b). Also, although the agricultural sector contributes more than 50% of GDP and accounts for 85% of
employment, the resources allocated to agricultural research are inadequate. In 1982/83, for instance, only about 0.4% of the 1981/82 GDP was
allocated to agricultural research.
INCENTIVES TO PRODUCERS

Farmers growing crops for sale have responded to the failure of the
government to provide them with proper incentives (prices) by retreating
further into the subsistence mode. Virtually all government farm-gate
prices (obligatory quota selling prices) for the private sector for most crops
have lagged well behind local free-market prices. Farmers terms of trade
deteriorated as producer prices remained fixed relative to the prices of
major agricultural inputs, particularly of fertilizer. At current official prices
smallholders do not cover their cost of production for some crops.
The pattern of distribution of fertilizer, improved seed and agricultural
credit has also disadvantaged smallholder farmers. As may be seen from
Tables 12, 13 and 14, state farms (which for example in 1980/81 contributed less than 5% to national crop production and constituted less than

5% of the total area cultivated) used 52% of the fertilizer, 79% of
improved seed and 91% of agricultural credit available nationally. In the
same year, the peasant sector which cultivated 95% of the area and
contributed 94% of the national harvest used 43, 16 and 9% of fertilizer,
improved seed and credit respectively which were available.
Excessive emphasis on the two state agricultural sectors and hence
neglect of the peasant sector has resulted in low farm input consumption
by this latter sector. Smallholders' incentive for producing more are also
dampened by the large scale intervention of the State in food grain
marketing. This intervention compounds the difficulties of marketing in a
nation with limited road, transport and storage facilities.
CONCLUSIONS

Ethiopian agricultural development has been severely constrained by the
application of inappropriate agricultural policies and the dearth of investment in the smallholder sector which dominates the national economy.
Low productivity and poorly structured markets for agricultural inputs and
outputs have also contributed to the poor performance of the agricultural
sector since 1974/75. The often desperate food situation in the country has
not improved significantly since then. Poor growth in production can be
attributed to various factors, the most important of which are: the favouring of large-scale and capital-intensive state-owned farming enterprises
with scarce credit, other modern inputs and skilled labour to the relative
neglect and generally to the detriment of smallholders and the quantitative
and qualitative deficiencies of research, extension and other support service efforts.
The 1975 land reform did ensure access to land to the country's 5.6
million smallholder farm families. However, a successful land reform would
have taken better account of the economic, technological and social factors
involved.
The socialist agricultural revolution in Ethiopia has not yet resulted in
the cooperatives and state farms using more than 5% of the total cultivated
land or producing more than 4% of the total agricultural production
although, together, they have accounted for more than 60% of publicly
funded agricultural investment, 91% of agricultural credit, 79% of improved seed allocation and 52% of fertilizer used in the 1975 j76 to
1985 j86 period.
Objective conditions must be taken into account when moving from
redistribution to collectivization in a country where subsistence production
accompanied by a low level of technology continues to dominate the
agricultural sector. The drive towards collectivization should neither under-

estimate nor ignore the important economic role that could and should be
played by the small-scale farmers who presently account for 96% of total
agricultural production. Greater attention to the strengthening of smallscale farmers is warranted, indeed essential, in order to increase agricultural production and to promote rural development in Ethiopia.
