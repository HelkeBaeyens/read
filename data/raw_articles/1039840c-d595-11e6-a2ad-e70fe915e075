Abstract
This paper attempts to identify sources of resource use inefficiency for cotton production in Pakistan's Punjab. The use
of a non-parametric method, Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), is developed to study the relative technical and allocative
efficiencies of individual farms which use similar inputs, produce the same product and operate under comparable circumstances. In the 'cotton-wheat' system of Pakistan, there are a considerable number of farms that are both technically and
allocatively inefficient. The use of DEA shows that the technique provides a clear identification of both the extent and the
sources of technical and allocative inefficiencies in cotton production. However, both the interpretation of the farm level
results generated and the projection of these results to a higher level require care, given the technical nature of the agricultural
production processes.© 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction

Several recent studies on the technical and economic efficiencies of crop production in Pakistan,
particularly for wheat and rice, have pointed out the
existence of a 'yield gap'. This 'gap' refers to the
difference in productivity on 'best practice' and on
other farms operating with comparable resource endowments under similar circumstances (Akhtar et
al., 1986; Ali and Flinn, 1987; Hussain et al., 1991;
Khan et al., 1994). Surprisingly, these studies have
ignored cotton, despite it being the major export from
Pakistan.
The existing studies on technical and economic efficiencies have used the traditional parametric meth* Corresponding author. Tel.: +44-118-931-8480;

ods to estimate 'average' efficiencies only (Khan and
Maki, 1979; Ali and Flinn, 1987; Ali and Chaudhry,
1990; Ali et al., 1993; Battese et al., 1993; Parikh and
Shah, 1994; Parikh et al., 1995). The estimation of
such 'average' efficiencies appears to ignore the argument that the study of the individual farm is more important to measure the resource use efficiency, and that
the parametric methodology provides insufficient information for policy analysis (Kalirajan, 1984; Kalirajan and Shand, 1986). The research reported here supports the importance of studying the individual farm
efficiency, and it is the first study of its kind to have
used the non-parametric method of Data Envelopment
Analysis (DEA) for analysing the efficiency of individual farms in Pakistan.
The paper begins with a brief introduction of efficiency measurement and of the development of DEA.
The description of data sources precedes the explanation of the DEA model in general and the specification

of this model for cotton production. Next, the use of a
Cobb-Douglas type of production function for identifying the important inputs in the production process is
discussed before presenting the results of the technical and allocative efficiency analyses. Finally, the usefulness of the DEA model for examining the resource
use inefficiency of cotton production in Pakistan is
assessed.

2. Measurement of efficiency
The efficiency of production units is measured either by parametric or by non-parametric methods. The
first approach estimates the parameters of the production or cost functions statistically. The second one,
in contrast, builds a linear piece-wise function from
empirical observations of inputs and outputs, without assuming any a priori functional relationship between the inputs and the outputs. The non-parametric
or 'frontier' method of measuring efficiency was first
introduced by Farrell (1957) and since then several
improvements and extensions have taken place (see
Battese (1992) and Coelli (1995)).
Building on Farrell's work, Charnes et al. (1978)
have developed the fractional linear programming
method of DEA, which compares inefficient firms
with the 'best practice' ones within the same group.
It has been used widely for efficiency studies for
both public and private organizations (see Seiford and
Thrall (1990)). In the agricultural economics literature, however, only a few examples of the application
of DEA could be found (Haag et al., 1992; Shimizu,
1992; Cloutier and Rowely, 1993).

2.1. DEA
The DEA technique has come to be named after
its originators and is referred to as the CCR model.
It involves optimizing a scoring function defined as
the ratio of weighted sum of outputs of a particular
production unit and the weighted sum of its inputs,
that is efficiency. This function is optimized subject
to the condition that with any of the production units
included in the analysis, the value of the objective
function achieved cannot be more than I, implying
that the efficient units will have a score of 1.

The DEA method is regarded as one ofthe most successful techniques of analysis proposed by researchers
in Management Science and Operations Research, as
is evident by the profligacy of its applications (see
Coelli (1995)). However, the original version of the
CCR model is not very convenient for a linear programme as it has more restraints than variables, making it difficult to solve. Hence, the 'dual' version of the
CCR model is more popular as the DEA model. The
technical details can be found in Charnes et al. (1978),
Norman and Stoker (1991), Charnes et al. (1995), and
Coelli et al. (1998).

3. The sample of cotton producers
The data were collected from a randomly drawn
sample consisting of 120 farms from the cotton-wheat
area of the southern part of Pakistan's Punjab. The
sample farms can be treated as a homogenous group
for several reasons. First, all of the farms are in an
area where technical and agronomic practice recommendation domains are the same. Second, they are in
reasonable proximity to each other. Third, all of them
face uniform natural and market conditions and the
same infrastructure. Finally, all the farms have broadly
similar types of soils.

3.1. Characteristics of farmers and farms
Information such as the farm operator's age, his
educational attainment, the size of the farm family and
the number of family members involved in farming is
given in Table 1. Most of the farmers are over 25 years
old, with the age ranging from 20 to 60 years. The
family size is large and three-fourths of the farms had
more than nine members per household, and on nearly
half of the farms, at least two of the family members
were working as full time farm workers on farm.
Most of the farmers till their own land, but quite a
few rent additional area to increase the operational size
of their holdings. The holdings are divided into three
categories: farms which are less than 5 ha, 5-10 ha and
greater than 10ha. All the sample farms have similar
types of soils that are ideal for growing cotton. Cotton
occupies 77-85% of the area on different farms and
this proportion is even higher on large farms. Small
farmers in the area keep milch animals requiring land

4. The DEA model for cotton production

where}= 1, ... , 117 is the number of farms or Decision
Making Units (DMUs) in the sample, m=1 represents
cotton in the cotton-wheat system, i= 1, ... , 6 is the
number of inputs included in the analysis, Z0 is the
relative efficiency score of the DMU, 'o', under study,
A. j are lambda values that are the weights to be used
as multipliers for the input levels of a referent farm to
indicate the input levels that an inefficient farm should
aim at to achieve efficiency, Xij is the level of use for
the ith input on the jth farm, Ymj is the level of the mth
output on the jth farm, Yo is the level of the output on
unit 'o', and X0 is the vector of the levels of inputs
being used by the DMU 'o'.
The minimum value of Z0 (:::;1) for the unit 'o' is
found by 'combining' the performance of all units being analyzed. This is done in such a way that, for each
input, the combination of inputs does not exceed the
inputs of unit 'o' and for each output and the combination of outputs is at least as great as that of unit 'o'.
On solving the model separately for each DMU in the
sample, the efficiency scores ( < 1 for the inefficient
units and 1 for the efficient ones) are established. A
score less than 1 means that a linear combination of
other units from the sample could produce the same
vector of outputs using lower levels of inputs. The
problem of returns to scale can be dealt with by using
the Banker et al. (1984) extension to the CCR model
as: (a) for constant returns to scale (CRS), the condition I; Ai 2: 1 is added; and (b) for variable returns
to scale (VRS), the restraint I; Ai = 1 is imposed.
To obtain the efficiency scores, a linear programming matrix was constructed which included input
and output data for each of the farms in the sample.
It was then used to evaluate the efficiency of an individual farm by substituting its inputs and outputs
into the vectors Y0 and X0 in Eqs. (2) and (3) above.

M. Shafiq, T. Rehman/Agricultural Economics 22 (2000) 321-330

324

This 'iteration' or substitution was repeated 117 times
(three outlier farms were dropped from further analysis) to obtain efficiency scores for all the sample farms.
For a firm to be efficient, two conditions must hold:
(a) that the calculated value of Z0 that is Z" must equal
1; and (b) all the slack variables in the LP solution
must be 0 (Charnes et al., 1978).

5. Role of various inputs in crop productivity
It is quite usual to integrate some form of functional
analysis with the DEA model, mostly regression models, to identify those inputs that play a prominent role
in determining productivity. Subsequently, the relative efficiency of a production unit can be measured
(Charnes et al., 1978; Bowlin et al., 1985; Dyson
et al., 1990; Roll and Cook, 1993; Thanassoulis, 1993).
Thus, a Cobb-Douglas type of production function
was fitted to the data collected from the survey and
the results are discussed below.

5.1. Explanation of the variables
The major inputs that are assumed to determine
the cotton crop output (kg/ha) include irrigation water (number per hectare), nitrogen (kg nutrients/ha),
phosphate (kg nutrients/ha), labour (h/ha), pesticide
costs (Rs. per hectare) and tractor hours required per
hectare for levelling, ploughing, planking and planting. The basic statistics related to these variables are
presented in Table 2. It is clear that there is a wide variation in both the input use and the cotton output. The

output obtained by some of the farmers in the sample
was three times as high as that achieved by others;
and there were wide variations in the levels at which
inputs were being used. There were large differences
in the use of nitrogenous fertilizer as some farmers
were using six times more fertilizer as compared to
others and some farmers did not use any phosphatic
fertilizer. In preparing their fields for cotton planting,
some farmers use as few ploughings as two, whilst
some plough the fields 13 times before planting. Such
a variation in the levels of inputs being used suggests
that possibly these levels represent a mismanagement
of resource use.

6. Results of the statistically estimated function
In Table 3, a very low value of the adjusted R 2
(0.044) shows that the production function does not
explain a great deal of the relationship between the dependent and the independent variables as most of the
variables had a non-significant effect on the increase
in cotton output. Variables like phosphatic fertilizer
use, labour and tractor hours used show negative
returns, implying an excessive use of these inputs.
Thus, the levels at which these inputs are being used
could be lowered without reduction in output levels.
These results in effect confirm the need for undertaking the analysis of the efficiency of production using
a non-parametric method like DEA, as identifying
inefficient farms would imply discovering the extent
by which their input use could be improved. Furthermore, when there is as much variation in inputs used

and the output produced as shown in Table 2, the
efficiency analysis of individual farms assumes much
greater relevance.

The use of the basic DEA model started with the
single input-single output situation. More inputs were
introduced into the analysis, one at a time, to evaluate
the relative efficiency of individual farms. This procedure also shows how the increase in the number of
inputs affects the efficiency rating of individual farms.
As the basis for comparison among them is broadened,
the ranking of individual producers improves. In the
initial run, the single input is nitrogen. The second run
involved two inputs, nitrogen and pesticide expenditure; and for the third run, multiple inputs as defined
for the cotton production function were used. In all the
runs, seed cotton is the output. The efficiency scores
of the individual farms were calculated separately for
both CRS and VRS assumptions.
The basic DEA model for the 'DMU-1' assuming
CRS is stated below:

In the above equations, the subscript '120' refers to

The nature of a DEA model is illustrated in Fig. I
for a single input-single output situation. Each point
represents a farm included in the efficiency analysis.
The line OA is the efficient frontier assuming CRS,
as for each farm on that frontier, there is no other
farm with a better input/output conversion ratio and
there is only one farm (54) on the efficient frontier. All
other farms are inefficient, as they use greater amounts

of fertilizer to achieve their current levels of output
when compared to farm 54. Given a high variation in
nitrogen use, the pertinent question is, do higher levels
of nitrogen application contribute to an increase in the
crop yield? The results show that this is not the case,
suggesting that an excessive use of nitrogen on these
farms takes them below the efficient frontier.
The points depicted in Fig. 1 are scattered, and
therefore, the CRS assumption would seem not to apply. Assuming that VRS do exist and as this assumption is not so demanding, more farms are likely to be
located on the efficient frontier. There are four farms
(DMUs 2, 54, 28 and 33) with efficiency scores of
1 lying on the frontier, and they form the envelope
DCBE representing the frontier to be used as referent
for other farms. The use of nitrogen on the efficient
farms shows that the output increases with increase in
the level of input use.
The inefficient farms in the sample were using inputs at levels greater than required relative to the out-

put levels being obtained by other farms in the sample. A summary of the efficiency scores for all farms
is presented in Table 4. It is interesting to note that,
when VRS are assumed, only one farm has an efficiency score of less than 60%. Whereas, when CRS

are assumed, 38% of the farms have efficiency scores
of less than 60%.
7.1. Use of DEA results to study inefficiency on an
individual farm

By using the results of the DEA model, it is possible to work out what is required by inefficient farms
to become efficient. Take the farm DMU-70, with efficiency scores of 57.97 and 58.78 under the CRS
and VRS assumptions, respectively. For this farm, the
farms 40 (0.287), 54 (0.309) and 86 (0.382) are its referent units when CRS are assumed, while the DMUs
6 (0.043), 40 (0.246), 54 (0.316) and 86 (0.395) are
the referents when VRS are assumed.
The production practices of the DMU-70 and its referents are compared in Table 5, and clearly, the use of
inputs by the DMU-70 is 'excessive'. The 'excessive'
nature of the input use by DMU-70 is borne out when
the recommendations by the Central Cotton Research
Institute (CCRI, 1994) are considered. According to
CCRI in this area, nitrogen plays the dominant role in
determining cotton yield and phosphorus contributes
little, and to obtain optimal yield, there is no need to
plough the land more than four or five times. As is
obvious, this farm is not following the recommended
practices. However, this particular farm has a greater
number of land parcels (three) as compared to its
peers (DMUs 6, 46, 54, and 86) which are contiguous

327

farm holdings. This situation may have jeopardized
the chances of this farm becoming efficient.
The above comparison would suggest strategies for
the DMU-70 to rationalize the use of its inputs. The
lambda values obtained from the DEA solution for this
farm provide a composite DMU which would produce
the equivalent level of output, but by using lesser levels of inputs as shown in Table 5. This information as
generated by the DEA modelling approach is intrinsically interesting and the DEA model can be run to
examine allocative or economic efficiency of resource
use on individual farms, as illustrated in Section 8.

8. Results of allocative efficiency analysis
The interpretation of allocative efficiency depends
on the assumptions made about a farmer's behaviour.
Farrell (1957) assumed that cost minimization is the
basis on which a farmer's allocation decision is taken
to obtain a given level of output and the allocative inefficiency is a farmer's inability to equate the ratio of
marginal products of inputs to the ratio of their respective prices. Lau and Yotopoulos (1971), Schmidt
and Lovell (1979), and Kopp and Diewert (1982) have
assumed profit maximizing behaviour and have defined allocative inefficiency as the failure to equate the
marginal value product of inputs to their prices. In the
DEA model, however, the behavioural assumption is

Results of the estimation of both technical and
allocative efficiency show that technically efficient
farms were also allocatively efficient. However, some
units such as the DMU-101 and the DMU-111 were
technically efficient but were not so allocatively.

8.1. Sensitivity analysis for an individual DMU's
allocative efficiency

more subtle as the allocative efficiency is the proportion by which the costs of the levels of inputs on a
farm can be reduced without any loss in output. Thus,
an efficiency score of 0.8 implies that the DMU concerned could reduce its costs by 20% by choosing a
more cost-efficient input mix.
In measuring allocative efficiency of cotton production, the costs of individual inputs used have been estimated by using the actual prices paid by farmers. The
variables belonging to the same category were pooled
together to reduce the number of cost variables in order to facilitate analysis. The variables defined were
expenditure (in Rs. per hectare) on (i) land cultivation; (ii) cotton seed; (iii) thinning; (iv) inter-cultural
operations; (v) fertilizer; (vi) irrigation; and (vii) pesticide usage. The results as given in Table 6 show that,
assuming VRS, nearly 30% of the DMUs have an efficiency score of 1.

The DMU-83 has the lowest allocative efficiency
score of 56.67 (assuming VRS) and it can be used to
illustrate the use of sensitivity analysis for exploring
the avenues for improving the allocative efficiency.
The lambda values associated with the solution for
this farm show that the DMUs 30, 47, 54, 64, 84, 86
and 113 were its referent units (see Table 7). For most
of the inputs, the referent DMUs were spending considerably less than the DMU-83 particularly on pest
control, fertilizer, and cultivation. Using lambda values of the referent DMUs, the targets which DMU-83
can aim at become allocatively efficient and are presented in the last column of Table 7. This farm needs
to decrease its expenditure on pesticide, irrigation and
land preparation operations.

9. Concluding remarks
The preceding analysis points towards the existence
of a significant extent of resource use inefficiency on
cotton farms in the cotton-wheat production system
of Pakistan's Punjab. In many instances, the quanti-

• Lower cost of irrigation on these farms shows that canal water was the only source of irrigation at a fixed charge of Rs. 86 pel
hectare for the season.

ties of inputs used were unjustifiably higher than what
would be required to achieve their present levels of
crop output. By using the DEA modelling approach
for efficiency analysis, it is possible to achieve two
types of results. First, it is possible to identify the adjustments that can be made in the use of inputs on
inefficient farms by comparing them with their 'peer'
farms. Second, the factors that can be manipulated to
minimize the excessive use of inputs and hence reduce
the costs of production can be established. However,
for a meaningful interpretation of the DEA results, it
is necessary to consider the totality of recommendation domains for various production practices in specific areas, as without the inclusion of all the relevant
and important factors in the analysis, one cannot be
assertive about the sources of inefficiencies. Nonetheless, the DEA approach has an undoubted edge over
the standard production function analysis for identifying the sources of inefficiencies on individual farms.
The DEA results are much easier to interpret and to
utilize for investigating avenues for improvements in
technology and resource use efficiency on farms.
This exercise in using the DEA modelling approach
for measuring efficiency has demonstrated that there
was a high degree of allocative inefficiency, as regards
costs of production, on cotton-producing farms in Pakistan. However, the efficiency scores for both technical
and allocative efficiencies increase with increase in the
number of input variables included in the DEA model.
The real advantage of DEA modelling is that it allows
the specification of a multi-product, multi-input firm
(Byrnes et al., 1987). The construction of the 'efficient
frontier' for measuring the efficiency is achieved without having to make any pre-supposition regarding the
underlying functional form and the statistical errors
associated with the specification of such a function are
also avoided.
