Abstract
Increasing competition for water across sectors increases the importance of the river basin as the appropriate unit of
analysis to address the challenges facing water resources management; and modeling at this scale can provide essential
information for policymakers in their resource allocation decisions. This paper introduces an integrated economic-hydrologic
modeling framework that account~ for the interactions between water allocation, farmer input choice, agricultural productivity,
non-agricultural water demand, and resource degradation in order to estimate the social and economic gains from improvement
in the allocation and efficiency of water use. The model is applied to the Maipo river basin in Chile. Economic benefits to
water use are evaluated for different demand management instruments, including markets in tradable water rights, based
on production and benefit functions with respect to water for the agricultural and urban-industrial sectors. © 2000 Elsevier

1. Introduction
With growing scarcity and increasing competition
for water across sectors, the need for efficient, equitable, and sustainable water allocation policies has increased in importance in water resources management.
These policies can best be examined at the river basin
level, which links essential hydrologic, economic,
agronomic, and institutional relationships as well as
water uses and users and their allocation decisions.
To carry out this analysis, an integrated economichydrologic modeling framework at the basin level
has been developed that accounts for the interactions

between water allocation, farmer input choice, agricultural productivity, non-agricultural water demand,
and resource degradation in order to estimate the
social and economic gains from improvement in the
allocation and efficiency of water use. An application
to the Maipo river basin in Chile is presented. The
following sections give an overview on the research
site, introduce the modeling framework, and present
results of the model application.

2. The Maipo river basin
The Maipo river basin, located in a key agricultural region in the metropolitan area of central Chile,
is a prime example of a "mature water economy"
(see Randall, 1981) with growing water shortages

and increasing competition for scarce water resources
across sectors. The basin is characterized by a very
dynamic agricultural sector - serving an irrigated
area of about 127,000 ha (out of a total catchment area
of 15,380 km 2 ) - and a rapidly growing industrial
and urban sector - in particular in and surrounding the capital city of Santiago with a population of
more than 5 million people. More than 90% of the
irrigated area depends on water withdrawals from
surface flows. Annual flows in the Maipo river average 4445 million m 3 . River fluctuations are predominantly glacial in nature, with considerable flows in
summer (November-February) and very pronounced
reductions in winter (April-June).
In the mid-1990s, total water withdrawals at the
off-take level in the Maipo river basin were estimated
at 2144 million m3 . Agriculture accounted for 64% of
total withdrawals, domestic uses for 25%, and industry for the remaining 11%. The basin includes eight
large irrigation districts with areas of 1300-45,000 ha.
Irrigated area in the basin has been gradually declining due to increasing demands by the domestic and
industrial sectors for both water and land resources,
among other factors. By the mid-1970s, urban Santiago had already encroached on more than 30,000 ha of
productive irrigated land (Court Moock et al., 1979).
However, the closeness to the capital city also provides
a profitable outlet for high-value crop production both
for the local market and for the dynamic export sector.
The largest municipal water company, EMOS, supplies about 85% of Santiago's population as well as
other urban areas. It owns about 17% of the volume of
flow in the upper Maipo river, plus the storage of the El
Yeso reservoir with a capacity of about 256 million m 3
(Donoso, 1997). Supplies for industrial consumption
are drawn from the drinking-water distribution networks as well as from privately owned wells and, in
a few cases, from irrigation canals. All hydropower
stations in the basin are of the run-of-the river type.
Competition among the different water users and
uses, in particular, agriculture and domestic and industrial water uses, is increasing rapidly. According
to Anton (1993), agricultural areas are mostly flood
in·igated, and irrigation efficiencies range from 20
to 60% depending on local conditions. EMOS estimates an increase in domestic water demand of about
330 million m3 between 1997 and 2022, which it intends to meet chiefly through better use of existing

water rights, the purchase of additional rights from irrigation districts, and additional extraction of groundwater. However, in the past, EMOS has been unable
to purchase sufficient shares from irrigation districts,
and both industry and agriculture are competing for
groundwater sources at levels surpassing the recharge
capacities of the aquifers in the metropolitan area
(Hearne, 1998; Bolelli, 1997). Moreover, increasing
competition for scarce water resources in the basin
has led to growing pollution problems that have yet to
be addressed by policy solutions (Anton, I 993). Although Chile has established the economic instrument
of markets in tradable water rights following the Water
Law of 1981, which promotes the allocation of water
to the uses with the highest values, room for improvement in the areas of water rights for environmental
and hydropower (non-consumptive) uses has become
evident. These challenges in the Maipo basin will be
addressed with the integrated economic-hydrologic
modeling framework introduced in the following.

3. The river basin model
3.1. Modeling approach
The river basin modeling system is developed as a
node-link network, in which nodes represent physical
entities and links represent the connection between
these entities (Fig. 1). The nodes included in the network are: (1) source nodes, such as rivers, reservoirs,
and groundwater aquifers; and (2) demand nodes,
such as irrigation fields, industrial plants, and households. Each distribution node is a location where
water is diverted to different sites for beneficial use.
The inflows to these nodes include water flows from
the headwaters of the river basin and rainfall drainage
entering the entities. No prior storage is assumed for
the river nodes. A number of agricultural and municipal and industrial (M&I) demand sites or nodes
have been spatially connected to the basin network.
Agricultural demand sites are delineated according
to the irrigation districts. At each agricultural demand site, water is allocated to a series of crops,
according to their water requirements and economic
profitability. Both crop area and yield are determined
endogenously in the model. Two demand sites have
been allocated to the major urban area, Santiago.

An existing hydrologic model, successfully applied
to the Amu Darya and Syr Darya river basins in Central
Asia, has been adapted to the Chilean context (McKinney and Cai, 1997). In addition, a prototype economic
optimization model has been developed in order to estimate economic returns to water use. Although the
model has been developed as an optimization model,
simulation components have been included to better
solve the complex optimization problem. Hydrologic
flow and salinity balance and tranport are simulated
endogenously within the optimization model and an
external crop-water simulation model is used to estimate the crop yield function, with water, salinity and
irrigation technology as variables.

Both instream and off-stream water uses are considered in the model. Instream uses include flows for
waste dilution and hydropower generation. Off-stream
uses include water diversion for agriculture and M&I
water uses. The valuation of instream and off-stream
uses is implemented in a unified economic objective
function, which is constrained by hydrologic, environmental, and institutional relations. Water demand is
determined endogenously within the model by using
empirical agronomic production functions (yield versus water, irrigation technology, salinity) and an M&I
water demand function based on a market inverse demand function. Water supply is determined through
the hydrologic water balance in the river basin with

36

extension to the irrigated crop fields at each irrigation demand site. Water demand and water supply
are then integrated into an endogenous system and
balanced based on the economic objective of maximizing benefits from water use, including irrigation,
hydropower, and M&I benefits. Both water quantity
and water quality in terms of salinity are simulated
in the model. The salt concentration in the return
flow from irrigated areas is explicitly calculated in
the model. This allows the endogenous consideration of this externality with respect to upstream and
downstream irrigation districts. The model includes
all the essential relationships of these components in
a !-year time horizon with a monthly time step.

3.2. Model components

A curve-linear relationship is assumed between crop
yield and seasonally applied non-saline water. Crop
yield is simulated under given water application, irrigation technology (the Christiensen Uniformity Coefficient or CUC), and irrigation water salinity. Based on
these simulation results, a regression function of crop
yield with water application, irrigation uniformity,
and salinity was derived through the estimation of the
parameters ao-a2 and bo-bs in Eq. (1). The function,
with specific parameters that have been estimated for
all crops in the model, is directly used in the optimization model to calculate crop yields with varying
water application, salt concentration, and cue.
The crop yield function is specified as follows:
Ya

=

Ymax[ao

+

G]

(wi/ Emax)

+ a2ln(wi/ Emax)]

(1)

where
Thematically, the modeling framework includes
three components: (1) hydrologic components, including the water and salt balance in reservoirs, river
reaches and aquifers within the river basin; (2) water
use components, including water for irrigation and
M&I water uses; and (3) economic components, including the calculation of benefits from irrigation,
hydropower, and M&I demand sites.
Hydrologic relations and processes are based on the
flow network, which is an abstracted representation of
the spatial relationships between the physical entities
in the basin. The major hydrologic relations/processes
include: flow transport and balance from river outlets/reservoirs to crop fields or M&I demand sites;
salt transport and balance from river outlets/reservoirs
to irrigated crop fields; return flows from irrigated
and urban areas; interaction between surface and
groundwater; evapotranspiration in irrigated areas,
and hydropower generation as well as physical bounds
on storage, flows, diversions and salt concentrations.
The mathematical expressions for these relations, as
well as the calculation of deep percolation, return
flow from agricultural and M&I demand sites, and
the interaction between surface and groundwater can
be found in Rosegrant et al. (1999). It is assumed
that the water supply starts from rivers and reservoirs.
Effective rainfall is calculated outside of the model,
and included into the model as a constant parameter.
The agronomic relations involved in the simulation
model are adapted from Dinar and Letey (1996), (see
also Letey and Dinar, 1986, and Dinar et al., 1991).

and where Ya is the crop yield (metric tons (mt)/ha),
Ymax the maximum attainable yield (mt/ha), ao, a 1, a2
are regression coefficients, bo-bs are regression coefficients, Wi is infiltrated water (mm), Emax the maximum evapotranspiration (mm), c the salt concentration
in water application (dS/m), and u the Christiensen
Uniformity Coefficient (CUC).
Uniformity (CUC) is used as a surrogate for both
irrigation technology and irrigation management activities. The CUC value varies from approximately 50
for flood irrigation, to 70 for furrow irrigation, 80 for
sprinklers, and 90 for drip irrigation, and also varies
with management activities. By including explicit
representation of technology, the choice of water
application technology can be determined endogenously. The profit from agricultural demand sites is
equal to crop revenue minus fixed crop cost, irrigation technology improvement cost, and water supply
cost. The function for profits from irrigation (VA) at
demand site dm, is specified as follows:
VA(dm)

= LA(dm, cp)Ya(dm, cp)p(dm, cp)
cp

- LA(dm, cp) (fc(dm, cp)

+ tc(dm, cp))

A typical crop yield function for wheat in the Maipo
river basin is shown in Fig. 2. The function drives the
seasonal water allocation among crops, but is not able
to distribute the diverted water among crop growth
stages according to the water demanded by each stage.
In order to achieve consistency with the water balance
in the hydrologic system -- to fill the gap between the
agronomy and hydrology in the optimization model
- an empirical yield-evapotranspiration relationship
given by Doorenbos and Kassam (1979) has been used
to account for the stage effect. This relationship was
applied by including a penalty term into the objective
function, based on the maximum stage yield deficit
(see below for the specification of the penalty term).
The penalty drives the water application according to
the water demands in crop growth stages.

= 70, Salinity = 0.7 dS/m).

The net benefit function for M&I water use is derived from an inverse demand function for water. Net
benefit is calculated as water use benefit minus water
supply cost.
VM(w)=wopo/(1

+a) [Cw/wo)a +2a + 1]- wwp

where VM is the benefit from M&I water use (US$),
wo the maximum water withdrawal (m 3 ), po the willingness to pay for additional water at full use (US$),
a is lie, e the price elasticity of demand (currently
-0.45).
The function is based on synthesis of partial secondary data and in its current form only applies
to surface water. The willingness to pay for water
at full use is estimated at US$ 0.35 per m3 . The
per unit value of water for M&I was estimated at
3.5 times the per unit value of water in agriculture, based on an iterative search process on value
versus water demand, so that water withdrawal to
irrigation and to M&I in the base year model solution matches historical values. The small amount of
local groundwater use (about 12% of annual M&l
withdrawals or 95 million m3 ) is treated as a fixed
amount. Fig. 3 shows the relationship between water

Benefits from power generation are relatively small
in the Maipo Basin compared to off-stream water uses.
The profit from power generation (VP) at a power
station, pwst, is calculated as

to maximize economic profit from water supply for
irrigation, M&l water use, and hydroelectric power
generation, subject to institutional, physical, and other
constraints. The objective function is specified as
follows:

where power is the power production, for each power

reservoir head for stations with dams, as well as hydropower generating capacity and efficiency; pprice is
the price of power production for each power station
(US$/kWh); and pcost is the cost of power production,
for each power station (US$/kW h).
The model also includes a series of institutional
rules, including minimum required water supply to a
demand site, minimum and maximum crop production, flow requirement through a river reach for environmental and ecological purposes, and maximum

where dft is the stage deficit, ky the yield response
factor, and Ea the actual evapotranspiration (mm), as
defined in Doorenbos and Kassam ( 1979).

3.3. Model solution
The model has been coded in the modeling language
of the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS)
(Brooke et a!., 1988), a high-level modeling system
for mathematical programming problems. Since the
model is highly non-linear and includes a large number of variables and equations, it is solved in two steps.
In the first step, the salinity variable is fixed. The solution of this model is used for the initial values of
the variables in the second model with variable salt
concentration (see Cai, 1999).

4. Results and policy analysis
The focus of the modeling in this paper is on
the agriculture sector and to a lesser extent on the
non-agricultural water sectors.

4.1. Basin-optimizing solution ('baseline')
Assumptions in the basin-optimizing solution include a water price in M&I demand sites of US$
0.1 per m 3 and in agricultural demand sites of US$
0.04 per m 3 . Crop technology is fixed at CUC equal

39

to 70. Moreover, it is assumed that 15% of the inflow is reserved for environmental (instream) uses.
The source salinity is 0.3 g/1. No water right is set up
and water withdrawals to demand sites depend on their
respective demands with the objective of maximizing
basin benefits.
The model incorporates 15 crops, but the five main
crops with regard to harvested (irrigated) area are
annual forage, corn, grapes, peach and other orchard
trees, and wheat. Table I presents the production
for these crops determined by the model for the irrigation demand sites in the basin, compared with
the actual production data for 1994-1996. As can be
seen, the basin-optimizing solution estimates a higher
overall production, compared to the 1994-1996 values. Moreover, the solution favors the crops with
higher profit per unit of water supplied, such as peach
and grapes. Table 2 shows the baseline harvested
area derived from the model and a comparison with
the actual situation in the basin in the mid-1990s.
The total harvested area estimated by the model is
146,007 ha, compared to an area under production in
1994-1996 of 127, Ill ha. Again, crops that demand
large amounts of water and/or have lower economic
values account for relatively less area in the model
result compared to the actual data. Moreover, water withdrawals in the M&I demand sites reach the
benefit-maximizing demand level at 1457 million m3 .
Under the baseline, total effective rainfall is estimated at 116 million m3 . Total water withdrawals are

estimated at 3817 million m 3 , 86% of the total inflows
of 4445 million m 3 . Water withdrawals are lowest in
the months of June and July, as only perennial crops
are present during this time. An apparent excess
use of surface water - withdrawals exceed source
flows - during the months of January-March and
November-December can be explained with the high
level of return flows that are being reused during these
months. Total return flows amount to 872 million m 3
or 20% of total inflows. Actual crop evapotranspiration is estimated at 954 million m3, 99.7% of the total
potential crop evapotranspiration of 956 million m 3 .
This value compares well with the data estimated in
Donoso (1997) of 972 million m 3 . According to the
model results, total agricultural water withdrawals

amount to 2360 million m 3 , which again is close to
the 2107 million m3 estimated in Donoso (1997). The
difference can be explained, in part, by the different
irrigation efficiencies. The overall efficiency estimated
by local experts is about 45%, whereas the efficiency
according to model results is 40.4%.

4.2. Sensitivity analysis
Four sensitivity analyses are presented in the following to test the robustness of the model results:
changes in hydrologic levels, irrigation technology cost, crop price, and source salinity (Table 3).
According to the sensitivity analyses, M&I water
withdrawals and benefits barely change with the

changing range of technology cost, crop price, and
source salinity under conditions of normal flow. This is
because, at normal inflows, the M&I demand sites can
withdraw up to their benefit-maximizing level within
the varying range of those parameters. However, M&I
withdrawals and benefits do vary in the dry-year case
(see Table 4).
With a reduction of normal inflows by half, water withdrawals and benefits for both agricultural and
M&I demand sites decline sharply. Agricultural profits decrease by 37% and M&I benefits decline by 9%
compared to normal inflows. Moreover, water withdrawals plunge by 42% for irrigation and by 13% in
M&I demand sites. Thus, in the case of drought, the
agriculture sector is much more affected. Agricultural
water withdrawals are not sensitive to the cost of irrigation technology and profits from irrigation vary
only slightly with changes in technology cost. Proportional changes over all crop prices in the range of
±25% have only small effects on irrigation water withdrawals. However, farmer incomes from irrigation are
significantly affected. With a reduction of crop prices
by 25%, irrigation water withdrawals decline by 5%,
whereas profits from irrigation drop by 60%.
A doubling of the source salinity leads to an increase in irrigation water withdrawals for salt leaching
by 5%. Increased salt leaching reduces profits from
irrigation by 14%. Moreover, changes in the salinity
level influence crop patterns, with a decline in the harvested area of crops with lower salt tolerance. With
doubled source salinity, the area planted to maize declines from 10 to 8% of total area planted whereas the
area planted with wheat - a more salt tolerant crop
- increases from 15 to 18%.

incomes in the irrigation and M&I sectors for a
drought-year case (50% of normal inflows). With an
increase in the water price for irrigation from zero to
US$ 0.08 per m 3 , water withdrawals for agriculture
decline by 5%, from 1387 to 1326 million m3 . However, changes in the water price barely affect the crop
area. Irrigated area is maintained because farmers
shift on the margin to more water efficient crops and
reduce water use per hectare. Although both water
withdrawals and irrigated crop area barely change
with varying water prices, farmer incomes can drop
drastically under this 'administrative price scenario':
by 42% from US$ 224 million to US$ 130 million
with increasing prices. M&l benefits, on the other
hand, increase steadily with continuing water price
increases in agriculture, from US$ 550 million to US$
570 million and M&I water withdrawals increase by
3.6%. With water prices already quite high (higher
than what most farmers in the United States pay),
further price increases are a blunt instrument for influencing water demand. Under these circumstances,
water markets that allow farmers to retain the income
from sales of water may be preferable.

4.3. Economic analysis of water trading
There are two fundamental strategies for dealing
with water scarcity in river basins, supply management and demand management; the former involves
activities to locate, develop, and exploit new sources
of water, and the latter addresses the incentives and
mechanisms that promote water conservation and
efficient use of water.
The primary alternative to quantity-based allocation
of water is incentive-based allocation, either through
volumetric water prices or through markets in tradable

42

water rights. The empirical evidence shows that farmers are price responsive in their use of irrigation water
(Rosegrant et al., 1995; Gardner, 1983). The choice
between administered prices and markets should be
largely a function of which system has the lowest
administrative and transaction costs (TC). Markets in
tradable water rights can reduce information costs; increase farmer acceptance and participation; empower
water users; and provide security and incentives for
investment and for internalizing the external costs of
water uses. Market allocation can provide flexibility
in response to water demands, permitting the selling
and purchasing of water across sectors, across districts, and across time by opening opportunities for
exchange where they are needed. The outcomes of the
exchange process reflect the water scarcity condition
in the area with water flowing to the uses where its
marginal value is highest (Rosegrant and Binswanger,
1994; Rosegrant, 1997). Markets also provide the
foundation for water leasing and option contracts,
which can quickly mitigate acute, short-term urban
water shortages while maintaining the agricultural
production base (Michelsen and Young, 1993). Establishment of markets in tradable property rights does
not imply free markets in water. Rather, the system
would be one of managed trade, with institutions in
place to protect against third-party effects and potential negative environmental effects that are not
eliminated by the change in incentives. Tradable water rights could lead to massive transfers of water to
urban and industrial centers. Therefore, farmers need
to be protected by adequate institutions and organizations. The Chilean Water Law of 1981 established the
basic characteristics of property rights over water as
a proportional share over a variable flow or quantity.
Changes in the allocation of water within and between sectors are realized through markets in tradable
water rights (for details, see Gazmuri Schleyer and
Rosegrant, 1996; Hearne and Easter, 1995).
The integrated economic-hydrologic river basin
model allows for a fairly realistic representation and
analysis of water markets. Water trading in the basin
is constrained by the hydrologic balance in the river
basin network; water is traded taking account of the
physical and technical constraints of the various demand sites, reflecting their relative profitability in
trading prices; water trades reflect the relative seasonal water scarcity in the basin that is influenced

by both basin inflows and the cropping pattern in
agricultural demand sites (whereas the M&I water
demands are more stable); and negative externalities,
like increased salinity in downstream reaches due to
incremental irrigation water withdrawals upstream,
are endogenous to the model framework.

4.3.1. Model formulation for water trading
To extend the model to water trading analysis, in
a first step, a shadow price - water withdrawal relationship is determined for each demand site. For
this, the model is run separately for each demand site
with varying water withdrawals as inputs and shadow
prices or marginal values as output derived from the
water balance equations (each irrigation demand site
includes a water balance equation for each of up to 15
crops). These shadow prices are then averaged over all
crops to obtain one shadow price for each water supply level for each demand site. Based on these input
and output values a regression function is estimated
for the shadow price- water withdrawal relationship
for each demand site. Fig. 4 shows the model results
and the regression relationship between shadow price
and water withdrawals for an agricultural demand site.
Water rights are allocated proportionally to total inflows based on historical withdrawals for M&I areas
and on the harvested (irrigated) area for agricultural
demand sites. Thus, with reduced inflows, the realized
volumes of the water rights change without changes in
the rights structure. The water right refers to surface
water only. To determine the lower bound for profits
from water trade by demand site (it is assumed that
no demand site can lose from trading), the model is
solved for the case of water rights without trading.
Finally, the regression relationships of shadow price

versus water withdrawal for all agricultural and M&I
demand sites, the water rights, and other water trading related constraints (see Rosegrant et a!., 1999) are
added to the basin model. It is assumed that the trading price for each demand site is equal to its shadow
price for water. This model is then solved to determine
the water trading price, wtp, and the volume of water
bought and sold by demand site.
Trade is allowed on a monthly basis and throughout the basin and TC are incurred by both buyer and
seller (US$ 0.04 per m 3 ). Up to 4 months of the realized monthly water right can be traded as the monthly
balances had been found as too tight of a constraint
on water supply for crop growth.

decision-maker optimizing benefits for the entire
basin (BO); water rights with no trading permitted
(WR), and water rights with trading (WRT). The
salinity variable is fixed for all three water trading
scenarios. The results compare two cases for each of
these three scenarios: hydrologic level at 100% of
the normal inflow and at 60% of the normal inflow
(Table 5). In addition, three TC scenarios are analyzed
based on normal inflow (Table 6). The description of
results will concentrate on the drought-year scenario
(case B, 60% of normal inflow), as the benefits vary
more clearly by economic instrument employed.
In the case of a drought year, total water withdrawals
are highest for the basin optimizing case (BO), as each
and every demand site can withdraw according to its
monthly needs subject to an optimum result for the
basin as a whole. These needs are thus only confined
by physical parameters, such as relative location in

the basin and institutional requirements. Water withdrawals decline substantially in the WR case, relative
to BO, when withdrawals are limited to the respective
water right and trading is not allowed. Agricultural
withdrawals are often actually below the actual water
right, because dry-season flows are inadequate to fulfill all crop water requirements. Another reason is that,
in about half of the months, only perennial crops are
grown, and thus withdrawals are far below the allotted
flow.
When water can be traded, irrigation withdrawals
actually decline further, albeit not very much. Irrigation withdrawals decline because the irrigation
districts sell part of their water right to the M&I demand sites, thereby reaping substantial profits. In the
dry-year case, a total water volume of 296 million m 3
is traded, about 11% of total dry-year inflows. In the
case of normal inflows, 264 million m3 of water is
traded, about 6% of total inflow. M&I areas are the
main buyers in both cases, purchasing virtually all the
water offered by the irrigation districts. All irrigation
districts are net sellers of water over the course of
the year. Under the drought-year case, only district
AS purchases 0.2 million m 3 of water to maintain its
cropping pattern that features the largest share of
higher-valued, perennial crops (grapes, peach, among
others, see Table 2). In the case of normal inflows, on
the other hand, the marginal value of water is much
lower, and two agricultural demand sites, A6 and AS,
purchase water (0.2 million m 3 and 1O.S million m 3 ,
respectively) to supplement their crop production in
some months; however, overall both districts are net
sellers of water.
As the WR system does not allow the transfer of
water to more beneficial uses, benefits from water
uses are significantly reduced by locking the resource
into relatively low valued uses during shortages. As

a result, total net benefits are less than one-half of
the optimizing solution (US$ 3S9 million compared
with US$ S74 million). By permitting trading, water moves from less productive agricultural uses into
higher-valued urban water uses while at the same
time benefiting farm incomes. Total benefits in the
M&I demand sites almost triple, compared to the WR
case, but gains are also significant for the irrigation
districts and each district can increase net profits, by
between 6 and 62%, depending on their respective
physical and other characteristics. Total net profits of
the sector increase by about 20%, from US$ 253 million to US$ 301 million. In irrigation districts Al-AS
and A7, total net profits under the WRT scenario are
even higher than for the basin-optimizing case. This
is due to the higher value of the scarcer water and
the resulting benefits from trade and does not occur
in case A with normal inflow levels.
Moreover, net profits from crop production decline
only slightly with trading: from US$ 253 million to
US$ 244 million. Total crop production also barely
declines, from l.S66 million mt to 1.729 million mt.
In addition, the proportion of higher-value perennial crops increases substantially from the WR to
the WRT scenarios, from 14 to 19% for grapes and
from 13 to 16% for peach, for example. These results
not only show the advantages of the water market
approach compared to the WR case, but also to the
administrative price scenario presented in the sensitivity analysis, in which water is also reallocated from
agricultural to non-agricultural uses, but at a punitive
cost to agricultural incomes.
In the shift from fixed proportional water rights to
trade, total benefits to the basin increase from 45% of
the omniscient decision-maker (BO scenario) to SO%.
However, total benefits under water trading are actually even closer to the pure optimum than shown here,

M. W Rosegrant et a/. I Agricultural Economics 24 (2000) 33-46

because no monitoring/transaction costs are charged
for the omniscient decision-maker when in fact the
cost would likely be very high.
For the water trading scenario, it is currently assumed that both buyer and seller contribute equally to
TC (US$ 0.04perm3 ). Three TC scenarios were run
in addition to this base trading scenario: zero TC, US$
0.1 per m3 , and US$ 0.2 per m3 . The results are shown
in Table 6. As can be expected, water withdrawals
decline with increasing TC, and the volume of water
traded plunges by more than half, from 278 million m3
for the case without TC to 138 million m3 for the
case with TC of US$ 0.2 per m3 . This is due, in part,
to the fact that the TC are quite high relative to the
shadow prices for water, which range from US$ 0.18
to 1.27 per m3 . Total net benefits decline substantially,
from US$ 871 million at zero TC to US$ 755 million
at TC of US$ 0.2 per m3 ; gains from trade also drop
sharply, from US$ 122 million to only US$ 6 million,
respectively. Thus, making trading more efficient (reducing TC) has significant benefits, increasing both
the volume and the benefits from trade.

Although these preliminary results show the effectiveness of the model for policy analysis and water
allocation in the river basin, additional research is
needed. During a second research phase, the agricultural production functions will be extended to include
inputs in addition to land, water, and irrigation technology, such as agricultural chemicals and labor. In
addition, the urban water demand functions will be
re-estimated based on empirical data and disaggregated into household and industrial water demands.
Moreover, the power generation will be calibrated
to local parameters. Based on this extension, more
comprehensive policy analysis will be carried out.
Existing institutions regarding water rights, priority
allocations, and additional institutional realities will
be better represented based on local data. Finally, direct cooperation will be established with the relevant
government authorities and water user associations in
the basin, with the goal of institutionalizing the model
as a decision support system for basin water policy.

5. Conclusions
This paper presents a prototype river basin model
that includes essential hydrologic, agronomic and
economic relationships, and reflects the interrelationships of water and salinity, food production,
economic welfare, and environmental consequences.
The model is applied to the Maipo river basin in
Chile, but due to its generic form and structure can
be applied to other basins.
The model results show the benefits of water rights
trading with water moving into higher valued agricultural (and M&l) uses. Net profits in irrigated agriculture increase substantially compared to the case of
proportional use rights for demand sites. Moreover,
agricultural production does not decline significantly.
Net benefits for irrigation districts can be even higher
than for the basin-optimizing case, as farmers reap
substantial benefits from selling their unused water
rights to M&l areas during the months with little or
no crop production. Finally, making trading more efficient, that is, reducing transaction costs, has significant benefits, increasing both the amount of trading
and the benefits from trade.
