Abstract
Brennan, J.P., 1989. Spillover effects of international agricultural research: CIMMYT-based semidwarfwheats in Australia. Agric. Econ., 3: 323-332.
The spillover effects of agricultural research are of interest because research-induced supply
shifts in non-target regions can reduce the benefits for producers in the target regions. The introduction of semi-dwarfing genes in wheat into Australia provides an example of spillover from the
CIMMYT program. Australia's wheat-growing environments were not those for which the CIMMYT material was specifically targeted. However, some of these lines were introduced into Australia and used in breeding programs to produce important supply shifts in Australia. An examination is made of the effects that the spillover had in Australia.
Using an index of varietal improvement, with its attendant qualifications, an estimate of the
extent of that shift resulting from the CIMMYT -based varieties was obtained. While the extent
varied widely between states, the shift was found to be between 0.2 and 7.7%, with an overall
average for Australia of 3.5% by 1983. On the basis of an assumption of perfectly elastic export
demand for Australian wheat, the estimated total cost savings to Australian producers were US$747
million (in 1983-84 dollars) for the period 1974 to 1983, or an average ofUS$75 million per year.
The annual contribution of Australia to CIMMYT has averaged approximately US$340,000 in
recent years, while the average annual expenditure on wheat breeding in Australia has been US$4
to 5 million. On the basis of pedigrees, approximately two-thirds of the cost savings of CIMMYTbased varieties could be attributed to CIMMYT per se, with the remaining one-third attributable
to the inputs of the Australian wheat breeders.

Introduction
Mexican dwarf wheat varieties originally were developed by the Cooperative
Wheat Improvement Program of the Mexican Ministry of Agriculture and the
Rockefeller Foundation "to solve Mexico's wheat production problem"
(CIMMYT, 1969, p. 55). Subsequent research has been carried out by CIMMYT in Mexico to develop "high-yielding, widely adapted, semidwarf spring0169-5150/89/$03.50

habit bread wheats that were suitable for immediate release in key developing
countries" ( CIMMYT, 1984, p. 11). The varieties developed have been grown
in many areas apart from the 'target' regions in the developing countries.
The net benefits of agricultural research in a tradable commodity such as
wheat for its 'target' region are influenced by the spillover of the effects of that
research into the rest of the world, with which the target region competes for
a share of the world market. Edwards and Freebairn ( 1984) showed that the
greater the extent to which the research innovations are adopted in other regions, the lower the net benefits for the target region. Davis et al. (1987) have
further developed the incorporation of spillover effects into the analytical
framework for the evaluation of research.
In this paper, the effects of wheat research at CIMMYT on the production
from the generally dryland areas in Australia are identified. An attempt is
made to quantify the extent of those spillover effects from the CIMMYT
program.
Semi-dwarf wheats in Australia
Semi-dwarf wheats were first introduced into Australia from the United
States of America in 1956 (Pugsley, 1974). From the late 1950s and early 1960s,
material was also imported from the Mexican program conducted by the Rockefeller Foundation, precursor of the CIMMYT program. The imported lines

were not released directly for commercial growing by Australian farmers (generally because of inadequate milling or baking quality). All were subject to
further crossing before commercial varieties were released. This delayed the
initial adoption of semi-dwarf wheats in Australia compared to most other
countries (Brennan, 1986a). The first semi-dwarf bread wheat cultivars were
released for commercial production in Australia in 1973.
In this paper Australian varieties which had a CIMMYT line in their parentage are classified as CIMMYT -based varieties. Between 1973 and 1984, 58
new wheat varieties were released for commercial production in Australia; of
these, 45 (or 78%) were CIMMYT-based varieties, seven (12%) were semidwarfs of other origin, and six (10%) were non-semi-dwarf. The spread of
CIMMYT -based varieties in Australia from the first release was rapid-see
Brennan (1986a) for more detail. By 1976, over 14% of the total Australian
wheat area was sown to CIMMYT -based varieties. By 1983 the percentage had
reached 45%, or 5.8 million ha, and a further 8% was sown to semi-dwarfs of
other origin. There were wide differences in the rate of adoption in different
states (Fig. 1).
Yield advantage of CIMMYT-based varieties

Although virtually all semi -dwarfs released commercially in Australia have
involved selection from, or further crossing with, CIMMYT material, other
facets of progress in breeding have been incorporated at the same time. Thus,
ideally, the study should make a comparison between the progress (in yield
and quality) which has actually occurred in the presence of CIMMYT material
and that which would have occurred without it.
Several simplifying assumptions were made in estimating the yield advantage of CIMMYT-based varieties over other varieties, including (a) that the

326

CIMMYT-based varieties led to a permanent upward shift in yield potential:
(b) that the yield advantage from trials can be used to indicate the yield advantages on farms; (c) that the yield advantage of CIMMYT -based breeding
lines over other leading lines in the Interstate Wheat Variety Trials over the
period 1975-1982 provided a measure of the inherent yield advantage of CIMMYT-based varieties; and (d) that the varieties chosen by breeders as standard check varieties in the trials do indeed represent the standard in each state,
and that the lines being compared are representative of the new wheats in the
process of being released.
The procedure for estimating the yield advantage for CIMMYT-based varieties, as detailed by Brennan (1986a), was as follows. The pedigree of each
line in the Interstate Wheat Variety Trials was examined and was classified as
'CIMMYT-based' if either of its parents was from the CIMMYT program or
had CIMMYT material in its parentage. The mean yields for the 'CIMMYTbased' and the 'other' groups were then calculated for all trial sites in each
state for each year between 1975 and 1982. The overall average yield of each
group was then estimated for each state for the full period from a weighted
average of the annual mean yields. In total, data covered 176 site-years, with
an average of 25 lines at each site and an average of four sites per state per
year.
The overall average advantage of CIMMYT -based lines over other lines was
7.1% (Table 1), although there was wide variability between states. The ranking of these mean yield advantages by state is broadly in line with the rate of
adoption of CIMMYT-based varieties in each state.
Index of varietal improvement

Given the average yield advantages for each state, and the data on adoption
of the varieties, it is possible to calculate a simplified relative yield index or
'index of varietal improvement' (Silvey, 1981; Brennan, 1984). This index
combines the yields obtained in trials with data on the varieties being grown
by farmers, to provide a measure of the contribution that new varieties make
to increasing wheat yields.
A modified index of varietal improvement is calculated as follows:
lit= 100+ (Vi Pit) /100

where lit is the index in state i in year t; Vi is the percentage yield advantage
of CIMMYT-based varieties in state i; and Pit is the proportion of the area
sown to CIMMYT-based varieties in state i in year t. Thus in New South
Wales, with a yield advantage of9.0% (Vi=9.0), and 71.0% of the area sown
to CIMMYT-based varieties in 1979 (Pit=0.710), the index for 1979 is 106.39.
The index has a base value of 100 for all years in which these varieties were
not grown in the state.

327

These indexes have been calculated for each state for each year from 1974
to 1983. The index increases steadily for each state with the increasing adoption of these varieties. The index increased between 1973 and 1983 by 6.6% for
New South Wales, 5.3% for Victoria, 7.2% for Queensland, 2.4% for South
Australia and 0.3% for Western Australia. The overall increase over this period
for Australia was 3.6%.
Godden ( 1985, 1987) pointed out that relative yield indexes are a biased
estimator of genetic improvement unless there is no interaction between the
varieties and the level of inputs used. A brief examination of input levels in
Australia (Brennan, 1986a) showed that, except in Western Australia (where
CIMMYT -based varieties were only of minor importance), there was scant
evidence of any major changes in input levels for wheat production in Australian over the period since the early 1970s. Thus the extent of the possible bias
in this study, while unknown, is argued to be likely to be relatively small.
On the other hand, if the CIMMYT-based varieties were adopted mainly in
the areas where their superiority over other varieties was greatest, then the
index of varietal improvement would understate the true contribution of these
CIMMYT-based varieties. Given the other limitations on the precision of this
index, it is not appropriate to attempt to estimate the size of this bias. Nevertheless, it is a possible further source of inaccuracy in the results of this study.
Estimate of shift in Australia's wheat supply curve

Edwards and Freebairn ( 1984) define the increase in supply as a vertical
downwards shift in the supply curve through a lowering of costs per unit. An
approximation of the equivalent percentage reduction in costs for a given percentage yield increase can be obtained from the change in the index of varietal
improvement. If the cost of growing the marginal hectare is C and the yields
are Y(tlha), the marginal tonne of production will cost CIYper t. If the yield
increases by the proportion A with no increase in costs per ha, then the cost
pert falls to CI [ Y ( 1 +A) ] , and the proportional fall in costs pert is A I (1 +A).
Thus, a costless (in terms perceived directly by farmers) increase in yields
of 3.6% for Australia is equivalent to a fall in costs of 3.5%. This is the extent
to which the overall Australian supply curve is estimated to have shifted downwards as a spillover from the Mexican wheat breeding programs. The shift thus
calculated for each state was: Queensland 6.7%, New South Wales 6.2%, Victoria 5.0%, South Australia 2.4% and Western Australia 0.2%.
Effect on prices for Australian wheat

It is possible that the increased supply resulting from the semi-dwarfs in
Australia has affected the prices received for Australia's wheat exports. If the

export market is perfectly elastic (that is, Australia is a price-taker on the
world wheat market), the increased supply would not have influenced world
prices. However, there is some debate as to whether Australia faces a perfectly
elastic demand for its export wheat; for example, see Alaouze et al. ( 1978a,b,
1979), Grennes and Johnson (1979) andLongworthandKnopke (1982). The
analysis in the present study is based on the assumption that the export demand is perfectly elastic, as argued by Alaouze et al. (1978a,b) and Longworth
and Knapke ( 1982). To the extent that the market is less than perfectly elastic,
the increased supply would have reduced the price, and the gains indicated by
this analysis would be overstated.
In addition, the large shifts in world wheat supply (measured as increases
in world production) attributed to varieties emanating from CIMMYT
(Anderson et al., 1987) can have had a substantial impact on the world price
for wheat (Edwards and Freebairn, 1984). These effects could have substantial
disbenefits for Australian producers, offset to some extent by benefits for Australian consumers. These effects are not estimated in this paper.
Estimate of cost savings for Australia
If the assumption is made that Australia is a price-taker on the world wheat
market, facing perfectly elastic demand, then the figures derived in this study
allow some broad estimates to be made of the cost savings to Australian producers from CIMMYT-based varieties. This involves continuing the earlier

assumptions that the yield advantage of CIMMYT-based varieties in trials is
the same as that on farms for each state, and that there are no major interactions of these varieties with changes in inputs during the period of analysis.
On the basis of these several assumptions, the annual savings to Australian
wheatgrowers are estimated (in 1983-84 US dollars) as shown in Table 2. Details of the calculations underlying these assumptions are given in Brennan
(1986a). These figures show substantial savings for Australian producers. After
the initial small savings during the early adoption phase, the annual savings
reached US$113 million in 1979, fell to US$34 million in the drought-affected
season of 1982, and increased to US$142 million in 1983. In the period 1974 to
1983, total savings in 1983-84 dollars, compounded at a real interest rate of
5% per annum, were US$747 million, or an average ofUS$75 million per year.
Partitioning contributions

The savings of the CIMMYT-based varieties cannot all be attributed to
CIMMYT, since many of these varieties have large inputs of germplasm and
breeding, evaluation and testing resources from Australian wheat researchers.
It is of interest to examine the relative contribution of the CIMMYT and Australian research programs to these cost savings.
A simplified partitioning of CIMMYT and non-CIMMYT savings uses the
pedigree of each variety to allocate the savings for each according to the origins

of its parents (see Brennan, 1986a, for more details). Thus a variety which is
a direct cross between a CIMMYT line and an Australian line has 50% of its
saving attributed to CIMMYT. A variety which is the product of a cross between two CIMMYT lines is allocated 100% to CIMMYT, even though the
crossing, selection, evaluation and testing were all carried out in Australia.
Such an allocation is arbitrary, and understates the value added by the Australian researchers in testing and release of the varieties. Nevertheless, calculations have been carried out on this basis to provide an indication of the contribution of CIMMYT to the impact of CIMMYT -based varieties in Australia
(Brennan, 1986a). The weighted average of the contribution of CIMMYT
peaked at US$80 million in 1980 (Table 3) and declined to US$66 million (or
46% of the contribution of CIMMYT -based varieties) by 1983 as the varieties
grown in Australia moved further away from the original material imported
from CIMMYT. The CIMMYT contribution averaged approximately US$50
million per year, or 67% ofthe total cost savings from CIMMYT-based varieties over the period 1974 to 1983 (Table 3). Although this analysis is no more
than indicative, the CIMMYT program appears to have made a substantial
direct and indirect contribution to Australian wheat production, mainly through
the use of CIMMYT lines as parents. Subsequently, the new varieties have
been used as parents in further Australian-developed varieties.
Therefore, overall, approximately two-thirds of the supply shift due to CIMMYT-based varieties could be attributed to CIMMYT and one-third to Australian breeders. This reduces the direct cost savings to 2.3%, rather than 3.5%
estimated above for the CIMMYT -based varieties as a whole.
Conclusions

While the aims of the Rockefeller /CIMMYT programs may not have always
appeared to be to the direct benefit of Australian producers, there is evidence
that Australian producers have received important cost savings from the programs in terms of increased yields. These savings appear to far outweigh the
contribution of the Australian Government to CIMMYT. Since 1977, Australia has contributed an average of some US$2.8 million per year to core programs of the Consulative Group in International Agricultural Research Center. Of this, some 12% has gone to CIMMYT and no more than one-half of
that support went to its wheat program (J.R. Anderson, personal communication, 1986). Thus on an annual outlay of some US$340,000, Australia has
received overall cost reductions averaging some US$75 million per year resulting from improved wheat varieties derived from CIMMYT. This compares with
an average annual expenditure on wheat breeding in Australia of US$4 to 5
million (Brennan, 1986b).
These programs appear to have led to substantial supply shifts in other pro-

331

clueing countries, which have had a negative impact on the world wheat price.
Whether the net effect of these programs on Australian wheat producers is
positive cannot be judged until the impact of these shifts in supply in other
producing countries on the world wheat price has been identified. However,
any such impacts will have been detrimental for Australian producers (countered by smaller benefits for Australian consumers), and will run counter to the
effects identified in this paper.
These estimates are only an approximation, but they do reveal that there
can be substantial spillover effects from international agricultural research
programs in which there is free exchange of breeding material and wide access
to breeding nurseries. If Australian production has not significantly affected
world prices, then these spillover effects will not have reduced the benefits for
producers in the regions targeted by the international programs. On the other
hand, if the export elasticity for Australian wheat was finite, the spillover of
these varieties into Australia will have resulted in a fall in world price, thus
transferring some of the benefits from the producers to world wheat consumers.
