Abstract
Results from a 1997 survey of 208 households in the humid forest zone of southern Cameroon indicate that African policy
makers seeking to intensify agricultural production should focus attention on the horticultural sub-sector. The survey, which
gathered information on horticultural production practices, found that the average expenditure on agro-chemical inputs by
horticultural producers using monocrop production systems was 190 US$/ha, which greatly exceeds the FAO reported national average expenditure of 6.50 US$/ha. A logit model of monocrop adoption indicated that the size of land holding per
household had a negative effect on adoption, congruent with population-driven technical change and that increases in unit
transportation costs significantly decreased the probability of adoption. These findings suggest that policy makers should
target horticultural intensification in areas of higher population density and promote investment in rural roads. The age of
the household head had a significant negative and elastic effect on adoption, which in combination with an increase in the
cohort of younger farmers in the rural population induced by macro-economic events contributed to the spread of intensified
horticulture. In the study area, roughly two-thirds of rural households also produce cocoa and the quantity of cocoa produced
was positively associated with adoption of intensive horticultural systems suggesting that export crop promotion indirectly
facilitated diversification of agriculture. Women’s participation in intensive monocrop production was limited and efforts to
promote their greater involvement are recommended.

1. Introduction
Rural poverty remains a pressing problem in Africa
(IFAD, 2001). To meet rapidly growing food demand and raise rural income, it is widely believed

that African farmers must intensify their crop production systems by increasing the amount of inputs
used per unit area of agricultural land. The use of
inorganic and organic fertiliser, improved seed, irrigation and pesticides by farmers in sub-Saharan
Africa is among the lowest in the developing world.
In Cameroon the mean expenditure per ha of fertilisers and pesticides in 2000 is estimated by FAO
at 6.50 US$/ha with the bulk of these expenditures

incurred in the export crop sector (coffee, cocoa and
oil palm).
Low levels of agricultural intensification have
been linked to the non-suitability of agricultural
lands, inappropriate agricultural policies, nonexistent
agro-chemical production capacity, poor infrastructure, weak research and extension institutions, and
the low prices of staple commodities (Reardon et
al., 1997; Zeller et al., 1999). Underdeveloped rural
credit markets also limit agricultural intensification
and productivity growth that depends on the increased use of purchased inputs (von Braun et al.,
1993; Poulton et al., 1998). Intensification is also
commodity-specific with horticultural crops often
among the most intensively produced. The higher
value of horticultural crops relative to staple foods is
a key factor. A comparison of mean monthly tomato
and staple food prices in the Yaounde market in recent
years illustrates the ‘high value’ nature of horticultural crops common to many African food markets
(Fig. 1).
To facilitate agricultural intensification in Africa,
better understanding is needed of those examples
where the process has already taken hold. Contributing towards that end, this paper examines the adoption
of intensified monocrop systems of horticultural production among smallholders in southern Cameroon.
A logit regression of the adoption determinants is

developed and the elasticities of adoption for certain
policy variables estimated.

2. Area description, survey methodology and
adoption model
The study area in southern Cameroon was selected
based on anecdotal observation of the growing importance of intensified horticultural production in this region (Fig. 2). Rural densities lie between 36 and 70
persons per km2 although denser pockets in excess of
150 persons are not uncommon (RGPH, 1993; Santoir,
1995). Population pressures are generally higher than
in most other areas of central Africa, yet lower than
in much of humid west Africa. The climax vegetation
is semi-deciduous moist tropical forest. Mean annual
rainfall ranges from 1350 to 1700 mm distributed in a
bimodal pattern which permits two rain-fed cropping
seasons: the first, from March to June and the second,
from August to November. 25% of rural households
also crop during the dry season from December to
February in inland valley bottoms using hand irrigation or water from hydro-morphic soils (IITA unpublished data).
Up until the spread of monocrop systems of horticultural production beginning in the 1970s, the three
cropping systems which predominated in the farming

systems of the study area were the melon seed field,
the mixed food crop field and the cocoa agroforest.
The first two are annual crop systems that are rotated
with a fallow period in order to restore soil fertility.
As rural populations have grown, fallow periods have
declined and differences in land holdings have become more accentuated. For households with limited
land holdings, the melon seed field, which requires
long fallow periods of 10–15 years, has dropped out
of the farming system. The mixed food crop system
is managed by women and has remained an integral
part of the farming system since pre-colonial times
(Guyer, 1984). This cropping system provides the
bulk of household food supply as well as marketed
surpluses of food crops. Most households cultivated
the field twice in the first and second rainy season
on different sites. With rare exception agro-chemicals
are not applied. Cultivation of cocoa in small agroforests is an important revenue source for approximately two-thirds of households in the area and accounts for approximately one-third of total revenues
in these households (IITA unpublished household
data).
Horticultural crops are marketed from surpluses emanating from the mixed crop field and from specialised
monocrop systems of horticultural production cultivated by men. The latter system is a relatively recent

197

incorporation, first described in the mid-1970s (Guyer,
1984). Discussions with village elders confirm this as
the period in which commercial horticultural production began to develop. An important characteristic of
the monocrop system is a high level of agro-chemical
use.
A randomised two-stage cluster sample of rural
households was conducted in July of 1997 to investigate the importance of horticultural cash crops in
rural livelihoods. The study area was divided into
eight squares of 18 km × 18 km and clusters (villages)
nearest the geographic centre of each square selected
from two strata: (i) those villages lying on all-weather
roads and (ii) those on seasonal roads as indicated
on 1:200,000 topographic maps. Within villages, the
survey team selected households randomly by choosing every nth household. The sampling interval n was
equal to N/13, where N was the counted total number
of households in the village and 13 the desired sample size for each village. A local guide assisted in the
enumeration of households. In all, 16 villages were
sampled and a total of 208 households interviewed
using a structured questionnaire administered in the
local Beti dialect. The questionnaire gathered detailed
production information on the two most important
commercial crops produced by the household. The
survey data were used to characterise practices in
horticulture production, and to model the adoption of
intensive monocrop systems.
The adoption of intensive monocrop production systems was modelled using the logit discrete binary
regression model (Maddala, 1983; Amemiya, 1985).
The model assumes an underlying latent adoption variable yi∗ defined by the relationship:
yi∗ = β xik + ui
where we assume that ui are IN(0, σ 2 ).
However, in practice we observe y defined by
yi = 1,

if yi∗ > 0, y = 0 otherwise

The likelihood function of the logit model is
Prob[Yi = 1] =

exp[xi β]
{1 + exp[xi β]}

If we let xik equal the kth element of the vector
of explanatory variables xi and βk the kth element
of β, then the expression for the derivatives of the

198

And the elasticities of the probability of belonging to
the group of adopters is given by

The model focus is on the determinants of the adoption of intensive monocrop production systems. The
reduced form of the model is
ADOPT = α0 + β1 MEN + β2 WOMEN + β3 CHILD
+ β4 AGE + β5 EDUC + β6 MELON
+ β7 MFOOD + β8 COCOA + β9 WPROD
+ β10 COSTKM,
where the dependent variable (ADOPT) equals one,
if the production system used by the household to
produce its most commercially important horticultural
crop was a monocrop, and otherwise equals zero.
The household endowment of family labour is
expected to positively affect the probability of adoption, given the labour-intensive nature of commercial
horticulture production and relatively undeveloped
local labour markets. Labour variables in the model
include the number of adult males (MEN), adult females (WOMEN), and children under 16 years of
age (CHILD). The age of household heads (AGE)
and their educational attainment (EDUC) capture
differences in the quality of management.
Land endowments play an important role in the intensification process (Boserup, 1965; Binswanger and
McIntire, 1987). In southern Cameroon, the institution
of patrilineal inheritance with an equal division of land
holdings along with very limited land sales and rapid
population growth has led to a decline in the average land holding per farm household. Congruent with
Boserup’s population-driven view of technical change,
this should increase the probability of intensified horticultural production. Accurate measures of farm size
were difficult to obtain through farmer interview, as
land had not been surveyed and local area measures
do not exist. To address this measurement issue, the
number of melon seed fields cropped in the last 12
months (MELON), was used as an instrumental variable. The 10–15 year fallow requirement for this field

implies that only households with large landholdings
can still maintain this system. To test whether intensive horticulture is replacing cultivation of the traditional mixed crop field, a count of the number of these
fields cropped in the last 12 months (MFOOD) was
included in the model.
Research elsewhere (Govereh and Jayne, 1999;
Strasberg et al., 1999) has documented synergy between cash crop and food crop intensification due in
part to the alleviation of liquidity constraints when
credit markets are missing. To test the hypothesis
that cocoa revenues provide liquidity that increases
the probability of intensified moncrop horticultural
production, the level of cocoa production (COCOA)
in the 12 months prior to the interview was included.
Women’s participation in the process of technical change is often constrained by information gaps
and impaired access to productive resources (Bzugu
and Kwaghe, 1997; Orr, 2000). A dummy variable (WPROD), indicating cases where the principal
decision-maker was a women, tests for gender differences in the participation in intensive monocrop
production.
The condition of rural roads and the amount of vehicular traffic affect market access and search and information costs, which have been shown to influence
intensification processes (Odhiambo, 1998; Zang and
Fan, 2001). Although the 16 villages in the sample
are within 100 km of Yaounde, local differences in
road quality and the amount of vehicular traffic can
be significant. The per kilometre cost of personal bush
taxi transport to Yaounde (COSTKM) provides an instrumental measure of these differences and is expected to have a negative impact on the probability of
adoption.

3. Results
All of the 208 households had marketed at least
one horticultural crop in the 12 months prior to the
interview. A remarkable diversity of crops was marketed with the mean household selling nearly 18
different crops. Overall, households identified 34 different crops as among their principal (first and second
rank in importance) sources of horticultural revenues.
Tomato, dessert bananas and green maize were cited
most frequently (Table 1).

Fifty-seven percent of the households produced
their most important market crop using an intensive
horticultural monocrop system, while 43% used the
traditional mixed food crop field to produce market
surpluses. Producers using monocrop systems re-

199

ported expenditures on fertilisers and pesticides of
190 US$/ha (versus 6.50 US$/ha for all agricultural
lands in Cameroon) establishing the monocrop horticultural system as among the most input-intensive
crop systems in Cameroon. Monocrop producers were
more likely to use fertilisers, pesticides, modified soil
tillage and improved seeds to produce horticultural
crops than were producers using the traditional mixed
food crop field (Table 2). They were also on average ten years younger, better educated, and produced
more cocoa than producers using traditional mixed
crop technology (Table 3).
For the adoption model, 170 producer records were
used to analyse the predicted model effects; 38 of the
households visited were unable to supply complete
data for all eleven variables in the model and had to be
dropped from the logit analysis. All the variables except WOMEN had the qualitative effects predicted, 5
of the 10 independent variables affected the probability of adoption at statistically significant levels (P <

0.05), and the model correctly classified 80% of the
households (Table 4).
Using Eqs. (1) and (2), the calculated elasticities
of adoption were elastic for AGE and COSTKM and
inelastic for COCOA, the only policy variables whose
marginal effects were significantly different from zero
(Table 5).

4. Discussion of results
The positive effects of the number of men (MEN)
and the number of children (CHILD) suggests that

family labour is mobilised among adopters, although
the issue is not entirely clear for child labour. If
the decision-maker views children’s education as an
investment good, an increase in the number of children would increase the decision maker’s demand
for his/her children’s education which could provide an alternative to the labour demand hypothesis
for the positive coefficient on CHILD. Further investigation of intra-household revenue distribution,
labour allocation, and household expenditure is required to resolve this issue. The number of women
in the household (WOMEN) and the educational
attainment of the household head (EDUC) did not
influence the probability of adoption, although there
was a significantly greater educational attainment
(Student’s t = 2.59, P = 0.01) among adopters
(Table 3).
When women were the principal agent in management decisions (WPROD), there was a lower probability of adoption. Women’s wide range of responsibilities in village society limits their capacity for adopting
labour-intensive technology systems. In the few cases
where women were utilising monocrop systems they
were mainly producing traditional African leafy vegetables in the dry season when other labour demands
are reduced.
The negative effect of MELON, a proxy measure
of land availability, indicates that increasing land constraints positively influence the adoption of commercial horticultural production systems. This suggests
that, ceteris paribus, efforts to promote intensification
of horticulture production should target areas of relatively high population pressure.
The number of subsistence-oriented mixed food
crop fields, MFOOD, did not influence the adoption
of monocrop horticulture. Production from this field
system remains an important household objective for
both adopters and non-adopters alike. Many adopting households have included the monocrop field on
the front end of the mixed food crop/fallow rotation
thereby economising on labour for fallow clearing
while maintaining the subsistence contribution of the
mixed food crop field. The important cultural role attached to the cultivation of the mixed food crop field
by the women of southern Cameroon (Guyer, 1984)
and the limited access of most households to rural
food markets also contribute to its persistence among
adopting households.

J. Gockowski, M. Ndoumb´e / Agricultural Economics 30 (2004) 195–202

The cash requirements for intensive horticulture
production combined with the failure of formal rural
credit institutions present a constraint to adoption
especially for resource-poor households. Financial
demands of intensive production likely underlie the
positive effect of cocoa revenues (COCOA) on adoption. Mean cocoa sales among adopters during the
survey were more than double those of non-adopters;
the injection of cocoa revenues estimated at more
than 500 US$ into the household economy facilitated diversification into other enterprises. Similar effects between coffee and intensive horticulture have also been noted in the western region of
Cameroon (Temple and Fadani, 1997). This suggests that past policies in Cameroon supporting small
holder tree crop production had a positive impact on
the adoption of intensified commercial horticulture
production, although the effect is relatively inelastic
(Table 5).
The age of the household head was negatively associated with the probability of adoption. Younger farmers were more likely to adopt and the effect of age
on the probability of adoption was elastic (Table 5)
suggesting that policies, which impact demographics
and migration patterns would also affect the probability of adoption. Macroeconomic events beginning in
the late 1980s may have slowed rural–urban migration
and increased the cohort of young farmers in the rural
population (Gockowski and Ndoumbé, 1999).
The instrumental variable for rural road infrastructure and communications, COSTKM, also had significant and elastic effect on the probability of intensive
horticulture production. Elasticity at the sample mean
(maximum) is −1.12 (−2.59), which underscores the
importance of public investments in rural transportation infrastructure in the process of agricultural intensification.

5. Conclusions
Horticulture is providing a pathway for intensification among smallholders in southern Cameroon driven
by growth in urban market demand and high relative
prices. Its integration in the traditional farming system
enables the economical use of soil amendments that
provide a means for addressing the pressing issue of
soil nutrient depletion.

201

Demographic changes have played a major role in
the intensification of horticultural production. Rapid
rates of urbanisation, which in Cameroon averaged
over 7% in the 1970s and 1980s, have resulted in substantial demand growth in the urban markets of West
and central Africa. A slowing of rural-to-urban migration in the 1990s associated with macroeconomic
structural adjustments including the 1994 currency
devaluation appears to have increased the cohort of
younger farmers in the study area. Younger farmers were significantly more likely to adopt intensive
monocrop systems. This is an example of the important second-order effects of structural adjustments that
often escape the notice of policy makers.
Marketing costs have a significant and elastic effect on the adoption of intensive horticulture systems.
Greater public investment in rural roads and a downward adjustment of tariffs currently exceeding 100%
on new transport vehicles would help lower marketing costs. The diffusion of information on input and
crop prices, and quality differentials for these relatively volatile markets is another public intervention
which would lower market search costs and enhance
market efficiency. Local language radio broadcasts are
among the most cost-effective methods of information
provision (Robbins, 2000).
The combined influence of transport cost and increasing land scarcity on the adoption of intensified
production systems suggests targeting development efforts in areas of higher population densities with better
road infrastructure. For central Africa, rural areas in
the periphery of urban centres are the most likely domains for horticultural intensification, rather than the
hinterlands characterised by poorly developed transport infrastructure and sparse populations. Appropriate domains in west Africa are likely to be larger than
in central Africa due to higher overall population densities and better rural infrastructure.
The synergy between cocoa production and horticulture intensification suggests that promotion of
traditional export crops has contributed to the diversification of agricultural systems in the study area.
Whether similar processes of diversification and intensification have occurred among the cocoa and
coffee producers of Cote d’Ivoire, Nigeria and Ghana
warrants further study.
Women producers were not participating in intensive monocrop production. Efforts to address this

202

situation should consider the promotion of dry season
production of African traditional leafy vegetables,
when women’s labour demands are lower, and when
the price of these commodities rises two- to three-fold.
The importance of intensive horticultural production will continue to grow, especially if rapid urbanisation continues. As the conditions contributing to
intensification in southern Cameroon may not be the
same in other parts of West and central Africa, further
investigations of these processes across the region are
needed.
