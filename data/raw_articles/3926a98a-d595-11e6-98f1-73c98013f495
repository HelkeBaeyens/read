Abstract
A double hurdle model of off-farm work participation and off-farm labour income was derived and estimated consistent
with a farm household model. It was found that rationing and unexpected transaction costs inhibit farm households from
participating in off-farm work. The 1992 and the Agenda 2000 CAP reforms are most likely to increase the off-farm
employment of arable farm households, but its full effect cannot be realised because of inhibitions to enter off-farm activities.

1. Introduction

The 1992 European Union (EU) common agricultural policy (CAP) reform has changed the relative
role of price support and direct income support in
arable farming (Oude Lansink and Peerlings, 1996). It
reduced the price support for cereals and abolished the
deficiency payments for oilseeds. Instead compensatory acreage payments which act as direct income
support were introduced. A further reduction in price
support in combination with increased compensatory
acreage payments will take place in 2000 and 2001 as
a result of the decisions taken on Agenda 2000
(European Union, 1999).

These policy changes may affect the labour allocation offarmers between farm and off-farm activities. It
may also encourage farmers to diversify their income
sources (Hill, 1996). In a farm household, labour is
allocated between farm and off-farm work such that
the marginal value of farm labour equals the wage rate
of off-farm work (Becker, 1965; Gronau, 1973). Literature in off-farm work also indicates (see Hallberg et
al., 1991) that farm households' off-farm work decision is dependent on location, farm and non-farm
income, and family and financial characteristics (Lass
et al., 1991). It is inversely related to farm income
because of a substitution and income effect. Nonlabour incomes such as income from assets, social
security benefits, and direct income support reduce
off-farm employment due to an income effect only.
Consequently, a change in government policy due to
either a price policy or direct income support (e.g.

coming from the 1992 and Agenda 2000 CAP
reforms) may affect the desire of farm households
to participate in off-farm work.
However, in the presence of rationing and transaction costs in the labour market, the marginal value of
farm labour and the wage rate of off-farm work may
not be equal. In such cases, households cannot execute
their desired plan to work off their farm (Deaton and
Irish, 1984; Blundell and Meghir, 1987). Hence the
potential effect of the CAP reforms on off-farm work
may not be fully realised.
Capital and technology employed by a farm household, individual's age and education can have either a
negative or positive effect on the desire of farm households to parncipate in off-farm work as they affect
both farm and off-farm employment (Lass et al., 1991).
Moreover, the relative importance of these factors may
differ across households (Lass et al., 1991). Although
well documented for North America (see, for example, Hallberg et al., 1991), literature on off-farm work
is scarce for the Netherlands and Europe as a whole.
Furthermore, previous studies made on off-farm work
(Olfert, 1993; Kimhi, 1994, 1996; Hearn et al., 1996;
Kimhi and Lee, 1996; Mishra and Goodwin, 1997;
Tavernier et al., 1997; Weersink et al., 1998) do not
consider rationing in the off-farm labour market.
The objectives of this study are therefore (1) to
investigate the effect of farm and non-labour income
on the off-farm work decision and determine the implications of the 1992 and agenda 2000 CAP reforms; (2)
to investigate the role of other determinants of offfarm work; and (3) to test if Dutch arable farm households are actually inhibited by rationing and unexpected
transaction costs to enter off-farm activities.
Off-farm work participation and off-farm labour
income are modelled consistent with a farm household
model (Singh et al., 1986; Huffman, 1991). Moreover,
this paper uses a double hurdle model (Deaton and
Irish, 1984; Blundell and Meghir, 1987) and generalised Tobit model (Amemiya, 1984) in which the
participation decision and off-farm labour income
are jointly estimated using a maximum likelihood
estimator (MLE).
The rest of the paper is organised as follows. In the
next section, theory and model specifications are
discussed. In Section 3, the data and estimation methods are described. Section 4 discusses the results.
Section 5 presents the conclusions.

2. Theory and model specification
Off-farm employment of a farm household, using
off-farm labour income as a proxy, can be treated as a
latent variable, which may be observed when a household has a desire to participate in off-farm work and is
able to find a job in the labour market. In an agricultural household model an individual is willing to
participate in off-farm work when his reservation
wage Cwr;) is less than the off-farm wage Cwm;) net
of commuting and expected transaction costs.
The participation decision of a household to work
outside his farm (D;), can therefore be modelled as
follows:

Pr(D;= 1) = { Pr(U(n;(-),wm;,V;,Pc,a;) > 0)

(1)

where the probability of a farmer to participate in offfarm labour (Pr(-)) is assumed to depend on n(-) (farm
profit\ Wm; (the market wage rate), v (non-labour
income), Pc (price of consumption goods), and a;
(household characteristics); L 0 is off-farm labour ;
X is a column vector of variables that affect the
reservation and market wage; ex' is a row vector of
parameters; u; is the error term of the participation
decision. The latent variable off-farm labour income
(Y*) and observed off-farm labour income (Y) can be
specified as

1 Farm profit is included in both the participation equation (1)
and the off-farm labour income equation (2). The implicit
assumption that is made here is that both functions are separable
in all elements of n(-) (i.e. land, labour, capital and netput prices)
and Wmi• Pc and a,. The separability assumption that is made with
respect to labour is especially severe, since it is assumed that the
marginal rate of substitution of labour with capital and netput
prices is independent of the market wage rate.

2.1. Independent models
The ordinary Tobit model assumes that the same
stochastic process affects both the participation decision and off-farm labour income. A zero realisation for
a dependent variable represents a corner solution or a
negative value for the underlying latent dependent
variable (Cragg, 1971; Lin and Schmidt, 1984 ). When
a Tobit model is derived from the assumption that the
error term of the participation equation and the latent
variable are correlated, it is called generalised Tobit
model (Amemiya, 1984, pp. 29-33).
Even if farm households are willing to participate in
off-farm work, however, rationing in the labour market (Deaton and Irish, 1984; Blundell and Meghir,
1987) and unexpected transaction costs such as search
costs, information and other costs may inhibit them to
participate in off-farm work. In the presence of inhibition to join the off-farm activities, therefore, a doublehurdle model would be more appropriate than an
ordinary Tobit model (Cragg, 1971; Blundell and
Meghir, 1987, p. 197). The double hurdle model takes
into account that individuals have to pass two hurdles
to participate in off-farm work: they have to develop
the desire to participate in off-farm work and pass the
inhibition to join the labour market. If the correlation
between the error terms in the participation decision
and off-farm labour income is assumed to be zero,
then the model is called independent double hurdle
model or in short the model of Cragg (1971). In
contrast, if the independence assumption for the
error terms of the participation decision and off-farm
labour income is relaxed, it is called dependent double
hurdle model (Deaton and Irish, 1984; Blundell and
Meghir, 1987).
Following the lines of Maddala (1983), Amemiya
(Amemiya, 1984, p. 9) and Blundell and Meghir
(Blundell and Meghir, 1987, p. 181 ), the log likelihood
function of the Tobit model can be written as:

logL=

~ [-log CTe +log¢ (Y; ~:'X;)]

summation over observations with positive observed
off-farm labour income, and <D(-) and ¢0 refer to the
standard normal probability and density functions,
respectively.
In the independent double hurdle model, the probability that income (Y) is zero is the product of
probability that the latent variable off-farm labour
income (Y*) is negative and the probability that
Y* is positive. In this case, there is an inhibition to
carry out the desire to join the labour market.
Consequently, the log likelihood function for the
independent double hurdle model is given by
Blundell and Meghir (Blundell and Meghir, 1987,
p. 186):
logL=

;;=log[1-<D(p~~;)<D(a'X;)]
+

L

[-log CTe +log¢

+

(Y;-

P'X;)

CTe

+log<D(a'X;)l

(4)

When <D(a'X;) equals one, the independent double
hurdle model reduces to a standard Tobit model. Since
the Tobit model is nested into the independent double
hurdle model (Lin and Schmidt, 1984), a likelihood
ratio test can be used (Greene, 1993, p. 701) to
empirically test if farm households are actually inhibited to enter in the off-farm activities.

2.2. Dependent models
Relaxing the independence assumption, the two
error terms (u; and e;) are assumed to be joint normal
with variance-covariance matrix:
(5)

Then Eqs. (1) and (2) can be written as (Amemiya,
1984, pp. 31-32; Blundell and Meghir, 1987, p. 187),
respectively:

~log(1-<D(P~~;))
+

165

(3)

Yt =

P'X; + PCTeUi + e;,

Pr(D; = 1) = Pr(a'X; +
where the subscript 0 indicates summation over observations with zero off-farm labour income,+ indicates

u;

> 0).

(6)

It follows that the log likelihood of the generalised
Tobit can be rewritten as:

and 8 is an error term which is assumed to be normally

3. Data and estimation

y 1 - p-

When p is zero, it reduces to the model of Cragg
(1971), if <1>(1X1X) is one it reduces to a generalised
Tobit model (Amemiya, 1984), whereas, if p is zero
and <1>(1X1X) equals one, it reduces to a standard Tobit
model.
Explanatory variables (X's) were chosen to be
expected short-run farm profit, on-farm labour supplied by the head of the household and other family
members, land, capital, time, non-labour income such
as such as income from assets, social security benefits;
household characteristics such as age, education dummies, and family size, macroeconomics conditions
such as the consumer price index and average market
wage rates. All variables except expected short-run
farm profit are assumed to be exogenous. These variables affect both the reservation wage rate and the
market wage rate, and can be derived from an agricultural household model (Huffman, 1991).
Expected short-run farm profit has been derived
from a normalised quadratic profit function conditional on fixed inputs. It was assumed that output
prices were not known at the time decisions were
made on planting. Hence, expected rather than realised prices were used. Expected output prices were
constructed by applying an AR(l) filter to the price of
output. To impose linear homogeneity the profit function is normalised by the price of output (Thijssen,
1992, p. 31). The normalised quadratic short-run profit

Data on specialised arable farms, covering the
period 1971/72-1992/93, come from a stratified sample of farms keeping accounts on behalf of the LEIDLO farm accounting system2 . In total 912 individual
farms forming an unbalanced panel of 4110 observation were used for the analysis. Summary statistics of
the data used are given in Table 1. A more detailed
description of the sample used in this study can be
found in LEI-DLO (1992).
Family labour constitutes 88% of total labour used
on the farm, whereas hired labour makes up for the
remaining 12%. 37% of the observations reported no
use of hired labour at all. Out of the sample, 47% of the
farms have positive off-farm labour income. Furthermore, out of the 4110 observations, 65% ofthem have
medium and higher level agricultural education, 22%
of them have lower level agricultural education and
2.7% of them have general education.
Expected short-run farm profit was determined as
the expected price of output times output quantity
minus the value of variable inputs. There is one output
(composed of cereals, sugar beet, potatoes and other
outputs) and one variable input (fertiliser, seeds, pesticides, hired labour and other variable inputs). Tornqvist price indices (at 1980/81 prices) were calculated

for the compound variables (i.e. output and variable
inputs). Price indices vary over the years but not over
the farms, implying that the difference in the composition of the output/input or quality differences are
reflected in the quantity. Implicit input and output
quantity indices were obtained as the ratio of value and
the price indices. Therefore, quantities are measured at
constant 1980/81 prices. The market wage rate is the
wage rate of hired labour in arable farming and is
obtained from the LEI-DLO. Household budgets are
calculated using the sum of estimated farm profits and
non-labour income data from the LEI-DLO. All prices
and profit were normalised by the expected price of
output.
Labour is measured in hours worked on the farm
and is reported by the farmers in the LEI-DLO
accounting system; capital represents capital invested
in machinery and livestock and is measured at 1980/81
prices; land represents the cultivated area on the farm
and is measured in ares. Other variables included in
the profit function are a weather index to correct for
weather influences and a time trend to account for
technological change.
The expected short-run farm profit function is estimated using a random effects estimator after an OLS
estimator was rejected (see also Greene, 1993, pp.
479-480). A random effect estimator was also used for
the Tobit model of the off-farm labour income. The
panel data nature of the data used was not accounted

for in the estimation of the double hurdle model and
the generalised Tobit model of off-farm work participation and off-farm labour income; these were estimated using MLE.

4. Results
Parameter estimates of the profit function can be
found in Table 2. The estimated profit function (9) fits
the data well with an adjusted R 2 of 0. 70. Furthermore,
the profit function is monotonically increasing with
respect to the fixed inputs (labour, capital, land and
technology), decreasing and convex in the normalised
price of variable inputs.
First, a Tobit model (3) and Cragg model (4) were
estimated in order to test for inhibitions to participate
in off-farm activities (Table 3). The Tobit model is
rejected significantll implying that farm households
are inhibited to execute their desired plan to participate in off-farm activities. The computation of the
dependent double hurdle model (8) was, however,
found to be onerous and full convergence was not

possible to achieve (Results of the dependent double
hurdle model are not given in this paper). Next, the
generalised Tobit model (7) was estimated. The correlation coefficient (p) is not significantly different
from zero indicating that it is not worthwhile to use the
parameter estimates of the generalised Tobit model for
further analysis. Hence, the results of the independent
double hurdle model have been used for further analysis and interpretations. The results are summarised
in terms of quasi-elasticities4 (Cramer, 1991, p. 8) for
the probability of participating in off-farm work and
elasticities for the off-farm labour income (Table 4).
Expected short-run farm profit has a significant
negative impact on both the participation decision
and the level of off-farm labour income, but with
stronger impact on the level of off-farm labour income
than on the desire to participate. Non-labour income
did not show any significant effect on both the participation decision and off-farm labour income. An
increase in the output price by 1% increases expected

probability response quasi-elasticity is unit free.

short-run farm profit by 1.02% and the desire to
participate in off-farm work decreases by 0.06%,
and decreases the off-farm labour income by 0.99%
on the average. Hence the 1992 and Agenda 2000 CAP
reforms which decrease price support are most likely
to increase off-farm employment of farm households.
Family size, general education and age of the household head have a significant effect on the participation
decision, but an insignificant effect on the level of offfarm labour income. Family size increases the households' desire to participate in off-farm work, which is
consistent with the theory. Households with a larger
family size have relatively higher marginal utility of
income and a stronger desire to participate in off-farm
work. General education of the household head has a
little but positive significant effect on the participation
decision (Huffman, 1980). Agricultural education
does not show any significant effect on the off-farm
work decision at all. Age and age squared of the
household head show a significant quadratic age pattern on the participation decision which is consistent
with the life-cycle hypothesis (Sumner, 1982). On the
average, the desire of households to participate in offfarm work reaches its peak at the household head's age

170

of 41 years. This implies the prevalence of dual
employment among young farmers and full time farming among older farmers (Benjamin and Guyomard,
1994). However, neither age nor age squared showed
any significant effect on the level of off-farm labour
income.
When the on-farm labour supply of the household
head increases, both the desire to participate in offfarm work and the off-farm labour income decrease.
The direct effect of other family members' on-farm
labour supply is not significantly different from zero
in both the participation decision and the level of
off-farm labour income, but it has a little effect
indirectly through its effect on expected short-run
farm profit.
Farm characteristics such as land, capital and technology have a negative indirect impact on both the offfarm work participation decision and the level of offfarm labour income. Whereas the direct effects of
capital and technology are positive for off-farm labour
income, they are not significantly different from zero
for the participation decision. Consequently capital
and technology have a net negative effect on the
participation decision and a net positive effect on
the level of off-farm labour income. Land has a
significant positive direct effect and negative indirect
effect on the desire to participate in off-farm work.
The direct effect dominates the indirect effect and the
net effect turns out to be positive. But its direct effect
on the level of off-farm labour income is not significant and the net effect turns out to be negative. The
positive net effect of capital and technology on the
level of off-farm labour income may be due to the fact
that capital and technology employed by households
have a labour saving character. The net positive effect
of land on the off-farm work participation decision is a
strange result, which cannot be explained within the
framework of a neo-classical economic theory.
The consumer price index normalised by the price
of output shows a large and significant positive effect
on the level of off-farm labour income and a negative
but insignificant effect on the off-farm work participation decision. This illustrates that as the consumption
price increases the marginal utility of leisure decreases
and the intensity of off-farm work increases. The
average market wage rate, which is invariant across
households, does not show any significant effect on the
off-farm work decision.

5. Conclusions
The results confirm that farm households are inhibited by rationing and unexpected transaction costs
to participate in off-farm activities. Expected shortrun farm profit and on-farm labour supplied by a
household head have a strong negative impact on
the off-farm work decision of a household. Whereas,
non-labour income, on-farm labour supplied by other
family members and agricultural education do not
show any significant impact on the off-farm work
decision. Family size and general education show a
positive effect on the desire of households to participate in off-farm work, but not on the level of off-farm
labour income. Age of the household head shows
a significant quadratic pattern in the participation
decision only.
The policy implication is that government subsidies
aimed at increasing household's income through price
policies may have a negative impact on the off-farm
employment of farm households. Whereas, direct
income support does not create a disincentive for
households to participate in off-farm work. Hence,
the 1992 and Agenda 2000 CAP reforms, decreased
price support in combination with direct income support, are most likely to increase off-farm employment
of arable farm households in the Netherlands. However, in the presence of the inhibition to join off-farm
activities, the potential impact of the CAP-reforms
cannot be fully realised. The results also imply that
there is an alternative policy option for government
intervention if there is a need to make households
diversify the ways in which they gain their livelihood.
In the long run, the government can pursue policies such
as promoting education to enable farm households to
secure off-farm jobs more easily. In the short-run,
off-farm employment can be increased by reducing
inhibitions, such as farm households' access to various
information sources, to join off-farm activities.
