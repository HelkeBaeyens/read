ABSTRACT
Brandao, A. and Martin, W.J., 1993. Implications of agricultural trade liberalization for the
developing countries. Agric. Econ., 8: 313-343.
The developing countries as a group could expect to experience only small welfare gains
if they chose not to actively participate in agricultural trade liberalization and relied solely
on the benefits of partial liberalization in the OECD countries. Participation along the lines
of the Dunkel package, with the developing countries reducing positive assistance by less
than the developed countries, would yield gains of the order of US $20 billion. More
comprehensive participation in trade liberalization involving reductions of both positive and
negative protection would almost triple these welfare gains. While some developing countries do not gain from trade liberalization even with full participation, the number of such
countries and the magnitude of their losses are greatly reduced.

1. INTRODUCTION

The Uruguay Round has been the most complex of the eight rounds of
multilateral negotiations among the contracting parties to the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). With tariffs on most manufactured goods already reduced to low levels in developed countries, issues
put aside in earlier rounds have been brought to the forefront of the
discussions. Agriculture has assumed a key role in the process and the
conclusion of the round has been delayed several times primarily because
of difficulties in reaching an agreement on agriculture.

A. BRANDAO AND W.J. MARTIN

Substantial progress towards an agreement on agriculture has been
made. The U.S. and the Cairns group have drawn back from their initial
bold proposals for complete elimination of subsidies and the EC has
proposed to undertake significant reforms of its own agriculture (Andrews,
Roberts and Love, 1992). However, significant differences on the approach
to reform, on adjustment of border measures, domestic support and market
access, mainly (but not uniquely) between the U.S. and the EC positions,
required enormous negotiating effort.
The exclusion of agriculture from previous GATT rounds has meant that
national agricultural policies have been largely outside the disciplines
imposed on other. traded goods. The resulting situation has been aptly
described as one of 'disarray' in which a plethora of distortionary policies
have been applied: sometimes to raise domestic prices relative to world
prices; sometimes to lower domestic prices; and frequently to insulate
domestic prices from movements in world prices. Much of this intervention
has ultimately been self-defeating, with the combined effects of national
policies designed to raise and stabilize domestic prices being to depress and
destablize the world prices to which virtually all domestic prices are linked
in the long run (Mundlak and Larson, 1992). In developing countries, in
particular, the agricultural sector is also typically burdened with indirect
taxes imposed through protection to the manufacturing and services sectors. There is increasing awareness that the costs of policies in developing
countries are typically greater than they first appear (Krueger, Schiff and
Valdes, 1988, 1991).
Increasing awareness of the contradictory global effects of independent
national policies and of their full costs has contributed towards a desire for
reform of which the inclusion of agriculture in the Uruguay Round is one
manifestation. Another important type of reform has been occurring at the
national level, with many countries moving towards reform of their agricultural policies to reduce the budgetary or social costs. Some liberalization is
also occurring through the formation of regional trading blocs such as the
North American Free Trade Agreement. Another, more fundamental type
of reform is occurring in the formerly centrally planned economies whose
agricultural sectors are being radically restructured.
The Uruguay Round is the first in which the developing countries have
played an important role and a number of these countries have been
influential in the agricultural negotiations. Developing country food exporters have played an active role in the Cairns group supporting liberalization with a view to raising world prices of their exports. Food importers
have raised concerns about the likely impact of the policy reform on world
prices of agricultural commodities and about their capacity to bear a higher
import bill, although recent analysis suggests that, given the typical struc-

ture of developing country policies, many food importers are likely to gain
from multilateral trade reform (Loo and Tower, 1990; Anderson and Tyers,
1991).
How are the developing countries going to be affected by a liberalizing
outcome from the Uruguay Round and the unilateral agricultural policy
reforms occurring in parallel with the round? The answer to this question
depends heavily upon the type of policy reforms undertaken and on the
characteristics of these countries. As we shall see in this paper, the effects
on a particular country will depend heavily upon whether it participates in
the liberalization and hence reaps efficiency gains. In addition, it will
depend upon their trading position in the commodities affected: in general,
importers would be expected to benefit from reforms which lower the
prices of their imports, and exporters to gain from price rises, but this need
not always be the case in the real world situation where sizeable distortions
remain after a partial trade reform.
In this paper we review several quantitative assessments of the possible
implications of the Uruguay Round, focusing on the effects on developing
countries. This is done as follows: Section 2 provides some background for
the rest of the paper with a brief discussion of the agricultural policy
distortions whose liberalization is to be examined; Section 3 reviews the
results of previous studies which have examined the impact of agricultural
liberalization at a disaggregated level; Section 4 presents results of a partial
liberalization analysis using a world trade model, RUNS (Rural-Urban;
North-South), which has recently been updated in a joint research project
of the World Bank and the OECD Development Centre (Goldin, Knudsen
and van der Mensbrugghe, forthcoming). In Section 5 some concluding
remarks are offered.
2. PATTERN OF AGRICULTURAL PROTECTION

In the early stages of development, the relatively large share of agriculture in the economy and in exports and the relative ease of collection of
border taxes have predisposed governments to taxing agricultural exports.
The relatively high costs associated with effective political organization of
large numbers of producers in remote rural areas and the resulting political
weakness of the farm sector relative to urban interests have also greatly
strengthened this tendency. Many analysts now argue that developing
countries have frequently taxed agriculture beyond the level which achieves
the desired policy objectives. Untargeted subsidies to urban consumers
through price controls, overvalued exchange rates and mechanisms of
industrial assistance frequently also impose a serious burden on developing
country agriculture.

A. BRANDAO AND W.J. MARTIN

The World Bank undertook a major study of agricultural pricing policies
in place in 18 'representative' developing countries 1 during the period
1960-84 (Krueger, Schiff and Valdes, 1988, 1991). One of the objectives of
the study was to uncover the nature and extent of taxation of agriculture in
these countries. An important feature of the study is the use of a common
methodology which allows intercountry comparisons. Schiff and Valdes
(1992) have analyzed the broad characteristics of price interventions in the
18 countries. Some of their findings are summarized below:
(1) Most of the sample countries taxed the agricultural sector, with the
tax rate being highest in the poorest countries. The countries with the
highest level of per capita income, Korea and Portugal, protected agriculture during the period.
(2) The effects of indirect policy measures (exchange rate overvaluation
and industrial sector protection) were typically stronger than the effects of
direct policies for most countries. The average rate of direct agricultural
assistance was -7.9%, while the average total rate of assistance was
-30.3%.
(3) Direct policies tend to be used to protect importable commodities
even when these are staple foods. Exportables are frequently taxed. On
average, the rates of direct assistance for staples and importables were 6%
and 14%, respectively. The corresponding average total rates of protection
were -16.5% and - 8.6%, respectively. For exportables, direct (negative)
protection averaged -12.6% and total (negative) protection averaged
-34.6%. For all countries total protection for exportable commodities was
negative, though its level was very low for Portugal.
(4) Two of the three sub-Saharan countries included in the sample, Cote
d'Ivoire and Ghana, had positive total protection of staples and importables. The average for Sub-Saharan Africa was negative due to the extremely high taxes imposed in Zambia.
(5) Other countries that protected staples and importables, taking into
account direct and indirect policies, were Brazil, Korea, Malaysia, Portugal,
and Sri Lanka.
The protection database compiled for the RUNS project provides another, more recent, indication of agricultural protection levels in developing countries. This database was compiled largely on the basis of data on
agricultural trade distortions collected by the Economic Research Service

1 Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Cote d'Ivoire, Dominican Republic, Egypt, Ghana,
Korea, Malaysia, Morocco, Pakistan, Philippines, Portugal, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Turkey,
and Zambia.

(ERS) of the USDA 2 (see Webb, Lopez and Penn, 1990) supplemented,
where necessary, with estimates from the Krueger, Schiff and Valdes study.
The estimates used were averages for 1985 to 1987, a period for which a
reasonably wide coverage of countries is available. Regional averages were
formed from production weighted averages of the available national estimates. The estimated rates of assistance (expressed as a percentage of
undistorted values) were divided into two categories: the first being border
protection measures which introduce a distortion between internal prices
and world market prices; and the second being assistance provided directly
to producers.
A number of patterns are evident from the assembled data, shown in
Table 1:
(a) Upper-Income Asia protects the majority of agricultural commodities
heavily. This is consistent with the results of Krueger, Schiff and Valdes
and others who have noted the tendency for the higher income countries to protect agriculture.
(b) China taxed most agricultural commodities heavily in the sample period.
(c) Rice and. sugar are typically protected with China being an important
exception in the case of rice.
(d) Coarse grains are also typically protected. Exceptions were China,
Mrica and India.
(e) Nigeria, an oil exporter, protected most commodities. However, it taxed
cocoa, a nonfood exportable.
(f) In the other regions, a mixed pattern of taxation and protection is
evident.
While these results confirm some of the findings of Krueger, Schiff and
Valdes, they also highlight the fact that the pattern of protection in the
developing countries is quite diverse. Taxation of agriculture continues to
be an important component of the policies adopted in these regions, but
protection, sometimes at high rates, is observed for a number of commodities and regions.
Estimates of the assistance (taken from OECD, 1991) provided to their
agricultural sectors by the OECD countries are presented in Table 2. By
contrast with the developing countries, direct assistance to agriculture was
always positive for both border protection measures and domestic subsidies. Commodities such as dairy products and sugar were heavily supported

We are grateful to Carlos Mabbs-Zeno and Renata Penn of the ERS for supplying as yet
unpublished estimates prepared after publication of the Webb, Lopez and Penn (1990)

a Total agricultural protection is divided into two components, both expressed as a proportion of the gross value of output: (1) Border
protection measures the effects of distortions which change the relationship between domestic and world prices (e.g. tariffs, import
quotas). (2) Domestic support measures the effects of policies which affect the profitability of production without directly affecting
consumer protection (e.g. subsidies to producers).

high in 1a pan, the EC and EFTA, but low in the more land-abundant
regions (the USA, Canada and Australia/New Zealand).
Since the RUNS model is fully general equilibrium in scope, it can take
into account the effects of agricultural protection/taxation in the context
of distortions in other traded goods markets. Estimates of average protection rates in each RUNS region to four aggregate non-agricultural commodities (energy, fertilizer, machinery and other manufactures) were compiled by Roland-Holst (1991) and are reported in Table 3. From these
estimates, it is clear that rates of protection to the manufacturing sector in
developing countries were typically positive and higher than the rates of
assistance to agriculture. By contrast, manufacturing sector protection was
much lower than assistance to agriculture in the developed country regions.
3. RECENT STUDIES OF THE IMPACT OF AGRICULTURAL LIBERALIZATION

Perhaps fortunately, the commencement of the Uruguay Round closely
followed the development of large scale agricultural trade models able to
provide answers to the fundamental questions arising in the implementation of global agricultural trade liberalization. The models allow the
instruments manipulated by policy makers such as tariffs and quotas to be
linked to ultimate objectives of trade liberalization such as national welfare
and distribution, thus avoiding the need to focus exclusively on proximate
targets such as trade creation 3 whose implications may be very misleading.
The attention given to agricultural trade liberalization in the round greatly
stimulated the development of trade models during the 1980s. The model
results, and the insights generated, were made widely available and appear
to have influenced the positions of many of the negotiators.
Global agricultural modeling is a complex balancing effort, with a
difficult balance to be drawn between capturing the central features of the
issue and retaining a workable model. The agricultural sector is extremely
diverse, with multiple outputs from a common resource base being the
norm; and with the agricultural resources of countries being strongly
differentiated, requiring the inclusion of a relatively wide range of commodities. Vertical market linkages, particularly for feed grains, introduce
further complexities. In addition, the long absence of agriculture from
GATT disciplines has contributed to the plethora of domestic and trade
3 Rules of thumb based on estimates of trade creation such as that suggested in The
Economist (1992, p. 55), " ... for countries previously separated by quite high trade barriers,
the gain in welfare due to trade liberalization equals about one fifth of the expansion of
trade" cannot be expected to give reliable results in a multilateral context.

policy instruments, many of which are non-transparent and difficult to
model.
Without full trade liberalization being a possibility, the negotiations have
remained in the notoriously difficult domain of second best welfare evaluation where nothing is known in general about the welfare consequences of
a single liberalization. Only if a model is carefully specified to deal with
this problem can definitive welfare conclusions be obtained. Second best
approaches to welfare evaluation are likely to be important within agriculture, where there is generally considerable diversity between commodities
in levels of assistance and also between agriculture and the remainder of
the economy. The importance of this point was highlighted by the striking
findings of Loo and Tower (1990) that net food importers could, under
realistic circumstances, .gain from higher world prices.
In most models, productivity growth has been viewed as exogenously
determined. In the spirit of modern endogenous growth theory, however,
some of the more recent studies of agricultural trade liberalization (e.g.,
Anderson and Tyers, 1990; Brandao, Tsigas, van der Mensbrugghe and
Goldin, 1992) have incorporated an endogenous, positive response of
research and development and hence technology to the level of producer
prices. With liberalization in the developed countries, producer prices tend
to fall in the developed countries and to rise in the developing countries, so
that technical progress accelerates in the developing world relative to the
developed countries.
Model results

While the ultimate objective of trade liberalization policies must be to
enhance welfare, much of the modeling work has focussed upon an
intermediate effect: the impact of liberalization on world prices of agricultural commodities. Most studies, except the pioneering model by Valdes
and Zietz (1980), have explicitly incorporated a full set of own-and crossprice effects and there has been a tendency for the elasticities used to
converge over time, particularly once extensive compendia of agricultural
elasticities became available (Sullivan, Wainio and Roningen, 1989). There
has also been a marked tendency towards convergence in the estimates of
the magnitude of the policy-induced distortions, with heavy reliance placed
on the estimates collected by the OECD for developed countries and the
USDA (ERS) for developing countries.
Comparable estimates of the effects of trade liberalization on agricultural prices have been produced by several studies. Most of the models
have been used to provide indications of the consequences of trade
liberalization in developed countries. A summary of the estimated impacts

on world prices of major commodities from these studies is given in
Table 4.
While there is considerable variation in the results presented in Table 4,
there are also some consistent patterns. With agricultural protection eliminated, supply from the developed countries falls and the world prices of
most commodities are, in most cases, predicted to rise. The prices of the
relatively heavily protected dairy, sugar and meat commodities are generally estimated to rise by more than other commodities. Wheat prices are
generally expected to rise substantially, reflecting the removal of the high
average rates of protection in the developed countries. There is, however,
an important caveat on this last-mentioned result, associated with the
generally crude treatment of agricultural protection in the models: once the
effects of supply-reducing features of current policies are considered,
output in the United States and in some other developed country suppliers
may increase and prices could fall (Whalley and Wigle, 1990). For virtually
all of the studies, the price of rice is expected to rise by less than the price
of all of the other grains. This result reflects the relatively minor importance of the developed countries as a group in the world rice market.
Although there are exceptions to the rule, there is a tendency for the
price rises estimated by the three models listed at the bottom of the table,
the general equilibrium models, to be somewhat less than the estimates
obtained from the partial equilibrium models. This result likely reflects the
greater substitution possibilities in the general equilibrium models, where
the flow of resources between sectors is explicitly incorporated.
Much less evidence is available on the consequences of liberalization
involving both the developed and developing countries since most modeling

efforts have focussed on OECD policy liberalization alone. The set of
available estimates of the effects of simultaneous liberalization in both
developed and developing country markets is presented in Table 5.
The estimates presented in Table 5 involve the removal of the frequently
positive protection in developed countries and the frequently negative
protection in the developing countries. The estimates thus refer to a
broad-based move to liberalization of all agricultural trade distortions,
including negative producer distortions whose removal is unlikely to be
required by a GATT agreement. The effect on rice is very clearly reversed
relative to the OECD liberalization case, with the negative protection in
the developing world outweighing the positive effect from the developed
countries. The positive effects on wheat prices are reduced or reversed in
most cases. However, the picture is less clear cut for dairy products and
meat where many developing countries provide positive assistance. The
estimates of the consequences of including developing country liberalization are far more diverse than the estimates for developed country liberalization alone, in part because of the poor quality of the estimates of
developing country policy distortions available to these studies and in part
because of the frequently offsetting nature of the distortions in developed
and developing economies.
The available evidence on the effects of liberalization on welfare in the
developing countries is even more limited and diverse than the evidence on
world prices. Most early research tended to focus on the temperate
agricultural products primarily exported by the developed countries and
concluded that developing countries, as net importers of these products,
would lose from liberalization-induced price increases. Once developing

Notes: The commodity coverage of the Krissoff et al. study is slightly broader than for
Anderson and Tyers (1991) because Anderson and Tyers consider only temperate products:
wheat, coarse grain, rice, ruminant meat, nonruminant meat dairy products and sugar.
Krissoff et al. also include oilseeds, cotton and tobacco. Neither study considers the tropical
beverages of prime importance to many developing countries. The Krissoff et al. study
measures welfare changes by combining impacts on producer surplus, Marshallian consumer
surplus and direct government revenues relative to a 1986 baseline. Anderson and Tyers
measure welfare changes in 1985 dollars using producer surplus, Hicksian consumer surplus
and direct impacts on government revenues.

country liberalization is included, this linkage becomes somewhat less
consistent, with world prices of commodities produced subject to negative
assistance in developing countries falling, and with the developing countries themselves experiencing efficiency gains as a consequence of the
removal of their own policy distortions. The results obtained also depend
heavily upon whether allowance is made for endogenous productivity
growth.
Reasonably comparable results for the welfare consequences of complete trade liberalization are available from a recent study by Anderson
and Tyers (1991, p. 26) and a USDA study by Krissoff, Sullivan, Wainio
and Johnston (1990, pp. 45-46). The USDA study is 'conventional' in not
including any feedback from price changes to productivity growth. The
Anderson and Tyers study, by contrast, incorporates feedback from price
changes to technological advance. The results obtained in both studies
include those from an experiment in which only the industrialized
economies liberalize and results when all economies participate in the
liberalization.
When the developed countries alone liberalize, the Krissoff et al. (1990)
results (presented in Table 6) point to losses for most developing countries,
although these are small relative to developing country GDP. However,
when the developing countries participate in the liberalization process, the
picture changes considerably as they benefit from reductions in deadweight
losses and, in some cases, from terms of trade changes. With global
liberalization, most of the economies of Asia and Latin America are
projected to experience gains. In Africa, the food importing countries of
North Africa and the Middle East experience losses while Sub-Saharan
Africa as a whole experiences a small welfare gain. The former Soviet
Union is projected to experience a substantial welfare loss because of
increases in the price of imported food.
In the Anderson and Tyers results (1991), the developing countries in
aggregate gain, even in the case where only the OECD countries liberalize.
However, the gain to the developing countries is much larger when they
participate in the liberalization: in this case, the welfare gain more than
doubles- from US $16.6 billion to US $33.4 billion. In the case where only
the industrial countries liberalize, the developing countries which lose are
primarily heavy food importers such as the North African oil exporters,
Taiwan (China) and Bangladesh. When the distortionary effects of policies
in the developing economies are removed in the second experiment, only a
very few developing economies continue to experience losses and these are
relatively minor. From a comparison with the Krissoff et al. results, and
with earlier results with the Tyers-Anderson model, it appears that the
inclusion of endogenous technical change has major implications for the
results.

328

A. BRANDAO AND W.J. MARTIN

The focus of most of the literature has been on the implications of
complete liberalization despite the fact that complete trade liberalization
will clearly not occur as a result of the Uruguay Round. Recent studies by
Loo and Tower (1990), Tyers and Falvey (1989) and by Martin, Knudsen,
Tsigas and van der Mensbrugghe (1991) make it clear that the consequences of partial liberalization cannot be assumed to be a simple fraction
of the consequences of total liberalization. Loo and Tower (1990) demonstrate that apparently paradoxical results, such as food importers gaining
from increases in the price of food, are feasible.
The analysis undertaken for this paper differs from the earlier studies in
dealing specifically with several types of partial liberalization in order to
capture the potentially important welfare consequences of this liberalization. It focusses on agricultural liberalization, rather than the overall
liberalization of trade policies considered by Goldin and van der Mensbrugghe (1992), but utilizes the full general equilibrium framework provided by the RUNS model to capture the full set of interactions between
commodities. The analysis in this paper is also tailored more specifically to
the specific features of the Dunkel liberalization package than are the
earlier studies.
4. IMPLICATIONS OF AGRICULTURAL LIBERALIZATION FOR THE
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES: RESULTS FROM THE RUNS MODEL

The RUNS model was originally developed by Jean-Marc Burniaux and
Jean Waelbroeck. The current version of RUNS is described in Goldin,
Knudsen and van der Mensbrugghe (forthcoming) and documented comprehensively in Burniaux and van der Mensbrugghe (1991) 4 .
The model contains the 22 regions described in the footnote to Table 1.
There are two agricultural sectors in each region: crops and livestock. The
crops sector produces eleven commodities and the livestock sector four.
Five manufacturing goods are produced by single output sectors.
There is perfect substitution between domestic and traded agricultural
commodities. For manufactures, however, goods are differentiated according to region of origin using the Armington specification (with a CES
function for imports and a CET function for exports).
There are four primary factors: capital, labor, land and draught cattle.
Investment is driven by savings. The capital stock in the manufacturing
sector is fully mobile across commodities. In the rural sectors, capital and
The following description of the model draws heavily on Burniaux and van der Mensbrugghe (1991).

4

AGRICULTURAL TRADE LIBERALIZATION IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES

329

dry land are aggregated into a composite factor and labor, draught cattle,
and irrigated land are combined in another composite factor. Rural investment is determined by the relative profitability of the various assets: dry
land, irrigated land, tractors and draught cattle.
A labor migration equation, driven by the difference between urban and
rural per-capita incomes, together with population growth, determines the
allocation of labor between the rural and urban sectors. In the version of
the model used here, a flexible wage rate maintains constant employment
of labor.
Land is modeled considering both an estimated upper bound on availability and actual demand. As actual demand gets closer to the maximum
availability, the marginal cost of land use increases.
The specification of demands for current consumption goods and for
saving is based on the Extended Linear Expenditure System for both the
urban and the rural households. Rural disposable incomes consist of net
(of factor taxes) returns to factors, the rural sector's share of the net
government revenue generated by price distortions and the value added
tax, and a part of the costs of stock operations. 5 Urban disposable incomes
consist of net (of factor taxes) returns to factors and the residual of net
government revenue from market distortions, the value added tax, and
stock operations.
Government expenditures are assumed to grow at the same rate as GDP.
Government revenues are obtained from trade taxes on agricultural and
non-agricultural commodities, from a tax on value added and from agricultural stockholding operations. In the closure used in this analysis tax rates
were exogenous, making government savings (the budget surplusjdeficit)
endogenous.
The model was closed with the assumption of an exogenous balance of
trade constraint or, equivalently, supply of foreign savings to the economy.
With domestic private and government consumption and savings decisions
explicitly modeled, investment spending was determined by the availability
of savings. The model was calibrated with data for 1985 and is solved until
the year 2002 in three-year increments.
The data base includes estimates of price distortions on agricultural and
non-agricultural goods. The agricultural price distortions in OECD countries were obtained from OECD (1991) estimates for the years 1986, 1987,
1988 and 1990, straddling the base periods used in the current proposals
for trade reform. As discussed above, estimates of agricultural distortions

shares are used to allocate tax and stockholding revenues to each sector.

330

in the developing countries in the 1985-87 period were constructed using
USDA (ERS) and World Bank data.
The agricultural policy instruments in RUNS consist of ad valorem
wedges for divergences between domestic and world prices, and for divergences between the prices received by producers and paid by consumers.
The first measure is expressed as a fixed tariff equivalent while the second
is interpreted as a producer subsidy equivalent incorporating all assistance
paid directly to producers without directly affecting the market price. The
results presented below deal with the long run response to liberalization
and hence full price transmission between world and domestic prices is
assumed.
Since the specification of the model is based strongly on economic
theory, it is possible to relate the model results to the underlying expenditure and revenue functions, and hence to measure welfare changes using a
modification of the Trade Expenditure Function approach (Anderson and
Neary, 1992; Martin, 1992). The approach measures the effects of changes
in all variables on the cost of achieving a given level of utility, less any
effects on revenues from production and taxation. As demonstrated by
Martin et al. (1991), this approach has the advantage of allowing consistent
measures of the welfare consequences of policy changes in the presence of
multiple distortions.

Model results
From a trade liberalization perspective, the best outcome now likely to
be achieved under the Uruguay Round is an agreement along the lines of
the Dunkel (GATT, 1991) proposal. Key features of this proposal for
agricultural policy reform under the GATT are:
- Tariffication of import barriers and their reduction by an average of
36% from their 1986-88 average tariff equivalents.
- Reduction of 36% in budget outlays on export subsidies from a 19861989 base and a reduction of 24% in the volume of subsidized exports.
- Reduction of 20% in aggregate measure of domestic support (AMS)
relative to a fixed 1986-88 average external reference price.
The reduction requirements apply to positive protection, and imply no
requirement to reduce export taxes or import subsidies. Further, developing country members of GATT are allowed special and differential provisions which require reductions only two thirds the size of those required of
developed countries, and least developed countries are exempted from
reduction commitments.
Some simplification is required if the broad features of a likely global
agreement are to be captured. Tariffication of import barriers and their

AGRICULTURAL TRADE LIBERALIZATION IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES

331

reduction by 36% is readily captured in the modeling framework used in
this study. However, a 36% reduction in the value of export subsidies by a
single country would typically require less than a 36% reduction in the ad
valorem equivalent of such an export subsidy since the value reduction
would result from changes in both the rate of assistance and in the quantity
exported. In a multilateral context, reductions in export subsidies are likely
to raise world prices, offsetting the reduction in export volumes implied by
declines in export subsidies. Thus, treating reductions in export subsidies as
a 36% reduction in export subsidy rates seems likely to provide a reasonable approximation to the effects of the proposal.
The limitation on the volume of subsidized exports that is also part of
the proposal was not considered in the experiment. Either the price
instrument or the quantity constraint, but not both, can be effective and, in
a growing world economy, the price instrument is more likely to be
effective in the long run.
The actual requirement imposed on domestic subsidies by the Dunkel
proposal is specified through a 20% reduction in the value of an Aggregate
Measure of Support (AMS), including both domestic subsidies and border
measures. Since the support provided by border measures is to be reduced
by more than 20%, the required reduction in purely domestic support
measures may initially be less than the 20%. However, the use of a fixed
reference price will raise the calculated AMS if world prices of commodities rise following liberalization and place a counteracting downward pressure on domestic assistance. Over time, further downward pressure may be
placed on domestic assistance levels by erosion of the real value of the
fixed Aggregate Measure of Support. On balance, specifying a reduction of
20% in the rate of assistance provided by domestic supports seems likely to
provide a reasonable representation of the effects of the proposal.
Four broad liberalization scenarios are considered: the implementation
of the Dunkel package in the developed country; a similar reduction in all
protection (positive and negative) in developed and developing countries; a
package like the complete Dunkel proposal, with smaller protection reductions in the developing countries, and a further experiment under which
only the developing countries liberalize by the same amount as the developed countries in the other simulations.
All results shown below are for the year 2002, and so incorporate most
of the long run supply and demand adjustments that will follow the
liberalization process. Due to space limitations, only two sets of results are
discussed below: the impact on world prices (expressed relative to the
model's numeraire, the average price of OECD exports of manufactures)
and on welfare.

World Prices. The first two columns of Table 7 display the impacts on
world prices of Dunkel type partial liberalization by the OECD countries
alone. In the first column, it is assumed that the U.S. land set aside policy
is unchanged following liberalization. Dairy, sugar, beef and wheat are the
commodities for which the largest price increases are observed, reflecting
the high levels of protection in the OECD countries. All other price
increases are smaller than 3%. The prices of coffee and cocoa, crops not
directly affected by the policy change, are only marginally affected. Tea,
another crop not directly affected by the price change, experiences a
somewhat larger price increase. This is likely due to the fact that developing countries that are important producers of tea will move away from the
crop into wheat, sugar, coarse grains and livestock.
The estimated effects on world prices obtained from this simulation
appear broadly in line with the results obtained in the earlier studies
reported in Table 4 when allowance is made for the fact that we have
considered only partial agricultural liberalization of the type likely to result
from the Uruguay Round while the earlier studies considered full liberal-

ization. Given this difference, we might expect our results to be in the
order of a third to a quarter of the magnitude of those observed in the
earlier studies. When scaled up to reflect this, our result for wheat is of the
same order of magnitude as most of the results in Table 4. Rice, similarly,
falls well within the range observed in the earlier studies, as do the results
for meat. Our dairy result is consistent with the OECD jMTM model
results and the IIASA results but well below the estimates reported by
Anderson and Tyers (1990) and by the USDAjSWOPSIM model. The
sugar result is much closer to the results reported for other models than for
the earlier version of the RUNS model.
Commodity policy in the United States contains two broad types of
instruments: price support payments which tend to increase the level of
output; and land set aside requirements which tend to reduce the level of
output. While the exact link between the two instruments is difficult to
specify, higher levels of price support increase the ability of policy makers
to induce farmers to withdraw land from production and, by placing
downward pressure on world prices, require reductions in U.S. production.
The use of producer subsidy equivalents ignores the effects of set aside
requirements. To assess the sensitivity of the model results to changes in
this parameter, set aside ratios for the major field crops in the United
States (wheat, coarse grains, cotton and rice 6 ) are relaxed by 20% from
their average values over the period 1985 to 1991, in line with the reduction
in domestic support levels. In this experiment, world prices increase slightly
less than before, except for oils. Clearly, the reduction in the set aside
requirements for competing crops, such as corn, draws land away from
soybeans, thus reducing the world supply of oilseeds.
In the next two columns of Table 7, all protection rates in the developed
and developing countries are reduced to the same extent as in the first
column. This scenario clearly goes beyond the liberalization specified by
the Dunkel proposal in requiring reductions in negative as well as positive
assistance and is intended to explore the consequences of GATT liberalization complemented by a corresponding wave of liberalization undertaken
either unilaterally or through regional arrangements.
As noted previously, due to the fact that some commodities such as dairy
products and sugar are protected in most developing countries (and in the

6 The average set aside requirements as a percent of planted area used were 26.1% for
wheat, 17.4% for coarse grain, 44.8% for rice, and 26.7% for cotton. Estimates of the supply
impact of smaller set aside acreage are based on Love and Foster (1990). Soybean yields are
adjusted to take into account the fact that some of the land coming out of set asides will be
used for soybeans, without changes in total soybean acreage.

former socialist countries of Eastern Europe and the CIS), the price rises
following global liberalization are frequently larger than when only the
industrial countries liberalize. However, except for wool, livestock products
experience smaller price increases with global liberalization. This is also
the case for coffee and cocoa which are typically taxed in the producing
countries. An interesting case is rice. It is protected in most countries but
heavily taxed in China. The supply response there is strong enough to
reverse the sign of the price change in relation to the OECD liberalization
experiment. The relaxation of the U.S. set asides leads only to marginal
modifications in the results, as noted in the discussion of OECD liberalization.
The next column, following more closely the spirit of the Dunkel
proposal (detailed above), shows the price changes implied by the same
reduction in positive protection in the OECD countries and a reduction in
the non-OECD countries of two-thirds of that made in the OECD countries (no changes in the U.S. set asides). Typically, price changes in this
scenario are higher than under OECD liberalization because only positive
protection in the non-OECD regions is reduced. The price changes also
tend to be larger than under the GLOBAL liberalization where all distortions (positive or negative) are reduced, because removing negative protection stimulates supply and depresses world prices. Because the reduction in
protection in non OECD countries is lower in this experiment than in
GLOBAL (only two-thirds of the cuts in GLOBAL), the price changes are
lower than under GLOBAL for some commodities, such as sugar, where
protection is ubiquitous.
The last column of Table 7 displays the consequences of partial liberalization along the lines of the OECD and GLOBAL experiments undertaken by the developing countries only. This experiment is not directly
related to the Uruguay Round, but will be useful to indicate the welfare
implications of various kinds of policy reforms. As expected, the impacts on
world prices are relatively small. There are exceptions, of course, which are
due to the large share of these countries in production and trade of
commodities such as cocoa and coffee.
Table 8 displays the impacts on world prices of the same policy experiments presented in Table 7 with endogenous response of productivity to
prices incorporated in the analysis. Most of the elasticities of productivity
to price changes are taken from Fulginiti and Perrin (1993). A complete list
of all the elasticities is given in Brandao, Tsigas, van der Mensbrugghe and
Goldin (1992) and a conceptual description of the experiment is in the
Technical Appendix to that paper. As in Table 7, the first two columns of
the table contain the results of liberalization only in the OECD countries.
In this experiment, the typical response in the OECD countries is a

slowdown in the rate of productivity increase in response to lower producer
prices. The opposite typically takes place in the non-OECD countries.
Therefore, whether the price changes are larger or smaller than in the
previous experiment depends on the share of production in these two
regions. As can be seen from comparing the first columns of Tables 7 and
8, the majority of prices increase slightly more with endogenous technical
change considered. Similarly, with liberalization in all countries (GLOBAL
liberalization) and with the Dunkel liberalization scenario, the world price
changes are not very far apart in the scenarios with and without induced
response of productivity. It should be noted that in the Dunkel experiment,
the balance between the slowdown in productivity growth in countries with
positive protection and the acceleration of productivity growth in the other
countries determines whether the price increases in Table 8 are bigger or
smaller than the corresponding ones in Table 7. For all but one commodity,
the results are similar to those observed for the OECD experiment, i.e.,
either the price increase in Table 8 is larger than the corresponding price
increase in Table 7 in the two experiments or the price increase is smaller

in both. The exception is wheat, where in the Dunkel experiment the price
increase is somewhat smaller with endogenous productivity change and the
opposite is true in the OECD experiment.
Welfare effects. The welfare effects of trade liberalization arise from three
components: efficiency gains from liberalization; terms of trade impacts,
and second-best welfare effects manifested in induced changes in tariff
revenues. Table 9 displays the welfare impacts of liberalization, without
endogenous productivity growth, in the OECD countries, in all countries
(GLOBAL), in all countries that subsidize agricultural commodities
(Dunkel), and in the developing countries 7 . The first two columns show,
for the OECD liberalization, the welfare gain (loss) in dollars and as a
percentage of GDP for each one of the 22 regions of RUNS. A number of
developing countries are hurt but, taken as a group, they experience a
(small) gain of US $629 million. This result lies between the loss of $5
billion estimated by Krissoff et al. (1990) (see Table 6) and the gain of $16.6
billion estimated by Anderson and Tyers (1991) for full liberalization and
so does not seem to be out of the range implied by the earlier literature.
The net gain of the developing countries in this experiment can be
attributed largely to terms of trade effects, with exporters gaining from
world price rises and importers tending to lose. The largest gainers from
industrial country liberalization are Brazil, other Latin America, and India.
As usual in this kind of analysis, the gains and losses for each region tend
to be a small percentage of GDP. With the Dunkel experiment, however,
there is a marked increase not only in the total gains for developing
countries, which are now US $20 billion, but also in the gains to individual
regions. The most spectacular change is in Upper-Income Asia which
under the Dunkel experiment gains about half of the total gain for the
developing countries while it lost from OECD liberalization. Although this
region is a net importer of agricultural goods, it appears that the efficiency
gains from liberalization are large enough to compensate for the negative
terms of trade effect. A similar analysis applies to the oil exporting
countries. While Other Latin American (LAT) countries (excluding Mexico) gain in the OECD liberalization, this gain is almost doubled under the
Dunkel experiment and the additional gain for Brazil is about 29%. Mexico
experiences an extremely large welfare gain in this scenario, very likely due
to the efficiency gains associated with the reduction in the protection rate
for corn and wheat.

In view of the small impact of the release of U.S. set asides on world market outcomes,
these results are not presented in order to save space.

A. BRANDAO AND W.J. MARTIN

When liberalization in all countries (GLOBAL) is considered, the gains
for the developing countries as a whole tend to increase substantially in
relation to the OECD and the Dunkel experiments, with few exceptions. It
is worth noting the case of sub-Saharan Africa which, even in this scenario,
does not gain from the policy change, even though its losses are reduced in
relation to the other two scenarios. The developing countries as a group
gain about US $59 billion in this scenario. This estimate of the gains to
developing countries is much larger than the estimate of US $2 billion
reported by Krissoff et al. (1990) and larger than the US $33.4 billion
reported by Anderson and Tyers, even though these results refer only to
partial liberalization and do not incorporate linkages through induced
productivity changes. As would be expected, the result reported in this
paper is smaller than the $90 billion estimated by Goldin and van der
Mensbrugghe (1992) who considered a liberalization in which domestic
support measures were reduced by a larger proportion.
One major influence on the difference between the RUNS results and
those obtained from the partial equilibrium model results of Anderson and
Tyers (1991) and Krissoff et al. (1990) is likely to be the general equilibrium
nature of the RUNS model, with resources able to flow between agriculture and other sectors. A second influence is the much wider commodity
coverage of our analysis, which includes tropical crops, oilseeds, cotton and
tobacco, all of which are excluded from the Anderson and Tyers (1991)
study. Another is the approach to modeling welfare changes used in this
study, which captures the effects on welfare resulting from changes in
government revenues induced by the liberalization. We consider reductions
in assistance which are less than a third of the full liberalization reductions
in assistance undertaken by Krissoff et al. and Anderson and Tyers (1991).
An important feature of the gains from partial trade liberalization is their
front end loaded nature, with greater gains from the initial stages of
liberalization than from subsequent stages (Martin et al., 1991), so that our
results should be more than one-third of the gains from full liberalization.
These experiments indicate that the bulk of the gains for the developing
countries would come from reforming their own policies, including positive
and negative protection. Even countries that gain in the OECD scenario,
such as Mexico, experience a substantially higher gain from unilateral
reform. The results of the fourth scenario shown in Table 9, liberalization
by the developing countries only, is intended to make this fact explicit.
Notice, for example, that about 60% of the gain of Low Income Asia under
GLOBAL liberalization would be obtained under DEVELOPING COUNTRY liberalization alone. Even though the African region loses from
GLOBAL liberalization, it would gain under DEVELOPING COUNTRY
liberalization alone. The total gain for the developing countries under

DEVELOPING COUNTRY liberalization is of the order of US $56
billion, that is about 95% of the gain under GLOBAL liberalization.
Even though the gains for the developing countries in the Dunkel
experiment are only about one-third of those in GLOBAL, they are high in
comparison to the OECD only experiment. This reinforces the important
point that full participation in the GATT process is strongly in the interest
of most developing countries.
The set of results displayed in Table 10 reflects the inclusion of endogenous productivity change. The gains for the developing countries tend to be
larger while those for the OECD countries tend to be smaller than in the
absence of productivity change (see Table 9 for comparison). As a group,
the OECD countries gain about US $73 billion dollars under OECD
liberalization; taking endogenous productivity growth into account this
drops to approximately US $71 billion. The corresponding figures for
GLOBAL liberalization are US $73 billion and US $65 billion. With
liberalization in the OECD, the developing countries as a group increase
their overall gain from US $629 million without productivity endogenous to
about US $30 billion with endogenous productivity. The estimates are US
$60 and US $131 billion, respectively, for global liberalization, US $19 and
US $44 billion for the Dunkel package, and US $56 and US $98 billion,
respectively, for liberalization only by the developing countries.
5. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

This paper is essentially comprised of two parts. In the first, the
structure of agricultural protection in developing and developed countries
is outlined and the literature on estimating the implications of trade
liberalization is reviewed. The second part utilizes a recently revised
version of the RUNS model to analyze the consequences of agricultural
trade liberalization.
The first experiment reported estimated the consequences of implementing the Dunkel proposal in the OECD countries only. A second experiment
includes a comparable reduction in all assistance (including both positive
and negative protection) in all countries (GLOBAL). A third experiment
examines the implications of an experiment closer to the actual Dunkel
proposal: a reduction of distortions applied to agriculture by the OECD
countries and a reduction of positive protection in the developing countries
in the order of two-thirds of that in the OECD. A final experiment
considers a reduction of all protection (negative and positive) rates in the
developing countries alone.
The results of the first experiment indicate that agricultural policy
reform in the OECD countries will have significant impacts on world prices

of a limited number of commodities, mainly dairy, beef, sugar and wheat.
The main gainers from this reform are the OECD countries themselves.
The developing countries as a whole experience a small gain; among this
group food exporters are likely to be the main beneficiaries.
In marked contrast with this result, when the policy reform is extended
to all countries, there is a substantial increase in the benefits going to the
developing countries, indicating clearly that the major source of welfare
gains for this group of countries is the reform of their own policies. While
still small relative to GDP, the gains to the developing countries from partial
liberalization undertaken by all countries are considerably larger than
those reported in earlier studies.
It seems that the developing countries in aggregate could expect to
achieve small welfare gains if the Dunkel package were implemented by
the developed countries alone and the developing countries chose not to
participate in the liberalization process. Very much larger gains would be
realized if the developing countries choose to participate wholeheartedly in
the world trading system by undertaking agricultural reforms of their own.
If the developing countries instead choose to participate in a GATT
agreement along the lines of the Dunkel proposal and reduce only their
positive assistance to agriculture, they might still experience a relatively
significant gain. In the non-participation scenario, a significant minority of
developing country regions could be expected to suffer welfare losses. By
contrast, in the active participation scenarios, only a small number of
developing country regions would be expected to lose, and the magnitude
of these losses would be extremely small relative to the gains to other
developing regions.
The potential gains discussed in this paper capture only a portion of the
potential gains from a comprehensive move to liberalization in world
agriculture. Even if the gains from an initial liberalization were small, there
would likely be future gains from the incorporation, at last, of agriculture
within the multilateral trading system. As is evident from the experience of
manufactures where average protection levels have been reduced dramatically over a series of GATT rounds, the incorporation of agriculture in
GATT could have very major long term benefits. Further, the stimulus to
productivity in developing countries provided by liberalization would have
cumulative benefits, compounding the gains reported in this paper.
