Abstract
Kebede, Y., Gunjal, K. and Coffin, G., 1990. Adoption of new technologies in Ethiopian agriculture: the case ofTegulet-Bulga District, Shoa Province. Agric. Econ., 4: 27-43.
Adoption of agricultural production technologies in developing countries is influenced by a wide
range of economic and social factors as well as physical and technical aspects of farming and the
risk attitude of farmers. It is important to understand the role of these factors to ensure the
development of appropriate technologies and the design of successful development projects. This
study examines the impact of such factors on the adoption of single-ox, fertilizer and pesticide
technologies as part of a post-drought recovery project in Tegulet-Bulga district in Ethiopia.
Models to evaluate the probability of adoption are specified for the respective technologies and
are estimated using a logit maximum likelihood procedure. results indicate that the most significant variable affecting the probability of adoption of all three technologies is farm size; the impact
is negative for single-ox technology and positive for fertilizer and pesticide use. Economic factors
such as income, wealth and debt generally exhibit statistically significant influence on the adoption of single-ox and pesticide technologies as do family size, access to outside information, education and experience.
The effect of socio-economic factors on adoption of fertilizer and pesticide technologies is greater
in the area which has more access to outside information and off-farm activities (Ankober) than
in more 'self-contained' area (Seladengay). The impact of the degree of risk aversion of farmers
is found to be significant and negative for single-ox technology in both areas, and for fertilizer and
pesticide technologies in only one area. The predicted probabilities of technology adoption by an
average farmer are found to increase dramatically with the level of education and access or exposure to outside information.

Introduction

cused on emergency relief, the important element of post-drought recovery,
and the long-term food supply, is the provision and adoption of appropriate
production technologies.
Development programs in Ethiopia over the past two decades, have included
several new technologies. Among the most recently introduced are single-ox,
pesticides and fertilizer usage. However, there has not been a wide-spread provision and adoption of these technologies in the central highlands of Ethiopia.
Various socio-economic factors and the degree of risk aversion may be the causes
oflow adoption rates (Teele, 1975; Jamison and Lau, 1982; O'Mara, 1983; Roe,
1983; Shakya and Flinn, 1985).
The main objective of this paper, therefore, is to demonstrate how the various economic, social, and physical variables and degree of risk aversion affect
the adoption of three selected technologies in Ethiopian agriculture. In addition, this study will also focus on how sequential (recursive) decisions are
implemented.
Study sites

The study sites of Ankober and Seladengay sub-districts of Tegulet-Bulga
district of Shoa administrative region are located in central Ethiopian highlands. Because of geographical barriers (lack of roads and other means of communication) the study areas had never been accessed by any development project until1984. The main characteristics of the farmers in these areas are given
in Table 1. Seladengay area has a longer tradition of farming with slightly

larger farm size, higher farm income and slightly larger family size than

These areas were among the regions affected by the major drought of 1984/
85. The farmers were assisted by a recovery project financed by Oxfam America, Oxfam UK, Medios of Belgium, CFAF of France and other donor agencies.
Technical assistance was provided by the International Livestock Center for
Africa (ILCA). Data were collected the year following the drought when crop
production was relatively good.
Characteristics of the technologies: single-ox, fertilizers and
pesticides

Traditionally, Ethiopian farmers have used a pair of oxen for traction. However, studies of the Ethiopian highland reclamation have found that most
farmers do not posses a pair of oxen (Constable, 1983). The rapid increase in
population has increased competition for arable land and has resulted in declining grazing areas and animal population (Ministry of Agriculture, 1982).
At the same time, raising a large number of animals on limited land has exposed both arable and non -arable lands to soil erosion.
To overcome the problem of a shortage of oxen, Ethiopian farmers have been
using traditional resource-exchange arrangements (McCann, 1986). The
practice of exchanging grain for oxen became unaffordable for many small
farmers after the drought. In order to reduce soil erosion and avoid farm indebtedness from traditional exchange arrangements, ILCA developed a modified form of traction implement to be pulled by a single-ox rather than the
conventionally used pair ( Gryseels et al., 1984). Thus, single-ox technology
was one aspect of the post-drought recovery project.
The second technology provided to farmers is pesticides. Insects such as
grasshoppers and American ball worms pose a serious problem in both study
sites. Therefore, under this project, farmers were provided with a small amount
of pesticides at a normal market price on an interest-free loan to be repaid in
3 years.
The third production technology considered is the provision of inorganic
fertilizers. In order to reduce the loss of fertility of their farm lands, some
farmers have tried to use farm yard manure (FYM). But the FYM practice
requires more livestock to produce enough manure. It also requires more labour
than that provided by 4 to 5 family members to distribute the manure on the
field. Therefore, the practice is mostly restricted to gardens. Where inorganic
fertilizer has been used yields are generally much higher. Inorganic fertilizer is
provided through the Ministry of Agriculture at a price set by the government.
Not all farmers used or intended to use the above three production technologies. The thrust of this study is, therefore, to identify the factors that moti-

30

vated farmers to use or not to use single-ox, pesticides and fertilizer, and the
extent to which these factors were influential in farmers' decisions.

Models of adoption behaviour
A number of studies have investigated the influence of various socio-economic factors on the willingness of decision makers to use new technologies
(Nerlove and Press, 1973; Roe, 1983; Shakya and Flinn, 1985). In most studies
of adoption behaviour the dependent variable is constrained to lie between 0
and 1 and the models used are exponential functions. Univariate and multivariate logit and probit models and their modified forms have been used extensively to study the adoption behaviour offarmers and consumers (Nerlove and
Press, 1973; Schmidt and Strauss, 1975; Garcia et al., 1983; Shakya and Flinn,
1985).
Maddala ( 1983) and Shakya and Flinn ( 1985) have recommended probit
models for functional forms with limited dependent variables that are continuous between 0 and 1, and logit models for discrete dependent variables. In this
study the responses recorded are discrete (mutually exclusive and exhaustive)
and therefore a univariate logit model will be developed.
For analysis of the adoption of technology packages, some studies have proposed simultaneous decision models (Feder et al., 1985). Observed behaviour
in some areas, however, has revealed that there is a recursive decision-making
process where those inputs considered critical to farm survival are adopted
first, followed by inputs which are believed to increase yield. For instance, the
intention to use fertilizer depends on the decision made regarding how to prevent crop losses from insects and diseases if the latter is a priority problem.
In making decisions about the adoption of a given technology, farmers are
assumed to weigh the consequences of adoption of an innovation against its
economic, social, and technical feasibility. If we assume that social values or
technical achievements are a reflection of the level of economic achievements,
then a farmer evaluates the new technology in terms of its incremental benefit.
Naturally, if the monetary benefit from a technology is higher, the preference
or utility ( U) for that technology (assuming a monotonic relationship between
benefits and utility) will be higher.
Suppose an individual household's preference (utility) of adopting a new
technology, for a given vector of economic, social and physical factors (X) is
denoted by UN(X) and the preference (utility) of adopting the traditional
technology by UT (X). Then, the preference for adopting the new and old technologies can be defined as a linear relationship:
UN(X)=XBN+EN

(1)

UT(X)=XBT+ET

(2)

31

where BN, BT and EN, ET are response coefficients and random disturbances
associated with the adoption of new and traditional technologies, respectively.
If the index of adoption is denoted by Y, it will take a value of one if the farmer
is willing to adopt the new technology and zero otherwise.
The probability that a given farmer will adopt the new technology can be
expressed as a function of X as follows:
P(Y=1) =P(UN > UT)

(3)

=P(XBN +EN> XBT + ET)
=P[X(BN -BT) >ET -EN]
=P(XB>E)
=F(XB)

(3a)

where Pis the probability function, B = (BN- BT) a vector of unknown parameters which can be interpreted as the net influence ofthe vector of independent
variables on adoption of the new technology, E = (ET- EN) a random disturbance term and F(XB) is cumulative distribution function F evaluated at XB
(for details see Rahm and Huffman, 1984).
According to the logit model, the probability of an individual household
adopting a technology, given economic, social and physical characteristics (X),
is P (NIX) and can be specified as:
P(NIX) =exp(XB+E)/{1+exp(XB+ E)}
where

(4)

-oo<XB<oo

The probability of adoption of the traditional technology, P ( T IX), is therefore,
P(TIX)=1-P(NIX)
=1- [exp(XB+E)/{1+exp(XB+E)}]
=1/{1+exp(XB+E)}

(5)

The relative odds of adopting versus not adopting a new technology are given
by:
P(NIX)/P(TIX) = [exp(XB+E)] [1+exp(XB+E) ]/[1+exp(XB+E)]
=exp(XB+E)

(6)

taking the logarithms of both sides,
ln[P(NIX)/P(TIX)] =XB+E

(7)

The final decision of farmers is a reflection of various factors including their

32

risk preference and socio-economic environment. The risk preference of a decision maker is, itself, a function of economic and social factors. Some studies
have included risk preference along with other factors in adoption models (Roe,
1983). If both sets of variables are included in the models of adoption studies,
however, there will be high degree multicollinearity. In this study, therefore,
some of the socio-economic variables are discarded in order to reduce the problem of multicollinearity (Moock, 1981) and avoid problems of lack of convergence (Harrel, 1985 ).
Empirical model specification
The probability of adoption of single-ox technology, PA ( S), was specified as
a function of economic, social and physical factors as follows:
PA(ST =f(XIJ ... , X12)

(8)

where the economic factors include:
X 1 After-tax farm income (100 birr)
X 2 off-farm (out side own farm) income ( 100 birr)
X 3 value of livestock and farm equipment (100 birr)
x4 debt ( 100 birr) and
X 5 farm size ( ha),
the social factors include:
x6 family size,
X 7 education (recorded as 0 or 1),
X 8 index of awareness (e.g., exposure to outside information)
X 9 number of relatives, and
xlO years of farming experience
and the physical factors include:
X 11 degree of difficulty in plowing arising from plot characteristics, (e.g., soil
type, stone coverage and slope), and
x12 difficulty in plowing due to inadequacy of traction power provided by a
single ox.
A model of adoption of pesticides, PA(PT), was specified as a function of
variables xl to xlO. Adoption offertilizer, PA(FT), was specified as a function
of variables xl to Xn plus adoption of pesticides, PA(PT) 1. Off-farm income
(X2 ) does not appear in adoption models for Seladengay because of the absence of measurable income outside households' own farm in this area.
2.07 Ethiopian birr is equivalent to US $1.00.
relationship of plot characteristics (X11 ) to adoption of pesticides is not critical as far as
effectiveness of this input is concerned. Thus, it does not appear in pesticide model. Also, difficulty
in traction power (X12 ) does not directly influence adoption of pesticides and fertilizer because
these are inputs used after completing field preparation.
1 The

33

All variables were used as quantified by respondents except the index of
awareness (X8 ) and plot characteristics (X11 ). These variables were approximated as follows.

(9)
The variable C1 is the relative number of city visits measured as the number of
visits a farmer makes to the nearby towns and market places per year divided
by the highest number of visits in the sample. This way the ratio ( C1 ) is constrained to lie between 0 and 1. Owning a radio ( C2 ) was given a value of 1 and
0 otherwise. A farmer who owns a radio is assumed to listen to news from
outside and thus expected to have a 100% exposure to outside information
compared to farmers who do not own radio. Although C1 is continuous (between 0 and 1) and C2 is discrete, the need to capture the influence from both
factors and at the same time to reduce the number of variables has necessitated
the construction of this index. 2
In the case of plot characteristic:
(10)
where each of the variables takes 0, 1 values as defined below:
8 1 = 1 if more than 50% of the plots are located in hilly areas, 0 otherwise;
8 2 = 1 if the soil type poses problems for plowing, especially with single ox, as
judged by the farmer (e.g., heavy clay soils), and 0 otherwise;
8 3 = 1 if more than 50% of the plot is covered with stones, and 0 otherwise.
It would be more accurate to have a measurable variable for draft power of
an ox (X12 ) (e.g., in horsepower). However, this was not possible. Instead,
farmers were asked to give an evaluation of their respective ox with respect to
its capacity when used to plow alone. Those who have seen or anticipated difficulty were given a value of one and zero otherwise. This indicates the technical feasibility of single-ox technology as judged by the farmers.
In order to see the influence of risk aversion and variables less correlated
with risk on adoption of the three production technologies, the following logit
regressions were specified:
PA(ST) =f[R(X), X 11 , X12]

(11)

PA(PT) =f[R(X)].

(12)

PA(FT) =f[R(X), PA(PT)]

(13)

where R (X) is the measure of relative risk aversion. This variable was meaIn fact, group discussion with farmers has revealed that farmers who do not own radio have less
knowledge about the effect of technologies on agricultural production. Thus, the index, although
involving aggregate bias, is believed to provide some measure about the influence of outside information which would not otherwise have been studied.

sured as follows. Risk attitudes were elicited by the Ramsey method using distribution of wealth. First, the absolute risk aversion coefficients were estimated using the negative exponential function (Buccola et al., 1978) given by:
U=K-{ (d) exp( -bM)}

K,M, b>O

(14)

where U is the utility index constructed by chaining lotteries, K is an additive
adjustment factor, dis an unknown scale parameter, exp is an exponent, b is
the absolute risk aversion coefficient, and M is a monetary pay-off. Then, the
relative risk aversion coefficient values were derived by multiplying b by the
value of the wealth of each farmer.
Sample
For the technology adoption model, a sample of 100 farmers from Ankober
and 80 farmers from Seladengay was randomly chosen. However, due to time,
money and personnel constraints the respective sample size for adoption models
involving the risk aversion coefficient were limited to 25 and 22. Farmers who
had used the technology and/ or who had planned to use it next season were
categorized as adopters ( PA = 1) and those who were not willing to use it as
non -adopters (PA = 0). Farmers did not use the technologies during the period
of this study but who were planning to use them the next season were asked to
estimate the benefits and identify constraints from using these technologies.
This was accomplished through the farmers own expectations, based on the
impact of these technologies on the field of others. Finally, any over- or underestimation of benefits from using these technologies especially from farmers
who were planning to use them the following season were corrected on the basis
of a second and third-round interviews.
Empirical results
Assuming a normally distributed error term (E) in equation (3a), the logit
maximum likelihood (LML) estimation procedure was used to obtain consistent, efficient and asymptotically normal estimators (Amemiya, 1981; Maddala, 1983; Rahm and Huffman, 1984; Capps and Kramer, 1985). The estimates are summarized in Table 2 for Ankober and Seladengay areas and the
results are discussed below.
Economic factors

As expected, after-tax farm and off-farm incomes have positive effects on
adoption of the three production technologies. The only exception is fertilizer
technology (FT) in Ankober where a negative but nonsignificant effect was

observed. The positive effect of one extra Ethiopian birr of income is smallest
on the probability of adoption of single-ox technology ( ST) and largest on the
probability of adoption of pesticide technology (PT) for Ankober. 3 The effects
though the calculus of probability i~ logit models is not the same as in linear probability
models, the magnitude of the probability is highly influenced by the value of estimated coefficients.
Thus, it is possible to suggest the direction of the effect on the basis of the coefficients (Aldrich

36

of after-tax farm income on PT and off-farm income on ST were significant
only for Ankober. It is also evident that the monetary benefit (measured by
the size of the coefficient of farm income) of single-ox and fertilizer technologies has a much larger impact in Seladengay than in Ankober.
The more wealth a farmer has, the more likely he is to adopt a new technology. More wealth also implies the ability to buy another ox or availability of
cow(s) to be used for draft purposes, hence exerting a negative influence on
adoption of ST. The effect of wealth is found to be positive but nonsignificant
on adoption of pesticides. The negative effect of wealth on adoption of ST in
Ankober is as expected. The positive and significant effect ofwealth on adoption of ST as observed in Seladengay requires additional explanation. The practice of using a cow with an ox for traction is more common in Seladengay than
in Ankober. Thus, the more livestock (hence cows) households have the more
willing they may be to use a single-ox.
The larger the debt a farmer has to pay ( X 4 ), the less willing he is to use new
technologies from which the benefit is uncertain. However, heavily indebted
farmers may be willing to try ST and save on oxen resource more than the less
indebted farmers.
The debt level has the anticipated effect of inhibiting ability to adopt as seen
from its negative effect on adoption of PT and F T in both areas. Similarly, as
anticipated, its effect on adoption of ST is positive. The significant effect of
debt on adoption of F T for Seladengay might imply that farmers in this area
are more risk averse than the farmers in Ankober.
As farm size (X5 ) increases farmers need more traction power. If a farmer
judges the traction power provided by a single-ox to be inadequate to complete
critical field operations on time, then the larger the farm size, the lower is the
probability of adopting ST. Generally, an increase in farm size is likely to increase the probability of adoption of PT and FT (see reviews by Feder et al.,
1985).
As seen from Table 2, farm size has a negative effect on adoption of ST and
a positive effect on adoption of PT and F T as anticipated. This variable has the
most significant effect on adoption of all production technologies except on
the ST for Seladengay. The negative but non-significant effect of farm size on
adoption of ST for Seladengay may be because of limited scope for expanding
farm size compared to Ankober.
With the use of pesticides, if a farmer can prevent crop loss and obtain a
good harvest, then he may want to increase his farm income by using fertilizer.
Therefore, the decision to use pesticides can have a positive effect on the decision to use fertilizer.
As anticipated, the argument of the complementarity between pesticides and
fertilizer and the recursive decision-making of farmers with respect to allocation of funds to these inputs is supported by a positive effect of PT on the
adoption ofFTÂ·

37
Social factors

Household decision-making with respect to the farming operation is influenced not only by the ecol).omic merits of actions but also by social factors
pertinent to the household and those operating at community level. The influence of few of these factors on adoption of technologies is discussed below.
A large family often has a large number of working members. If this is the
case, then there will be more labour to exchange for an additional ox or to
perform supplementary farming operations such as furrow-making and other
manual cultivations. The larger the family (X6 ), other things being constant,
the higher will be the probability of adoption of single-ox, pesticides and fertilizer technologies.
As anticipated, family size has a positive effect on F T for both areas but a
mixed effect on adoption of PT and ST. The mixed effect may be because of
some unknown influences which were not captured by variables included in
the model.
In this part of Ethiopia, education (X 7 ) consists mainly of pre-school teaching through churches and the government literacy campaigns. Accordingly,
education is expected to have a positive effect on adoption of all three production technologies.
The results show that education has a positive effect in most cases. However,
the level of significance is fairly low. This may, in part, be due to the large
number of variables, given a sample size of 100 or less and the dichotomous
measurement ( 0, 1) of this variable as opposed other ways of measuring
education.
As with education, the index of exposure to outside information (X8 ) is found
to have a positive effect on the probability of adoption in most cases. However,
in he statistical sense this hypothesis is supported in only two out of the six
cases tested.
If relatives (X 9 ) are seen as a source of additional help in case of need, then
a farmer may try new practices. If they are seen as dependents, then he may
not be willing to adopt new technology. A previous study by Gunjal (1987)
found that in Seladengay the 'number of relatives' exerted a significant positive effect on the degree of risk aversion. In this study, the number of relatives
(X9 ) is found to have positive but non-significant effect in most cases.
Farming experience (X10 ), which is assumed to be monotonic with age, has
shown that, given the short rainy season, it is necessary to complete field operations on time. Thus, the more experience farmers have the less likely that
they will use a single-ox. On the other hand, the more experience a farmer has
in recognizing the importance of pests and the decline in fertility status of his
farm lands, the higher is the probability of adopting PT and F TÂ·
The finding that experience (age) exerts a negative effect on adoption of
single-ox and fertilizer technologies and a positive effect on adoption of pes-

38

ticides is consistent with the general observation among the central highland
Ethiopian farmers. Pesticides are seen as the only means (input) to control
pests, so even older farmers are willing to make use of them. The single-ox and
fertilizer represent, respectively, changes in traditional cultural practices and
uncertain benefits because of rainfall variability. Thus, older farmers are less
likely to use these technologies.
Physical factors

Agricultural technologies are developed to help farmers overcome some of
the physical or technical constraints to production. Two of these physical or
technical factors are considered below.
The higher the value of the index of plot characteristics, X 11 , the more difficult it is to work the soil with single-ox. It also makes any investment in
inputs such as fertilizer used on those plots less attractiv.e implying a negative
effect of X 11 on the adoption ofPT and FT.
The result show that X 11 has the anticipated negative effect on adoption of
ST, but the result is found statistically non -significant. This could be partly
due to measurement problems with respect to capturing the variability of factors such as moisture content, physical and chemical properties of the soil,
exact slopes etc. The plot characteristics variable was found highly correlated
with the adoption of pesticide in the fertilizer model and convergence could
not be reached. Therefore, this variable was dropped from the final model for
fertilizer adoption.
Traction power provided by the Zebu breed is very low compared to the bullocks used in Asia (Reddy, 1982). Accordingly, the need to secure subsistence
for the family might force decision makers to use more dependable sources of
traction power such as a pair of oxen instead of a single-ox.
As expected, the difficulty in traction power results in a negative and significant effect on adoption of ST in both regions. This implies that, given the
present state of animal traction technology, the use of a single-ox may not be
viewed by farmers as being very practical, irrespective of the plot characteristics.
Finally, joint testing of social, economic and physical factors has shown that
economic factors exert statistically significant influence on divisible technologies (such as P T and F T) and that in areas where the family structure and the
degree of social ties among extended families is much stronger, social factors
exert a significant influence on adoption.
Risk and adoption of technologies

The purpose of this section is to see how the degree of risk aversion, R (X),
affects the adoption of the three production technologies. Initially, the models
in equations (11), (12) and (13) were estimated. Some of the socio-economic

39

variables that are not highly correlated with R (X) (i.e., correlation coefficient
less than 0.6) are later added to the final estimated equations. The results of
these models are presented in Table 3.
In general, the more risk averse a farmer is, the less willing he is to change
the traditional practices and try new technologies. The interpretation and the
influence of the various socio-economic factors on adoption of the three production technologies is the same as in the adoption models discussed earlier.
The chi -square values for testing the effects of all variables except the intercept
on adoption are significantly different from zero for both areas.
In a separate study, most farmers in both study sites were found to be moderately to extremely risk averse in relative terms ( Gunjal, 1987) implying that
they are less willing to adopt new inputs. TheÂ· results of this study indicate
similar effects for adoption of ST in both areas and for adoption of PT and F T

for Seladengay. The positive but non-significant effect of risk aversion on
adoption ofPTandFT for Ankober may be due to rainfall irregularities or other
unexplained factors.
Predicted probabilities
The estimated models (shown in Table 2) were used to predict probabilities
of adoption of the three technologies at the mean level of explanatory variables.
As shown in Table 4, farmers in Ankober consistently exhibit higher probability of adoption of all three production technologies than farmers in Seladengay.
The largest absolute difference in the probability of adoption occurs with respect to adoption of the single-ox technology. This can be attributed mainly to
the fact that farmers in Seladengay show a greater tendency towards maintaining traditional cultural practices and have less outside contact to influence
their decision making than farmers in Ankober. On the other hand, evaluation
of the influence of education on the probability of adoption, holding other factors at the mean level, shows a larger increase in the probability of adoption of
the three technologies in Seladengay than in Ankober. 4 This implies that improved education may have a substantial impact on the adoption of new
technologies.
The percentages of farmers who were willing to use single-ox, pesticide and
fertilizer for Ankober were respectively 54, 56 and 62%, while for Seladengay
the respective values were 33, 63 and 66%. From reviews of adoption studies
in developing countries (e.g., Feder et al., 1985) this rate of adoption seems
high. It is possible that these rates are over-estimated due to interest-free credit
and other perceived fringe benefits from the project. 62%,

Conclusions
The estimated models of adoption behaviour of farmers in Ethiopia indicate
that economic and technical feasibility alone are not a guarantee for the adoption of technology. Social factors and the degree of risk aversion are equally
important.
The most significant economic factor affecting adoption of single-ox, pesticides and fertilizer technologies is farm size and the most significant social
factor is farming experience. The impact of a change in farm size (i.e., tenure
reform) is likely to have a positive impact on production augmenting technologies (pesticides and fertilizer) but a negative effect on resource saving technology (single-ox). More precisely, a one percent change in farm size (at the
mean level of this and other variables) is expected to change the probability of
adoption of ST, PT and F T by -9, + 1 and + 2 percent for Seladengay and by
-3, + 0.6 and + 1 percent for Ankober, respectively.
It has also been shown that farming experience exerts a negative influence
on adoption of more risky technologies (e.g. single-ox and fertilizer) and a
positive influence on the adoption of less risky technology (e.g. pesticides).
This is consistent with the general observation that most Ethiopian highland
farmers consider pesticide as the number one priority input. The high level of
significance of traction power also leads to a conclusion that improvement in
health and physical condition of oxen would make the single-ox technology
more practical and acceptable. Similarly, other desirable modifications in
plowing implements may also make this technology more acceptable to farmers.
The degree of risk aversion exerts a negative influence on the adoption of
production technologies in most cases. Given that adoption of technologies is
a necessary step towards increasing food production, it is essential to reduce
the level of risk aversion through better education, outside contact and other
appropriate measures. The results show that the impact of education on the
probability of adoption of each of the three technologies is substantial.
Thus, policies designed to improve the economic, social and physical factors
affecting farming systems, similar to Ankober and Seladengay areas, are likely
to help increase the participation of farmers in development projects involving
new agricultural technologies and increase food production in Ethiopia.
