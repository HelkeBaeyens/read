Abstract
This paper investigates patterns of soil conservation adoption among low-income farmers in the Philippines. A model is presented that
focuses attention on the role of assets and consumption risk in influencing soil conservation adoption decisions. Results from a reduced-form
probit model of adoption are reported. These econometric findings indicate that patterns of soil conservation adoption reflect relative risk
considerations in addition to farm and household characteristics. Farm size, tenure security, labor availability, and land quality all exhibit a
positive association with soil conservation adoption. In contrast, controlling on these and other household characteristics, the probability of
adoption falls as consumption risk rises. These results underscore a need for greater sensitivity among policymakers to the role of
consumption risk in influencing soil conservation decisions in low-income settings. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

1. Introduction
Land degradation is an important economic and
environmental policy problem in developing countries. To maintain farm incomes and reduce externalities associated with erosive agricultural techniques,
considerable effort has been directed toward identifying and promoting profitable soil conservation strategies in low-income countries. 1 However, as many

observers now recognize, profitability is necessary
but rarely sufficient to ensure soil conservation adoption (Barbier and Bishop, 1995; Ervin and Ervin,
1982; L6pez-Pereira et al., 1994). In low-income
settings, where asset holdings are modest and borrowing for consumption is difficult, economic constraints can be important determinants of investment
patterns (Reardon and Vosti, 1995). The primary
thesis of this paper is that the income risk associated
with soil conservation measures can discourage
adoption by resource-constrained farmers.
To test this thesis, this paper investigates the
respective roles of assets and relative risk in explaining patterns of contour hedgerow adoption in the
Philippines. Contour hedgerows are permanent vegetative barriers planted across the width of a field and

spaced 5-10 m apart. The barriers restrict soil and
water movement, and enhance nutrient recycling.
Annual crops are planted in the areas between the
hedgerows. A primary advantage of hedgerows compared with other soil conservation measures such as
rock walls and terraces is their relatively low labor
and material cost for construction. However, an important drawback with hedgerows is their opportunity cost and impact on traditional agricultural practices. They occupy cultivable space and 5-7 years
may be required before their yield-augmenting properties compensate for foregone grain. Despite being
profitable in the long run, the initial consumption
loss can discourage adoption on small or resourcepoor farms.
This paper is empirically oriented. However, it
also seeks to extend the framework for studying
adoption decisions by presenting a model that focuses specific attention on the role of risk in conditioning adoption. 2 The paper investigates the empirical roles of assets and relative risk in explaining
patterns of hedgerow adoption. A reduced form
model is estimated using data from a sample of
Philippine farms. Econometric findings demonstrate
that patterns of soil conservation adoption reflect
relative risk considerations in addition to farm and
household characteristics. Results underscore a need
for greater sensitivity among policymakers to the
role of consumption risk in influencing soil conservation decisions in low-income settings.

2. Soil conservation adoption and risk

2.1. Model specification
The potential impact of consumption risk on
hedgerow adoption can be illustrated using a simplified model of an agriq.Iltural household. The house-

hold is assumed to maximize its expected returns
from farming, i.e.,:
Max E[

fj 17T1 (rt)

l

subject to the definition of farm income:
7T 1

(

=A[f(S,e,x,s) -c(e,x)] +wL+I

(2)

and a household-specific safety-first constraint:
Pr( 7T 1 <D)~

a

'rft.

(3)

In Eq. (1), fj is a per-period discount factor; 7T1 is
per-period net farm income, and e = {0,1} denotes
the use of hedgerows. In Eq. (2), A denotes farm
size; f(S,x,e,s) is a stochastic production function
that depends on the soil stock (S), conservation
effortS ( 8 ), other inputs (X), and a stochastic shock
( s ); and c( e, x) is a cost function. Eq. (2) also
includes noncrop income which is the combination
of nonwage income (I) and labor ( L) supplied at the
wage rate ( w ). In Eq. (3), D is a threshold or critical
level of income and a denotes a maximum allowable probability of falling below the threshold. Bigman (1996) provides a review of safety-first criteria.
As indicated above, the benefits associated with
hedgerows appear with a delay. For example, if fo
denotes production without soil conservation and / 1
denotes production with soil conservation, it may be
the case that fo > f 1 early in the planning horizon
and f 1 > fo in later years. An initial 'negative flow'
is typical for investments in soil conservation, and
may be particularly important to resource-constrained farmers operating near their threshold income level.
The inclusion of the safety-first constraint in the
farmer's problem means that the decision maker
must evaluate expected returns in terms of a probability distribution for minimum income. This distribution will depend on the income-earning capacity
of the household. Although restrictions could be used
to specify a closed form for the conditional probability distribution of returns, a more general approach is
to re-express the safety-first constraint as:
1r1(8)

2 In this study, adoption is framed as a binary choice. For an
analysis of two-stage adoption decisions (i.e., a yesjno decision
followed by an acreage decision) see Lohr and Park (1995).

3 Optimal control models based on Eqs. (1) and (2) are typically maximized subject to an equation of motion for the soil
stock (e.g., Barbier, 1988; Barrett, 1991; LaFrance, 1992).

G.E. Shively/ Agricultural Economics 17 ( 1997) 165-177

where F- 1 (a) aw is the inverse of the distribution
function of returns and aw is a measure of spread
(Boussard, 1979).
Maximization of Eq. (1) subject to Eqs. (2) and
(3') leads to an optimum where in each period

Eq. (5) is a marginal benefit-marginal cost condition for adoption that explicitly accounts for the cost
of adoption in terms of its impact on the safety-first
constraint in each period. If this constraint is binding
(i.e., if A> 0), adoption decisions will not be based
solely on a comparison of net benefit flows between
techniques, but will also depend on farm size, nonfarm income, and the impact of adoption on the
probability of consumption shortfall.

2.2. The adoption decision
Inverting Eq. (5) leads to a demand function for
soil conservation investments of the form:

(6)
Eq. (6) says that the decision regarding soil conservation adoption will depend on farm size, the cost
of adoption, and the shape of the expected probability distribution associated with the safety-first constraint. The probability distribution is conditioned on
the income-earning capacity of the household. Given
the probabilistic nature of the safety-first constraint,
expectations will clearly influence adoption decisions. Furthermore, by influencing technology performance or adoption cost, farm-specific attributes
such as land quality or slope may also influence
adoption decisions. Including the safety-first constraint in the adoption problem underscores the point
that when technology adoption is costly, it has the
potential to push a lo~-income hdusehold below its
disaster level. One would therefore expect adoption
decisions to be influenced by (and explained by) the
productive capacity of the household. Eq. (6) therefore serves as the basis for the reduced-form empirical model investigated below.

3. Sample description

3.1. Description of data and study site
Data used to estimate the model are drawn from a
1994-1995 farm survey of 115 com producers in an
upland area near Bansalan, in the Philippine province
of Davao del Sur. The site is described in Garcia et
al. (1995). Farms are located at elevations of 10001500 m above sea level. A majority of sample farms
lie at or above 18% slope, and annual rates of soil
erosion in the area have been estimated at 100 tjha
(Latada et al., 1994). The combination of land degradation, small farm sizes ( < 3 ha), low yields (1350
kgjha), and low incomes (US$600 per household)
means that many families in the area cannot reliably
maintain household food security.

3.2. Farm characteristics and the opportunity cost of
soil conservation
Estimates of the labor and opportunity costs of
hedgerow construction are summarized in Table 1.
The consumption risk embodied in soil conservation
adoption is directly related to the opportunity cost of
hedgerows. This opportunity cost can be calculated
in terms of the foregone grain associated with the
area occupied by hedgerows. The estimate of opportunity cost for each parcel is based on recommended
hedgerow spacing for observed field slope, and was
converted to a grain-equivalent measure using the
sample average yield. The opportunity cost of adoption on a parcel is measured as a ratio. The numerator is the cumulative amount of grain that would
have been foregone if hedgerows had been constructed at the recommended intensity on the parcel;
the denominator is the total household com harvest
of the previous year. Based on extension estimates,
lab~r required for establishment was assumed to be
40 -days /ha. This-' value was converted to grain
equivalents using the local agricultural wage (50
pesos/ day) and the prevailing wholesale market price
of com (5 pesos/kg).
The entries in Table 1 suggest that per-hectare
labor requirements for hedgerow adoption were rather

low, typically on the order of 4-7% of available
household labor. Conversely, the opportunity cost of
land used for hedgerows was quite high, especially
for small farms on steep fields (where greater
hedgerow intensity is required to reduce erosion). As
the entries in Table 1 indicate, in the initial years of
adoption the cumulative amount of grain foregone
due to hedgerow construction on a parcel was about
80% of the annual available supply for a household
in the lowest farm-size quintile, and about 15% for a
household in the highest farm-size quintile. These
high measures of opportunity cost reflect three facts.
First, the output gap between traditional and
hedgerow plots can be as much as 25% of output
during the initial years of hedgerow establishment.
Second, it typically takes 5-7 years for the yield
augmenting properties of hedgerows to erase this
gap. And third, small farms typically rely on a single
parcel of land to meet food production needs while
large farms spread production over several parcels.
The opportunity cost of adopting hedgerows on any
single parcel therefore tends to be higher on small
farms than on large farms. The overall cost (in terms
of labor, land, and materials) of establishing
hedgerows ranged from 16 to 55% of total annual
income on average. At the time of the survey, 60%
of sample farmers had adopted contour hedgerows
on one or more parcels.
3.3. Farm characteristics
Table 2 reports average values observed for variables considered in this analysis. The first three
columns in Table 2 correspond to values for the full
household sample of adopters and non-adopters; the
last three columns correspond to a subsample of
plots (both with and without hedgerows) for which
detailed plot-level information was available. 4 Independent variables are presented in four groups: (A)
assets; (B) off-farm income; (C) farmer characteristics; and (D) plot characteristics.

4 Plot-level data are a subset of the farm-level data and contain
a larger proportion of second-season harvests. Farmers who planted
com during the second cropping season had larger farms, more
non-agricultural income, and higher first-season yields than their
cohorts.

3.3.1. Assets
Assets considered in this study include farm size,
tenure security, and labor quantity and quality. As a
factor of production and store of wealth, land is
probably the most important asset influencing adoption. Land provides collateral and is one of the few
sources of credit and liquidity for low-income households. For these reasons, one might expect a household's willingness or capacity to invest in soil conservation to be positively correlated with farm size.
For example, models of technology adoption that
explicitly account for farm size and risk predict
higher adoption rates on large farms (Feder and
O'Mara, 1981; Just and Zilberman, 1983; Feder et
al., 1985). Similarly, empirical studies from LDCs
have indicated that agroforestry adoption rates are
higher on large farms (Scherr, 1995), and that farmers regard small farm size as a barrier to investing in
soil conservation (Fujisaka, 1993). 5 In the regressions, farm size is expressed as area per adult-equivalent unit.
Land ownership is also likely to be an important
determinant of adoption. Tenure security can influence access to credit, the length of a household's
planning horizon, or a household's willingness to
invest. Although investments in soil conservation
have been found to be lower on rented land than
owned land (e.g., Clay and Reardon, 1994), ambiguity can sometimes arise regarding the role of tenure
security in influencing adoption. For example, while
tenure security may be a precondition for investments in maintaining land productivity, in some
settings investments may help farmers to obtain de
facto if not de jure land rights (Russell, 1986). This
logic applies to some extent in the study area for this
investigation. Most farms lie within Mt. Apo National Park on what is legally classified as public
land. Although this might be viewed as a situation of
tenure insecurity, farmers covered by traditional
tenure regimes nevertheless see agricultural investments as a way to legitimize their claim to the land,
and local authorities terfc:l to officially recognize tra-

5 However, as a reviewer has pointed out, a large farm size may
also allow longer rotations, which could reduce retums from
conservation and undermine incentives for soil conservation investments.

ditional -forms of tenure when good land-use practices are observed. For this reason, both traditional
land claims and titled ownership are classified as
secure tenure in this study. Rented land is classified
as insecure tenure. By this definition, approximately
75% of sample farms had secure tenure at the time
of the survey.
Labor requirements are widely regarded as a critical element influencing adoption of soil conservation
(Fujisaka, 1993; Harper and El-Swaify, 1988; Clay
and Reardon, 1994). Measures of both labor quantity
and labor quality are included in this study. Households had an average of two adult-male equivalent
workers and average labor capacity of approximately
500 days per year. In the regressions, labor availability is measured as man days per hectare. Land
quality is measured as educational attainment (in
years) among household heads.
3.3.2. Off-farm income
Results from previous studies suggest an ambiguous role for off-farm income in influencing soil
conservation adoption. A negative relationship may
reflect labor competition between off-farm activities
and farming, or may signal a shift in household
interests away from farming as a primary livelihood.
For example, in a previous study of soil conservation
adoption in the Philippines, de los Angeles (1986)
reported a negative correlation between the level of
non-farm income in a household, and the probability
of conservation adoption, and concluded that households without off-farm income had greater incentives
to maintain on-farm resources. In contrast, other
authors have argued that off-farm income provides
cash for investments in conservation, especially when
labor or materials must be acquired (e.g., Reardon
and Vosti, 1995). Two off-farm income variables are
used in this analysis. The first measures non-agricultural, nonwage income. The second measures wage
income. In both cases, the variable entered in the
regressions is expressed in pesos per adult-equivalent
unit.
3.3.3. Farmer characteristics
Farmer characteristics incorporated in the analysis
include an indicator of religious affiliation, a measure of attitudes toward hedgerows, and a subjective

171

estimate of hedgerow yields. Approximately 30% of
farmers in the sample reported membership in the
local Baptist church, a factor that is important for
this study because of a church-based extension program that promoted hedgerows in the area. An attitude measure is included because previous studies
have shown that farmer attitudes are important determinants of new technology adoption (e.g., Adesina
and Zinnah, 1993). An index of a decision maker's
attitude toward hedgerows is used. This index was
constructed using responses from a series of 10
questions regarding positive and negative aspects of
hedgerows. For each question a negative response
was recorded as -1, a positive response was
recorded as + 1, and indifference was recorded as 0.
The index, computed as the sum across the 10
questions, was centered and scaled so that it is
positive for decision makers who judge hedgerows
more favorably than average, and is negative for
decision makers who judge hedgerows less favorably
than average. The regressions also include a measure
of a farmer's estimate of the impact of hedgerows on
corn yields. Construction of this subjective yield
estimate is described in Appendix A. The variable is
a ratio computed as the farmer's yield estimate for a
hedgerow plot divided by his yield estimate for a
traditional plot. As constructed, this ratio exceeds 1
for farmers who consider hedgerows superior to
traditional methods of growing corn, falls below 1
for farmers who consider hedgerows relatively inferior to traditional techniques, and equals 1 for farmers who regard yields under the two techniques as
essentially similar. On average, both adopters and
non-adopters judged hedgerows as relatively more
productive than traditional techniques.

3.3.4. Plot characteristics
Plot characteristics used in the analysis include
parcel size, measures of land quality, and an estimate
of the opportunity cost of adoption. Two variables
represent land quality: soil depth and duration of use.
Soil depth on each parcel was imputed using data
from a recent soil survey. The duration of use variable is measured in months and was computed as the
total length of time since the parcel was first cropped,
minus any intervening periods of fallow. Both characteristics could be expected to influence adoption

172

because returns to soil conservation can be lower on
degraded land. Parcel slope is also included in the
analysis under the assumption that greater slope increases the cost of hedgerow adoption. As the entries
in Table 1 indicate, small farms tend to occupy
steeper land, a pattern that would suggest systematically higher costs of adoption on small farms.
Finally, in order to assess whether the fixed cost
of adopting hedgerows on a particular plot might
contribute to overall consumption risk in a household, a measure of the opportunity cost of adoption
is employed. This variable is measured as a ratio.
The numerator is the cumulative amount of forgone
grain associated with hedgerow construction on the
parcel. The denominator is the total annual com
harvest for the household from all parcels. 6 A small
value indicates that adoption would have reduced the
household com supply by a small proportion. A large
value indicates that adoption would have required a
farm to forgo an amount of grain that was a relatively large proportion of its typical com harvest.

4. Model estimation and results
A reduced-form model was used to relate
hedgerow adoption to variables outlined in Section 3.
Analysis was conducted at both the farm level and
the plot level. In the farm-level regressions, adoption
is registered as a binary variable equal to 1 if the
household adopted contour hedgerows anywhere on
the farm, and 0 otherwise. In the plot-level regressions, adoption is registered as a binary variable
equal to 1 if the household adopted contour
hedgerows on a specific plot and 0 otherwise. A
probit model was used under the assumptions that an
underlying (but unobserved) response variable describes a household's probability of technology

6 This ratio generally increases as farm size falls, although it
need not, since a large plot on a large farm may have a larger ratio
than a small plot on a small farm. The denominator of this
measure is an endogenous function of the adoption decision, but
the bias introduced in the regressions is in favor of a positive
coefficient on the regressor. Given the large and statistically
strong negative sign on the estimated coefficient, this statistical
bias is not of great concern.

adoption, and that unobserved disturbances are normally distributed. 7
Table 3 contains results from four probit regressions. Regressions A1 and A2 were conducted at the
farm level; regressions B1 and B2 were conducted at
the plot level. All regressions contain measures of
assets and off-farm income. Model A2 adds to model
A1 the set of farmer-specific variables. Model B2
contains both farmer-specific variables and plotspecific variables. The farm-level dataset contains
115 observations; the plot-level dataset contains 89
observations. Overall, the models predict farm-level
adoption patterns somewhat better than plot-level
adoption patterns, attaining an 86% success rate in
model A2.

4.1. Assets
Results from all reported models indicate that
after controlling other factors, hedgerow adoption
was more likely on large farms. These results are
consistent with previous Philippine research on soil
conservation adoption (de los Angeles, 1986). Results suggest that farm size may be a proxy for lower
risk exposure, fewer liquidity constraints, or improved access to resources. In elasticity terms, a 1%
increase in per-capita farm size is associated with a
0.15% increase in the probability of adoption at the
mean. In the farm-level regressions (models A1 and
A2), the probability of adoption is positively and
significantly correlated with the proportion of a
household's holdings that are securely held (either
formally or informally). This relationship is somewhat weaker in the plot level regressions (models B 1
and B2). In contrast, in the farm-level regressions
(models A1 and A2) the correlation between labor
availability and adoption is weak in the farm-level
regressions, but per hectare labor availability is positively correlated with hedgerow adoption at a 95%
confidence level in the plot-level regressions. Education of the household head exhibits a positive but
statistically weak correlation with adoption in all
models. The statistical weakness likely reflects the

7 The results of the pro bit models do not differ markedly from
those of logit models (in which disturbances are assumed to be
log-normally distributed).

fact that educational attainments in the sample were
uniformly low.
4.2. Off-farm income
Including measures of off-farm income presents
an econometric challenge because decisions regarding soil conservation investments and off-farm labor
supply are often simultaneously determined. The
possible endogeneity of off-farm income is a feature
that complicates efforts to include measures of offfarm income in any adoption study. Here, the null
hypothesis that off-farm income is exogenous to
adoption is tested, rather than assumed. The testing
method follows the procedure of Smith and Blundell
( 1986) for testing exogeneity in a Tobit regression.
Formally, the procedure consists of testing whether
c = 0 in the regression y =ax+ bm + cv + c:, where
y is the adoption variable, m is the off-farm income
variable, and v is the predicted residual from a
regression of m on a set of instrumental variables.
For this study, tests were conducted on both measures of off-farm income. Results suggest that only
the measure of per-capita wages strictly fails the test
of exogeneity. 8 Nevertheless, given the likely endogeneity of both measures of off-farm income, each
has been replaced by its instrumented value. The
regressions used for computing instruments are reported in Appendix B.
Regression results indicate that neither off-farm
income variable is correlated with adoption at standard significance levels. Nevertheless, the patterns
exhibited in the regressions help to explain previous
contradictions in empirical findings in two ways.
First, the probability of adoption is negatively correlated with non-agricultural, non-wage income. This
may reflect reduced interest in farming among
households with non-agricultural income, some of
whom had started small businesses that competed
with farming for capital investments. Second, households with wage income appear to have invested in
hedgerows at a higher rate than those without. Far

8 Specific t-statistics for the tests are as follows: for per-capita
non-agricultural, non-wage income: t = 1.31, and for per-capita
wage income: t = 2.11.

from indicating a tendency to invest wage earnings
in soil conservation, however, this more likely represents a greater reliance on annual crop income by
wage earners, who tended to have below-average
incomes.
4.3. Farmer characteristics
Membership in the local Baptist church and participation in agricultural training workshops run by
the church are highly correlated in the sample. Not
surprisingly, therefore, data indicate that households
identified as Baptist tended to adopt hedgerows at a
higher rate than their non-Baptist cohorts. Model A2
indicates that hedgerow adopters generally exhibit a
more favorable attitude toward hedgerows than nonadopters. While such a pattern might not itself be
surprising, what is surprising is that adding this
subjective measure does not diminish the explanatory power of farm-level characteristics. Model A2
also includes farmer estimates of the impact of
hedgerows on yields. On average, both adopters and
non-adopters judged hedgerows as relatively more
productive than traditional techniques. However, regression results indicate that adopters were likely to
judge them less favorably than non-adopters. This
pattern is unexpected, but may indicate that adopters
were more accurate in their estimate of impacts than
non-adopters (since lower com output was observed
on hedgerow plots).
4.4. Plot characteristics
The results of the plot-level regressions indicate
that adoption was less likely on large parcels than on
small parcels (model B2). This pattern is consistent
with research from Africa that shows large farms
tend to invest less per hectare in soil conservation
than small farms (e.g., Clay and Reardon, 1994).
However, causality could run the other way as well:
if parcels are large because soil quality is poor, then
the returns to soil conservation investments on large
parcels might be low, and therefore incentives to
adopt may be weaker than on smaller parcels.
The estimated coefficients on the land quality
variables are negative and significantly different from

G.E. Shively/ Agricultural Economics 17 (1997) 165-177

zero at a 95% confidence level. Parcels with greater
soil depth were less likely to receive investments in
soil conservation, and older parcels were also less
likely to receive investments. Since older parcels are
likely to have experienced greater cumulative soil
loss, these results suggest a nonlinear impact of land
quality on adoption. Farmers may postpone conservation on parcels that have remaining productive
potential, but refrain from investing on parcels that
are very old and, presumably, exhausted. Although a
conceptual link between parcel slope and cost of
adoption is clear, this explanation for lower adoption
rates on small farms is not fully borne out by the
data. In the regressions, greater slope is negatively
correlated with adoption, but not at statistically significant levels.
Finally, to assess whether the opportunity cost of
adopting hedgerows on a particular plot discouraged
adoption, a measure of the opportunity cost of adoption is included in model B2. The estimated coefficient is negative and significantly different from zero
at a 95% confidence level. This pattern indicates that
as the opportunity cost of adoption on a plot rises,
the probability of adoption falls. Greater consumption risk, as reflected by a higher opportunity cost of
soil conservation adoption on a plot, appears to be
negatively correlated with the probability of adopting
hedgerows. 9

5. Conclusions

This paper examined the respective roles of farm
characteristics and relative risk in explaining patterns
of soil conservation adoption by a group of low-income farmers in the Philippines. A conceptual model
based on a safety-first criterion was presented. The
model highlighted the importance of consumption

9 As a reviewer pointed out, a change in opportunity cost could
shift the distribution of profits and thereby lead to a change in the
level of production risk. Therefore, in some cases the proxy
measure of consumption risk used in the regressions could also be
picking-up the impact of higher production risk on adoption.
Obviously, an increase in either production risk or consumption
risk could discourage adoption.

risk in influencing adoption decisions. A reducedform model of hedgerow adoption was estimated
using probit analysis. Among the empirical findings
observed were that land- and labor-poor households
are less likely to invest in soil conservation. Larger
farm size, greater tenure security, and higher labor
availability were all correlated with higher probability of adoption on sample farms. Higher adoption
probability was also positively correlated with wage
income, but was negatively correlated with other
forms of off-farm income.
Factors that helped explain patterns of adoption at
the plot level include land quality and risk exposure.
Adoption was seen to be less likely when land
quality was high, or when plots were old. In the case
of risk exposure, results supported the main hypothesis tested in the paper, namely that after controlling
asset holdings, household characteristics, and subjective factors, consumption risk influences conservation adoption. As the consumption risk specific to
adoption increased, as measured here by the opportunity cost of conservation adoption on a plot, the
probability of adoption fell.
Focusing on the change in predicted probability of
hedgerow adoption associated with changes in available labor and land, the results show that individually, labor is relatively less important than land. This
pattern is consistent with the modest labor requirements for hedgerow establishment (e.g., 40 daysjha
compared with up to 500 days jha for bench terraces). In contrast, per-capita farm size was positively and significantly correlated with the probability of adoption. Larger farms, of course, have both
greater productive capacity and greater liquidity, both
of which translate into lower consumption risk.
From a policy perspective, these patterns underscore the importance of risk management in promoting soil conservation technologies to resource-constrained farmers. Future work should focus on three
related areas of research: first, investigating the extent to which risk considerations influence soil conservation decisions in other settings; second, assessing the degree to which specific soil conservation
strategies influence consumption risk; and third, separating the impact of adoption on consumption risk
from the possible impact of adoption on production
risk. A better understanding of these factors will
likely contribute to efforts directed at the twin goals

Appendix A. Subjective yield estimates and the
method of triangulation
A two-moment analysis was used to elicit subjective yield distributions based on the relative ease
with which a triangular distribution could be implemented empirically (Anderson et al., 1977; Pingali,
1982). During the survey, each decision maker was
asked to guess the most likely (m), lowest (a), and
highest (b) corn harvest he thought possible, with
and without soil conservation, on a specific parcel of
land. Parcels used for the estimates were subsequently measured, and the individual's yield estimates were computed for minimum, modal, and
maximum values under both scenarios. Probability
density functions were then estimated as:

Farmers tended to provide higher estimates for
mean yields and variances with hedgerows than
without hedgerows. Paired comparison tests between
adopters and non-adopters indicate that the difference between true and subjective estimates of means
were slightly higher for adopters and that the difference between true and subjective estimates of variances did not differ across farmer groups. This suggests that adopters tend to be somewhat more optimistic regarding hedgerows than non-adopters. An
alternative interpretation is that the measure serves
as a proxy for farmer skill: better farmers might have
a lower estimation error; hence, a ratio closer to the
true value, in this case, a approximately 0.90.
