ABSTRACT
Huang, J. and David, C.C., 1992. Demand for cereal grains in Asia: the effect of urbanization. Agric. Econ., 8: 107-124.
This paper analyzes the effects of urbanization on demand for cereal grains - rice,
wheat, and coarse grains - in nine Asian countries. A complete demand system (Almost
Ideal Demand System in linear form) is estimated in two stages based on aggregate time
series data from 1960 to 1988.
In the high-income countries, i.e. Japan and South Korea, urbanization was observed to
significantly reduce demand for cereal grains. In the lower-income countries, demand for
cereal grains either increased or remained the same with urbanization.
Among cereal grains, urbanization has had negative effects on demand for rice and
coarse grains, but consistently positive effects on demand for wheat. Only Japan and
Thailand among the countries studied have negative income elasticities of demand for total
cereal grains and for rice in particular. Hence, rice remains a necessity and a normal good
in most Asian countries.
Previous estimates of income elasticities of rice based on time-series aggregate data tend
to be lower than those based on cross-section household level data. When urbanization is
explicitly specified in the demand model, the estimates of income elasticities from time-series
data turn out to be consistent with those from cross-section data.

INTRODUCTION

Cereal grains account for two-thirds of the calorie intake in the average
Asian diet. Except in Pakistan, where wheat is the staple food, rice
continues to be the dominant staple grain, contributing 40-75% of total
calorie intake in most Asian countries. Significant quantities of wheat are

consumed in northern parts of China and India, while coarse grains such as
corn, barley and sorghum are important staples only in relatively small
parts of the Philippines, South Korea and Indonesia. Not only is rice the
major staple food, more than half of the rural labor force is engaged in rice
production and thus it is also the major source of livelihood in rural Asia
(Barker and Herdt, 1985). Because of the political importance of food
self-sufficiency and cheap food in Asia, the nature of future demand for
cereal grains, particularly of rice, is of major concern for policy formulation.
Although numerous studies of demand for cereal grains in Asia have
been undertaken, estimates of income elasticities have varied widely depending on the type of data used and the specification of the demand
model. For example, Table 1 shows that income elasticities of rice estimated from cross-section household data tend to be higher than those
based on aggregate time-series data. Indeed, the study by Ito, Peterson and
Grant (1989) using cross-country, time-series data in Asia indicates rela-

tively low and declining income elasticities over time, leading to the
conclusion that rice is becoming an inferior good. While these results have
been modified by Huang, David and Duff (1991) by correcting the methodological problems, there are at least two weaknesses with currently available estimates. First, the model specification ignores the theoretical restrictions of demand relationship, and secondly, the effect of structural changes
in the economy such as urbanization has not been explicitly specified.
In this paper, we examine whether and to what extent the rate of
urbanization affected the patterns of cereal grains consumption in Asia.
We estimate a complete demand system based on time-series (1960-1988)
aggregate data from nine major rice growing countries. These are
Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, Japan, South
Korea and Pakistan, which together account for about 85% of the world's
rice consumption and production.
CEREAL GRAIN CONSUMPTION IN ASIA

Table 2 summarizes the annual per-capita consumption of rice, wheat
and coarse grains in nine selected Asian countries over the past three
decades. Whereas rice consumption per capita decreased significantly in
three countries - Bangladesh, Japan and Thailand, wheat consumption per
capita increased significantly in nearly all countries. In fact, it was only in
China and Indonesia, and to a lesser extent the Philippines, where significant increases in per-capita rice consumption were experienced. In India,
South Korea and Pakistan, rice consumption per capita remained essen-

tially the same. While declining trends for Japan and even Thailand may be
expected because of relatively high per-capita income, this is somewhat
unexpected for Bangladesh, which has one of the lowest per-capita incomes
in Asia. On the other hand, consumption of per-capita coarse grains
decreased in most countries. The only exceptions are in Japan and the
Philippines, but this may be likely due to difficulties in identifying the use
of coarse grains between food and feed. Overall, Table 2 indicates that
over time, consumption of wheat increases relative to rice, and especially
coarse grains, where consumption per capita generally declined in absolute
terms. The increase in per-capita consumption of wheat was more substantial in China, Bangladesh, India and South Korea.
There is a common belief that wheat is substituted for rice as income
grows. However, cross-section household survey data (Table 3) indicate
that per-capita rice consumption is larger at higher-income levels in both
the urban and rural areas. On the other hand, per-capita rice consumption
in the urban sector is significantly lower than in the rural sector. This
pattern may have two explanations. First, demand for more conveniently
consumed food is greater in the urban areas where both spouses typically
work outside the home, travel time between work and home are large, and
cost of household help is higher than in the rural areas. Because wheat is
typically consumed in the form of commercially supplied bread and instant
noodles which can be easily purchased and consumed, it offers substantial
time savings for the household. Secondly, agricultural labor requires more
physical energy and thus calorie inputs than industrial work. At a given
income, rural consumers will have a greater demand for the cheaper food
per calorie, such as cereal grains, or even roots and tubers to maintain the
calorie requirements for subsistence. 1 Evidently, changes in the rate of
urbanization together with changes in relative prices and income will affect
consumption patterns of cereal grains in Asia.

include urbanization rate as an explanatory variable. The LA/ AIDS model
can be expressed as:

for

i,j=l, ... ,n

(1)

where w is the budget share, Y is expenditure or income, pj is commodity
price, i and j are commodity indices, at, f3t and "'j are parameters to be
estimated, and P is the price index defined as In P = ~i wi In PiÂ·
When using time-series data, equation (1) may be misspecified due to
omission of the effects of urbanization on consumption patterns between
total cereal grains and all other commodities, and among cereal grains. To
simplify the analysis, the parameters a* and {3 * in equation (1) are

112

J. HUANG AND C.C. DAVID

assumed to be linear functions of Z, where Z is a variable representing
urbanization. 2 This means that expansion of the urban sector in the
economy shifts the intercept and the slope of real income over time.
The impact of Z can then be specified with respect to equation (1) as:

wi = ai + a;z + ~/Yij ln Pj + (f3i

+ {3;Z) ln(YjP)

(2)

where a, a', {3, {3' and y are unknown parameters to be estimated.
Existence of shifts in parameters caused by urbanization may be tested by
examining whether or not a;= 0 and 13; = 0. Adding-up requires ~ a;= 0
and ~ 13; = 0.
To calculate the elasticities of income or expenditure (eiy), price (ei),
and urbanization (eiz), the following formulas are used: 3

eiy =

1 + (f3i + {3;Z)jwi- (f3i + {3;Z)jwi[ ~wk

ln Pk( eky-

1)]

(3)

eij= -oij+yijjwi-(f3i+{3;Z)jwi[wj+~wk ln pk(ekj+okj)]

(4)

eiz = Zjwi[ a;+ 13; ln(YjP) - f3;~wk ln pkekz]

(5)

where oij is the Kronecker delta. The incon:e and price elasticities for the
standard model, i.e. equation (1) without urbanization variables, can be
obtained by imposing 13; = 0 in equations (3) and (4), respectively. Similar
to the property of income elasticities or Engel Aggregation condition, the
sum of weighted urbanization elasticities for related commodities will be
zero, i.e., ~i wieiz = 0.

Estimation procedure and data
For empirical estimation, the following stochastic structure of equation
(2) is specified:

(6)
where t indexes time, and uit is the error term.
Considering the problem of data availability and the number of parameters to be estimated, the demand system was estimated in two stages. In the
first stage, commodities have been grouped broadly into two, namely cereal
grains, and non-cereal goods which include all other commodities besides
We assume that only a;* and {3;* but not Yii are affected by the urbanization variable Z to
avoid some econometric problems. However, this specification should not be considered as
too restrictive an assumption, since change in {3;* can reflect both changes in income and
price elasticities as we will see from the elasticity formulas presented later.
3 The elasticity formulas for LA/ AIDS model are derived based on the studies by Green
and Alston (1990) and Huang and David (1991).

cereal grains. Because the demand system expressed in budget share form
is singular, only one equation (total cereal grain demand) is estimated. If
serial correlation in the error terms is observed, the first-order autoregressive model or first-difference equation is used to estimate the total cereal
grain demand function for each country.
In the second stage, the model consists only of cereal grains disaggregated into rice, wheat and coarse grains. The composition of coarse grains
which included corn, barley, sorghum, rye, millet and other mixed grains
differed by country. The error term u; 1 in equation (6) is a random variable
satisfying the following conditions:

E(u; 1 ) = 0
E(uituit,)=f!ij
E(uituit')=O

for
for

t=t'

(7)

t=l=t'

If the Durbin-Watson test showed that the error terms in most of the
equations are serially correlated, the first-difference equation is estimated.
Iterative Seemingly Unrelated Regressions (SUR) or Iterative Zellner
Estimation procedures (IZE) (Zellner, 1962, 1963) are used directly or
after the variables have been transformed by the first difference. Several
authors including Kmenta and Gilbert (1968) and Christensen and Manser
(1977) have noted that the IZE procedure is equivalent to maximum
likelihood estimations of linear equations systems. 4
Data on consumption (availability) of cereal grains were obtained from
the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) which is based on
supply-utilization balance sheets in each country. 5 Because government
stocks and feed use of cereal grains are not reported for many countries in
the USDA data base, data on consumption of coarse grains are likely
overstated, which should be kept in mind when interpreting the results.
The ratio of urban to total population is from the United Nations. Data on

With both symmetry restrictions and iterative procedure, the estimation converges to full
information maximum likelihood methods. Because the former requires the use of information across equations, the variance and covariance play important roles in estimation, and
the latter converges to maximum likelihood method as stated above. Otherwise, the
Zellner's estimation procedure reduces to single equation ordinary least squares (OLS).
5 The alternative international source of cereal grain consumption data is the Food and
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). Both are mostly based on official
supply-utilization balance sheets from respective governments, but the U.S. Department of
Agriculture has made more modifications on official country statistics when these are
deemed unreliable or historically inconsistent (Paulino and Tseng, 1980). Although consumption data for the nine selected Asian countries are quite consistent between FAO and
USDA, we used the USDA data because FAO's published data refer to 3-year averages.

population and private consumption expenditures (PCE) are mainly from
the International Monetary Fund (IMF, various issues), Asian Development Bank (ADB, various issues) and World Bank (World Tables, various
issues), except for China which are taken from Beijing Review Press (1990).
To derive the aggregated price index of all cereal grains, the geometric
mean is calculated, using the consumer price index as proxy for the price of
non-cereal commodities. All price data are from various official country
sources including: Bangladesh Statistical Yearbook, India Directorate of
Economics and Statistics, Statistical Yearbook of Indonesia, Statistical
Yearbook of the Ministry of Agriculture (Japan), Economic Statistics
Yearbook of Korea, Yearbook of Agriculture and Forestry Statistics (Seoul),
25 years of Pakistan in 1947-72 and Pakistan Statistical Yearbook, Bureau
of Agricultural Statistics and Central Bank of the Philippines, and China
State Statistical Bureau.
RESULTS

Demand systems are estimated with the imposition of homogeneity and
symmetry conditions suggested by demand theory. Tests of demand restrictions are satisfied when urbanization effects are specified but generally
rejected in the standard model where urbanization is omitted. The estimation results of the first-stage model as well as the implied demand elasticities of total cereal grains are reported and discussed briefly in Appendix 1.
Table 4 shows the estimation results of the second-stage cereal grain
demand model. 6 The statistical results are remarkably good with most of
the coefficients having the expected signs and reasonable magnitudes. The
goodness of fit measured by R 2 is generally high except for wheat in China.
The low R 2 for China may be due to the prevalence of quantitative
rationing so that income, prices and urbanization alone do not fully explain
consumption levels of these commodities.
The coefficients of rice price tend to be more statistically significant than
those for wheat and coarse grains. Given the predominant role of rice in
the Asian diet, changes in the price of rice will significantly affect the
budget shares of all cereal grains. The generally insignificant coefficients of
real cereal expenditure indicate that the budget share of individual cereal
grains is not sensitive to changes in the total cereal expenditures, but
To obtain all the relevant statistical information for all three equations without encountering singularity problem, two alternative pair-wise demand equations are estimated, i.e.
ricejwheat and then ricejcoarse grains. The results show that estimations are invariant to
the equation that is dropped. To simplify Table 4, only rice and wheat demand equations
are reported.

consumption may be significantly affected by those changes. This is because of the simultaneous effects of total cereal expenditure and price on
the relative budget share (wi = piqJY). For example, holding price constant, the consumption level (q) will increase (decrease) by the same
proportion as income (Y), leaving the budget share (w) unchanged.
To examine the existence of urbanization effect, Table 5 reports the
results of the Wald chi-square tests which showed that urbanization shifted
the intercepts in five out of nine Asian countries at the 5% significance
level, i.e., Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Pakistan and Thailand. Except in
Thailand, the slopes of real total cereal expenditure have also significantly
changed in these countries. The overall Wald tests indicate that urbanization has had a significant impact in seven (i.e. Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Pakistan and Thailand) out of nine countries. The
insignificant result in China may be due firstly to the slow rate of urbanization over the period of study as interregional migration was highly restricted; and secondly, to the system of grain rationing that limited consumer choices. In the Philippine case, the insignificant coefficient of the
urbanization ratio may be due to the relatively higher correlation between
the real income and urbanization which increased the variances of estimates more than in other countries.

a Total expenditure elasticities of rice, wheat and coarse grains are the product of total
cereal expenditure elasticity obtained from stage I and cereal expenditure elasticity from
stage II. IFPRI's estimates (1976) on total cereal expenditure elasticities are used for
Bangladesh (0.48), India (0.47), and Pakistan (0.23).

c Elasticities are calculated for those countries where the estimated parameters are statistically significant.

elasticities have the correct signs. The generally higher absolute values of
uncompensated own-price elasticities for rice compared to wheat and
coarse grains would largely reflect the greater income effects of a price

change in rice which dominates total cereal expenditure in most of the
countries.
Several patterns may be observed with respect to the total expenditure
elasticities for individual grains. The total expenditure elasticity for rice
remains positive ranging from 0.25 (Philippines) to 0.53 (India) in seven out
of the nine Asian countries. The negative total expenditure elasticity of
demand for rice in Japan, which has one of the world's highest per-capita
incomes, is to be expected. The negative elasticity for Thailand is also
plausible as the country now has the highest per-capita income among
South and Southeast Asia. The relatively high elasticity for South Korea is
due partly to the fact that shifts in consumption from barley to rice have
occurred as income increased and partly to the overestimate of total
expenditure elasticity of demand for total cereal grains in the first stage of
this study.
The total expenditure elasticities for wheat are positive in all countries
except for Japan. However, wheat does not appear to be preferred over
rice as evidenced by the lower total expenditure elasticity for wheat
compared to rice in India, Indonesia, Pakistan and the Philippines. Japan is
the only country where all cereal grains are regarded as inferior goods, but
the absolute values of the expenditure elasticities are relatively low.
It should be noted that estimated total expenditure elasticities of demand for coarse grains may be overstated because of underestimation of
feed use, which lead to overestimation of food consumption in the data
used.
Urbanization elasticities

The elasticity of urbanization is defined as the percentage change in
demand due to a percentage change in the ratio of urban to total population. Consistent with expectations, urbanization has generally negative
effects on consumption of rice and coarse grains, but positive effects on
wheat consumption.
Japan has the most negative urbanization elasticity (- 0.34) of demand
for rice, which implies that omission of urbanization variable in the
specification of cereal grain demand models for Japan will lead to a
downward bias in estimated income or expenditure elasticity. The highly
negative urbanization elasticity (- 0.24) in India, which is next only to
Japan, can partly explain why per-capita rice consumption in India remained relatively unchanged over the last three decades. Likewise, the
decrease in per-capita rice consumption by 28 kg in Bangladesh despite the
relatively high expenditure elasticity during the last three decades may
partly be explained by the negative effects of urbanization on rice demand

120

in this country. 7 The urbanization elasticity of rice in Pakistan is also
negative but small in magnitude because rice is not a staple food in this
country. Moreover, unlike in other Asian countries, wheat is not generally
consumed as commercial breads, and therefore is not necessarily more
convenient to consume than rice. Thailand also has a negative elasticity,
but the magnitude is unexpectedly low. The positive urbanization elasticities in South Korea is unexpected and may imply that the substitution of
rice for barley occurred not only because of higher income but also because
of the higher rate of urbanization.
In contrast to rice and coarse grains, urbanization elasticities for wheat
are all positive with relatively high absolute values. Therefore, observed
growth in wheat consumption over time in all countries is due not only to
increases in income but also to the growing urbanization. Because wheat is
the staple food in Pakistan, the urbanization elasticity is relatively small
(0.29). The low elasticity obtained for South Korea (0.27) is explained by
the different nature of substitution among cereal grains in this country.
Whereas wheat is typically substituted for rice as urbanization increases,
the substitution of rice for barley was also important in this country during
this period. In general, countries with small initial budget shares of wheat
have higher urbanization elasticities.
For coarse grains, urbanization had negative effects on consumption in
all countries studied. The negative signs are due to the fact that wheat as
well as rice are generally more accessible and convenient to consume than
coarse grains. Omission of urbanization variables in the analysis of demand
for rice, wheat and coarse grains may therefore tend to underestimate
income or expenditure elasticities for rice and coarse grains while overestimating them for wheat.
As shown in Table 1, estimates of income elasticities based on cross-section data are generally significantly higher than those based on time-series
aggregate data. Even when the estimation problems in IPG's time-series
analysis which lead to downward bias in estimated income elasticity have
been corrected by HDD, estimates in the last column are still below those
from cross-section data. All of these time-series estimates, however, are
based on single equation models that specify only income and relative
prices as independent variables. When urbanization and interdependence
of rice and all other commodities in the economy are accounted for in the

Aside from the effects of urbanization, production shifts from rice to wheat may have
increased home consumption of wheat grains over the last three decades in Bangladesh.
This follows from Bouis (1990) hypothesis that greater commercialization of a cereal grain
will tend to reduce its consumption.

analysis as done in this paper, estimates of income elasticities based on
time series become remarkably consistent with estimates from cross section
data. For example, our expenditure elasticity of demand for rice in
Bangladesh is 0.38, which is close to the cross-section estimate by Bouis
(0.34-0.83) and much higher than time-series estimates by IPG (- 0.04)
and HDD (0.08). Similarly, time-series estimates of expenditure elasticities
of demand for rice in this study are quite comparable with those estimated
by cross-section data in China, India, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea,
Pakistan, Philippines and Thailand. The omission of urbanization variable
which is typically positively correlated with income, therefore, leads to
underestimation of income elasticity in time-series analysis.
CONCLUSIONS

Urbanization has significantly affected patterns of Asian cereal grains
consumption. Its effects on total cereal grains may differ by country
according to income levels. In high-income countries, it has been observed
that urbanization significantly increased the consumption of other noncereal goods and decreased cereal grains consumption, whereas urbanization increased cereal grain consumption in low-income countries.
Among cereal grains, urbanization has had negative effects on consumption of rice and coarse grains but positive effects on wheat consumption.
The positive effects of urbanization on demand for wheat are consistently
observed for all countries because of the greater convenience of consuming
wheat products. Therefore, continuing increases in wheat consumption
over time are due not only to increases in income, but also due to those
urbanization effects. Among the countries studied, only Japan and Thailand have negative income elasticities of demand for total cereal grains.
Rice remains a necessity and a normal good in all countries except these
countries.
A review of the existing studies of rice demand in Asia reveals that
time-series data tend to generate lower estimates of rice income elasticities
than cross-section data. This study has shown that when the effects of
urbanization are taken into account, estimates of income elasticities for
rice based on time-series data become consistent with those from cross-section data. In order to improve projections of future demand for cereal
grains, therefore, changes in the rate of urbanization as well as income
must be taken into account.

APPENDIX 1

Appendix Table 1 presents the estimation results of the first-stage model
as well as the implied demand elasticities for total cereal grains. Bangladesh
and Pakistan as well as India have been excluded from the first-stage
analysis because of unreliable data on private consumption expenditure in
the 1960s when the former two countries were not yet separated, and lack
of data for the latter. With the exception of Japan and Thailand, the total
expenditure elasticities of demand for cereal grains are positive. Indonesia
has the highest expenditure elasticities of total cereal grains (0.51), followed by South Korea (0.50) and China (0.41).
Urbanization effect is still in favor of cereal grains consumption in some
low-income countries such as China and the Philippines. This may be due
to the high substitutability of cereal grains for inferior root crops such as
sweet potatoes and cassava. On the other hand, urbanization reduces
cereal grains consumption in those countries where income levels are high
such as Japan and South Korea. This suggests that urbanization induces
substitution between cereals and other food such as animal products. The
effects of urbanization on total cereal grain consumption are insignificant
in India, Indonesia and Thailand.
