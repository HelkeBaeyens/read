Abstract
This paper considers the impact of 'food scares', predominately concerns relating to BSE, on UK beef prices at retail,
wholesale and producer levels over the 1990s. Acknowledging the co-movement that exists between prices in the meat
marketing chain, we use a co-integrating framework, the results of which show the importance of publicity regarding the
safety of food in the transmission of beef prices in the UK. The 'food publicity' index that we use has a marked negative
impact on the prices at all levels, a result that is consistent with the effect of an inward shift in the demand function. Moreover,
the extent of price decline varies between the marketing stages entailing that the price spreads rise in response to an increase
in the (negative) publicity about food safety. While not a formal test of market power, these observations are consistent with
recent theoretical results demonstrating that market power exacerbates price changes in the upstream sectors for a given change
in the retail demand function. The implication of these varying price changes is that the food safety concerns also cause the
marketing margins between the stages to widen. The UK's Competition Commission has recently investigated the abuse of
market power in the food sector, inspired largely by this specific issue.© 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction

In recent years, issues relating to food safety have
risen to the top of the political agenda in many countries, particularly in Europe and North America. Much
of this agenda has related to the increased awareness
over health, changing dietary patterns and the differences in standards between the countries that lie at the
heart of trade disputes. However, perhaps the most notable feature of the increased public reaction to food
safety is the issue of 'food scares'. This is particularly

the case in Europe, and is exemplified by the outbreak
of BSE in the UK, which according to estimates (DTZ
Pieda Consulting, 1998) saw beef consumption fall
temporarily by 40%, not only in the UK itself, but also
in countries such as Germany and Italy which had no
reported cases of BSE (at the time).
To some extent, the academic literature has responded by paying greater attention to food safety
concerns. This has essentially focused on two themes.
The first has been to re-visit food demand studies taking into account health-driven changes in dietary patterns. Examples include Brown and Schrader (1990),
Burton and Young (1996), Kinnucan et al. (1997) and
Rickertsen and von Cramon-Taubadel (2000) among
others. The other main theme in the food safety

literature has been to focus on the appropriate regulatory structure for dealing with food safety concerns
(see, for example, the symposia published in the American Journal of Agricultural Economics, December
1997). However, to the best of our knowledge, the literature has not addressed the impact of food scares on
the prices at different stages of the marketing chain.
This is the focus of the present paper which studies
the nature of price adjustment in the UK beef market
in response to the outbreak, increased awareness and
likely effects of BSE. An important feature of the paper is that we consider price adjustment at three stages
(retail, wholesale and producer) of the beef marketing chain. By doing so, we highlight not only the
impact of price adjustment but also the effect of food
scares on price spreads. Our data show that prices
have fallen at all levels in the 1990s but that spreads
have not remained constant. Specifically, whereas
retail prices have fallen by 18%, wholesale and producer prices have fallen by around 40% each. During
this period all spreads have been observed to grow,
but the retail-wholesale spread has grown five times
more than the wholesale-producer spread. While this
price decline is unsurprising in the face of heightened
consumer awareness, the change in spreads is perhaps
less obvious. However, as McCorriston et al. (1998)
show, this result is consistent with the outcome of
the model of vertical markets in which a shock to
retail demand passes through a chain characterised
by a price transmission elasticity that is greater than
unity. The value of the elasticity depends on a host of
factors, one of which is the degree of market power.
In this paper, we present casual observations of
the data before exploring econometrically the relationships between prices along the UK's meat chain,
which are shown to be dependent on the publicity
given to issues of food safety. To incorporate this empirically, we employ a newly developed measure, the
'food publicity' index.
The nature and timing of this research is apt. There
has been debate in the UK relating to the (casual)
observation that price changes at the retail stage were
smaller than those occurring at the farm level. This
was a principal motivation for the recent Competition
Commission inquiry, which among the other things
investigated the market power in the UK food sector
with a particular emphasis on the vertical relationships. While we present no formal model of the market

structure in this paper, McCorriston et al. (1998, 1999)
have shown that when the markets are imperfectly
competitive, price adjustment will vary between the
sectors.
Both demand and supply effects are likely to have
influenced the pattern of price changes in the beef sector over the 1990s. Most obviously, the BSE crisis is
likely to have caused shifts in the retail demand function for beef, which will have had an impact on the
upstream prices. However, the cost side effects may
also be pertinent given new meat sector regulations.
These have been introduced to reassure consumers of
the safety of British beef in the aftermath of the crisis and are likely to have increased costs. For example, higher charges for the Meat Hygiene Service and
Specified Risk Material (SRM) disposal, reduced subsidies for rendering and increased transactions costs
are widely held to have arisen from the BSE crisis
(Meat and Livestock Commission, 1999). Costs have
also increased due to the greater use of Controlled Atmosphere Packaging (CAP). However, in the absence
of reliable estimates the impact of these changes is difficult to verify, not least because partial compensation
was received by many of those affected. 1 Clearly, in
considering the impact of food scares on the UK beef
sector, there are likely to be both demand and supply
factors determining prices at each vertical stage. However, as discussed in the following section, it should
not necessarily be expected that these exogenous factors should have a symmetric impact on prices (and
hence price spreads) throughout the marketing chain.
More specifically, while the rising costs due to tighter
regulatory standards will lead to a decrease in price
spreads, the shift of the retail demand function will
lead to an increase in price spreads. Moreover, even if
the shift factors are equi-proportionate, these effects
will not cancel out, with the retail demand shifts dominating the impact of the regulatory standards.
The paper is organised as follows. In Section 2,
we briefly survey both the theoretical and empirical
literature relating to price adjustment in the vertically
related markets. This suggests that even though the
prices change in the same direction, the extent of the
price changes vary according to the retail stage and
hence marketing margins will change. In the case

studied here, marketing margins are expected to increase even if the marketing costs and the retail
demand curve shift to the same extent. This notwithstanding, the nature of the data relating to food scares
would suggest that demand shifts are likely to dominate. Section 3 presents the data and in Section 4
we discuss the framework for the empirical analysis.
Acknowledging the co-movement of beef prices at all
stages of the chain, we adopt a co-integration framework for the empirical analysis, the results of which
are reported in Section 5. These show that beef prices
do not co-integrate without the inclusion of a measure
of food safety publicity - the food publicity index.
The negative impact of the index differs according to
the marketing level and may account for the growing
price spreads observed empirically. Section 6 concludes by highlighting issues relating to the on-going
research.

2. Price adjustment: theoretical
and empirical issues
2.1. Theoretical issues
In the agricultural economics literature, the most
popular framework for considering the impact of exogenous shocks to the food sector is in the context
of the equilibrium displacement models originating
with Gardner (1975). The basis of this framework
is to consider the impact of price adjustment (and
corresponding welfare effects) at different stages of
the marketing chain and how the farm-retail spread
may change as a consequence. An important feature
of the Gardner framework relates to the source of
the exogenous shocks. In particular, a demand-side
shock directly affecting, say, the retail sector, may
have a different effect on retail and farm prices than
a supply-side shock originating at the farm sector.
However, one important criticism of the standard
equilibrium displacement framework is that it assumes
that the downstream food market is perfectly competitive. There is increasing evidence that this is not an
appropriate characterisation of the food sector in many
developed countries. For example, Bhuyan and Lopez
(1997) measure market power across 40 sub-sectors
of the US food industry and find that in all but three
cases, the null hypothesis of competitive behaviour

349

can be rejected. Although studies of the food sector in
other developed countries are generally lacking, high
levels of concentration at least suggest that similar
phenomena characterise the food sector in most European countries. Moreover, the recent investigation by
the UK Competition Commission clearly reinforces
the suspicion that market power is a feature of the food
sector in the UK.
What difference does this make to our understanding of price adjustment? A number of studies from
the industrial organisation literature have shown that
imperfect competition has a considerable impact on
price adjustment. Specifically, under 'reasonable' conditions, for a supply shock, price transmission is reduced if the downstream sector is characterised by
market power. Recently, McCorriston et al. (1998) introduce market power into the Gardner framework;
they show that for an increase in costs at the farm
level, market power in the downstream food sector will
reduce the level of price adjustment compared with
the competitive benchmark. The implication is that in
the presence of a supply shock at the farm level, the
model predicts a narrowing of price spreads. The same
holds true for a shift in the marketing services supply
function which captures the increase in costs due to
tighter regulatory standards. Under imperfect competition, an increase in the input costs causes retail prices
to rise but this increase is proportionately less than the
increase in input costs. Consequently, price spreads
should narrow where processing costs increase.
However, this still leaves open the issue of the
source of the exogenous shock. As highlighted above,
distinguishing between a demand and cost shock matters. McCorriston et al. (1999) also consider this issue
and label price adjustment due to a demand shock affecting the retail sector as a 'pass-back' effect. They
show formally that for an inward shift in the demand
function, market power in the downstream food sector
will increase the magnitude of the price changes occurring upstream compared to the competitive benchmark. In other words, price changes at the farm level
will be greater than those occurring at the retail level
for a given shift in the retail demand function. The
implication is that price spreads should widen following such a demand shock. Given that the meat sector
was likely to be subject to both sources of exogenous
change over the 1990s, the impact on prices at each
vertical stage (and, by extension, the development of

350

T Lloyd et al. I Agricultural Economics 25 (2001) 347-357

price spreads) will be the net outcome of both sources
of exogenous shocks to the beef sector. Moreover,
even if marketing costs and the demand curve shifted
by equal amounts, the shift in the retail demand function should dominate the impact of the rise in the costs
associated with tighter regulatory standards. Thus,
unless the extent of marketing cost increases was
significantly greater than the direct effect of the food
scares (which is unlikely to be the case), a priori we
should expect to observe a widening of price spreads
over this period in the presence of market power.

2.2. Empirical issues
A growing number of studies focus on the empirical aspects of price adjustment in the agricultural and
related markets. Owing to the apparent co-movement
in prices, many of these recent studies apply a
co-integration methodology since it, (a) accounts appropriately for the time-series properties of the data
and, (b) measures the short-run and long-run nature
of price adjustment. Examples of such studies include
von Cramon-Taubadel (1998), Chang and Griffith
(1998) and Goodwin and Holt (1999) among others.
The latter two papers differ from the earlier literature
in that they focus on multiple stages of the marketing
chain by separately identifying price adjustment at
the farm, wholesale and retail levels, a practice that is
also followed in this paper. However, in most cases,
these empirical studies confine the sources of price
adjustment to be 'within' the food chain. Exogenous influences, apart from a time trend or a given
structural break, are not accounted for.
In summary, investigating the impact of food scares,
it is important to recognise that this type of exogenous
shock represents primarily a demand-side shift to the
food sector. As a result, it is reasonable to expect price
adjustment in the upstream stages of the marketing
chain. However, the extent of these price changes will
vary between the stages if the downstream sectors
are characterised by imperfect competition. Although
the analysis of price adjustment is not a formal test
of market power, higher levels of price adjustment in
the upstream stages are certainly consistent with it.
If the extent of price changes between each marketing stage varies, this implies that the price spreads
(or marketing margin) will also change. Where
prices are non-stationary and potentially exhibit

co-movement, a co-integration framework offers an
appropriate methodology for considering the extent of
price adjustment. The data and the role of food scares
on the beef market are outlined in the next section.

3. Data issues and 'food scares'
We employ real beef prices at the producer, wholesaler and retailer level (P1 , W1 and R 1 , respectively)
in England and Wales. The data have been calculated
by the Meat and Livestock Commission and represent
carcass weight equivalents (CWE) to facilitate direct
comparison of prices at all the three stages. The data
are monthly and cover the period from January 1990
to December 1998 (see Figs. 1 and 2). 2 They are deflated by the Retail Price Index (January 1999 base)
and clearly show a declining trend over the period.
Retail prices fell by 60 pence/kg, wholesale prices by
69 pence/kg and producer prices by 75 pence/kg over
the period. Casual inspection of Fig. 1 also reveals that
prices have a tendency to co-move, in that price movements at one level of the chain seem to be reflected in
prices elsewhere in the chain.
These price series are supplemented by a 'food
publicity index', which is a count of the number of articles printed in broad-sheet newspapers on a monthly
basis that relate to the safety of meat. In general,
these reports are negative in nature and reflect the
concerns regarding the safety of meat, in terms of its
production and processing. Articles relating to BSE
dominate the index although other similar topics such
as health standards in abattoirs are also covered. The
index reflects consumer concerns regarding the safety
aspects of meat consumption and also the impact of
regulation on the suppliers of meat. Consequently, the
index will be correlated with the developments that
affect both the demand and supply of beef, though it
is likely to be the food scares issue that dominates
given the public furore over BSE. In the empirical
analysis, the natural log of this index (denoted it) is
used. A plot of the series is shown in Fig. 3. Augmented Dickey-Fuller tests indicate that each price
series and i1 are integrated of order 1 [/(1)], as visual
inspection of Figs. 1 and 3 suggests.

4. Methodology

Table I
Co-integration test results

The formal analysis is conducted in a vector autoregressive (VAR) framework to exploit the properties
of integration and co-integration that may exist in the
data. VAR methods offer a tractable framework for the
investigation of dynamic relations, particularly when
the variables are co-integrated. Consider a VAR(k)
model,

Ho

Xt

=

IT!Xt-1

+ · · · + ITkXt-k + e1
et "'n.i.d.(O, I;)

(1)

where Xt is a (n x 1) vector of I(l) variables, each IT;
(i = 1, ... , k) is an (n x n) matrix of coefficients to
be estimated using a (t = 1, ... , T) sample of data
and et is a (n x 1) vector of errors with a non-diagonal
covariance matrix. The order (k) of the VAR is also
determined by the data, and here we adopt the Schwarz
Information Criterion (SIC) for this purpose.
Co-integration is evaluated using methods developed by Johansen (1988). Following Stock and
Watson (1988), it is well known that with n variables
there can be at the most n - l co-integrating relations
and n - r common trends in the system. Therefore,
with a triplet of prices, there can be at the most two
such co-integrating combinations, since if any two
pairs of prices co-move (co-integrate) then so must the
third. In this case, the prices share a single common
trend and may be expected to co-move over time.
Given the difficulties that can be encountered interpreting the coefficients of multiple co-integrating vectors (Ltitkepohl and Reimers, 1992) impulse response
functions are commonly calculated to evaluate the time
path of the variables in x 1 to exogenous shocks in such
~ircu~stances. The simulated time paths are found by
1mposmg a recursive structure on the moving average representation of the VAR and represent the time
path of the variable i with respect to a unit shock to
the variable j, s periods ago, all other variables at the
time of the shock (and earlier) held constant. Since our
principal interest is in the effect of health information
on prices, orthogonalised impulses are adopted here
given that in the current application changes in the
food publicity index are likely to drive price changes
and not vice versa. Given that prices at all stages of
the marketing chain may respond in unison to such
shocks, this orthogonalisation is advantageous since

5. Results
As an initial step, Eq. (1) is estimated for the price
triplet (Rt. W1 and P 1 ). An unrestricted VAR(l2)
model, augmented by four impulse dummy variables 3
gives a good approximation, such that residuals conform to the stated assumptions of e 1 in (1).
Given that prices are /(1), the model is examined
for the presence of co-integration implied by the
co-movement of prices apparent in Fig. l. Panel (a)
of Table 1 reports the co-integration test statistics for
this model.
Whilst there appears to be an indication of
co-integration amongst the triplet, the formal evidence
is at the best weak. Specifically, the trace test statistic
rejects the null hypothesis of no co-integration at the
5% significance, but the maximal eigenvalue test does
not. In addition, the test statistics do not provide any
substantive evidence of the multiple co-integrating relationships suggested by the pair-wise co-movement
of the data. One literal interpretation of this result is
that the beef markets are poorly integrated. Alternatively, the explanation might lie in the role of omitted
variables, in particular, given the preceding discus3 Dummies are for 1993(3), 1995(9), 1996(3) and 1996(4). Whilst
they have a negligible impact on parameter estimates, they are
included to satisfy the normality assumption.

sion, the impact of BSE and related health concerns
on price movements.
Augmenting the price transmission model with (the
natural logarithm of) the food publicity index it has a
marked effect on inference. As the results in Panel (b)
of Table 1 show, evidence in favour of co-integration is
now much stronger: the trace and maximal eigenvalue
test statistics now reject the null of no co-integration at
the 1% significance level. Moreover, both tests suggest
the presence of three co-integrating vectors, a result
consistent with pair-wise co-movement (in combination with the food scares variable). 4 The clear conclusion of the co-integration analysis is that the food
publicity index plays a key role in the long-run evolution of the UK beef prices and that once the effect
of the index is taken into account, prices co-move in
a manner consistent with market integration.
The above result begs a number of questions, not
least those relating to the precise role that the food
publicity index plays in price formation. To investigate
this issue, Fig. 4 shows the orthogonalised impulse
response functions of the three beef prices to a unit
( 1%) shock in the food publicity index. These indicate
that the heightened publicity regarding food safety initially increases beef prices at all stages of the marketing chain, but that thereafter, they fall. The long-run
effect is negative on all beef prices, with the estimates
suggesting that retail, wholesale and producer prices
fall by 1.70, 2.25 and 3.0 pence/kg, respectively. This
corresponds to a food publicity elasticity of around
1.4. 5
As an adjunct to these results, forecast error decompositions may also be calculated. These estimate the
proportion of the total variance of each of the prices
that is due to an orthogonalised shock measured at specific intervals following this shock (Hamilton, 1994 ).
The results suggest that the effects on prices stabilise
some 30 months following a shock to the index which
accounts for approximately 6, 11 and 61% of the variation in the retail, wholesale and producer prices, respectively.
4 Using the finite sample correction to the asymptotic critical
values suggested by Reimers (1992) does not change this conclusion, although the P-values of the test are conespondingly larger.
Specifically, whilst the null of no cointegration cannot be rejected
at the 10% level in panel (a), it is rejected in panel (b) at tbis level.
5 At mean values, the food scares elasticities are 1.27, 1.60 and
1.12, respectively.

The results demonstrate two features: (1) That the
UK beef prices were responsive to the public's awareness of food safety issues (principally BSE) in the
1990s but (2) that the impact was not common across
stages in the marketing chain. This second point suggests that price spreads also move systematically in response to publicity about the safety of food. Shocks to
the food publicity index cause the wholesale-producer
price spreads to expand more than the retail-wholesale
price spreads. Moreover, the difference between retail and producer prices, the measure that receives
most attention in the public debate on this issue, rises
by an even larger amount in response to BSE publicity. Specifically, a 1% increase in the food publicity index induces a 0.5 pence/kg increase in the
retail-wholesale spread, 0.75 pence/kg increase in the
wholesale-producer spread and thus a 1.25 pence/kg
increase in the retail-producer spread. Given that the
media interest has generally risen over the sample period, price spreads are observed to rise over time.
The observation that the food publicity index should
lead to decline in prices at each marketing stage is, to
a large degree, expected and consistent with the dominance of the demand relative to supply sources (i.e.
due to increased regulation) of exogenous shocks in
the beef sector over the 1990s. That this price decline
should vary between stages is a little more surprising,
particularly given the nature of the data which, being
consistent with fixed proportions technology, might
otherwise suggest that all the price declines be equal.
The fact that these price declines vary between stages,
leading to a widening of price spreads, is indicative of
a food chain characterised by some degree of market
power at wholesale and retail stages.

6. Conclusions
This paper has focussed on the impact of publicity, predominately concerns relating to BSE, on
price transmission in the UK beef sector during the
1990s. Acknowledging the co-movement that exists
between prices in the meat marketing chain, we use a
co-integrating framework, the results of which show
the importance of information, as embodied in a
food publicity index, in price transmission. Prices at
all levels have tended to decrease during the 1990s,
a result that is consistent with inward shifts of the

demand function. Perhaps more interesting is that the
extent of price adjustment varies between marketing
stages. In particular, prices at the retail (wholesale)
level decline but less so than prices at the wholesale
(farm) level. While supply side shocks may also have
been apparent in the UK beef sector over the 1990s
due to increased regulation, the fact that widening
margins are observed suggests the dominance of
demand-side shifts in a market that does not correspond to a perfectly competitive model. Although
the results presented in this paper do not constitute a
formal test of market power, they lend support to the
UK's Competition Commission investigation into the
degree of market power in the food sector. A more
formal test for market power in vertically integrated
markets is the subject of our on-going research.
