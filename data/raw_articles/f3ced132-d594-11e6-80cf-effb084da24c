Abstract
The recent rural reforms in China have had great effects on agricultural production and productivity as well as
rural household consumption. While much has been written on production and productivity effects of these reforms,
very few Chinese studies have attempted to analyze the changes in rural consumption patterns. This paper uses a
dynamic AIDS model to estimate various food demand parameters for Chinese rural households using rural
household survey data recently released by the China State Statistical Bureau. The results show that all important
food commodities including rice, wheat, coarse grains, vegetables, meat, tobacco and alcohol have positive
expenditure elasticities. Rice, wheat and coarse grains are necessities, while meat, vegetables, alcohol and tobacco
are luxuries. The expenditure elasticities for rice, coarse grains and tobacco are declining, but those for wheat, meat,
vegetables and alcohol are increasing. As per capita income rises and population increases, the demand for these
items will continue to increase. Therefore, China must continue to increase its food production by a greater rate in
the future in order to avoid food shortages.

After 30 years of socialist revolution, China
initiated in 1979 its well known rural reforms,
which transformed agricultural production from
central planning to a market-driven system. These
reforms have had significant effects on agricultural production and productivity as well as rural
household food demand in China. While much
has been written on the production and productivity effects of the rural reforms, very few Chinese studies have attempted to analyze in detail

rural household consumption behavior during this
reform period. 1 Following rapid growth of per
capita incomes, the importance of grains and
low-quality vegetables in the Chinese rural diet
diminished substantially and was supplemented
with increased meat intake, a diverse array of
fruits and high-quality vegetables and a distinct
preference for higher-quality alcohol and tobacco. China has 23% of the world's population

with rural residents accounting for more than
70% of the national total population. Thus,
changes in the consumption pattern of China's
rural population can have substantial effects on
both domestic and international trade, particularly on food and agricultural trade. Knowledge
of rural household food demand behavior, and
the effects of current and future reforms on food
consumption patterns provides important information for policy makers in redesigning and evaluating policy options.
Several studies on Chinese household consumption (including rural households) have been
conducted previously. Linear expenditure systems
were applied for rural households in Hubei
province and urban households in Beijing for
1981 and 1982 (Van der Gaag, 1984; Li, Yang
and He, 1985). Lewis and Andrews (1989) also
employed a linear expenditure system to estimate
urban and rural household demand in China. The
small number of observations available for these
former studies limited the applicability of the
results. This study differs from the previous ones
in several aspects. Firstly, we use provincial aggregate time-series data from rural household
surveys for a relatively long-term period from
1982 to 1990. These data were collected by the
General Organization for Rural Household Surveys of the State Statistical Bureau. This data set
provides more observations and more variation
for each variable, plus it enables us to observe
changes in consumption patterns over time. Secondly, a more flexible demand system, namely the
almost ideal demand system (AIDS), is employed
to estimate food demand in rural China. Thirdly,
the dynamic nature of food consumption for the
rural households is considered in the model. During the period of analysis (1982-1990), per capita
incomes as well as consumption patterns have
changed dramatically. As demand parameters may
have changed, the model used to analyze these
parameters must be dynamic.
The paper is organized as follows. The first
section of the paper reviews general food consumption patterns and their changes over time in
rural China. Section 2 introduces a general
framework (model) which is suitable for analyzing
food consumption patterns in China. The third

section discusses the data sources and the
methodology in constructing variables for food
demand estimation. We empirically estimate the
demand system for rural households and discuss
estimated expenditure and price elasticities in the
fourth section. Finally, we discuss some policy
implications of this study.

1. Food consumption patterns in rural China

In this part of the paper, we discuss the general trend of food consumption patterns in rural
China. We give special attention to the effects of
the rural reforms on the changes in food consumption. However, the rural reforms do not
have a significant direct effect on rural consumption. They affect consumption patterns indirectly
through income and relative price changes. Per
capita income has increased substantially since
1978 due to the reforms. Average per capita
income increased only by 2.4% per annum in real
terms from 1957 to 1978, but then it accelerated
to 7.1% per annum from 1978 to 1990. The
relative prices have also changed significantly
since the reforms were introduced. The retail
price index increased by 0.5% per annum from
1957 to 1978, while it increased by 6.3% per
annum from 1978 to 1990. Among all consumption goods, food prices increased the most rapidly
since the reforms, at a rate of 8.1% per annum,
while clothing prices increased the least, at 3.3%
per year. Fuel and other commodity price increases fall between the above two groups, at
5.5% and 3.9% per annum, respectively.
Table 1 shows the long-term basic trends in
rural household expenditures in China. The proportion of food expenditures to total expenditures declined steadily from 65.9% in 1957 to
54.9% in 1990. Of the 11% decline, only 4% had
occurred from 1957 to 1980; only after 1980, did
the food expenditure decline sharply. In fact, it
dropped almost 7% in the last decade. This decline would have been even larger if the food
prices had not increased significantly during the
1980s.
Table 2 shows the trend of food consumption
on a per capita basis in rural China. Fine grain

same period. Per capita meat consumption almost doubled over the period from 1978 to 1990.
Vegetable consumption changed very little, although it fluctuated across years. Alcohol and
tobacco consumption has increased sharply. Alcohol increased fourfold from 1978 to 1990, while
tobacco increased by 80% from 1981 to 1990.
In terms of food expenditure shares, rice has
declined while wheat increased slightly (Table 3).
Coarse grain has declined substantially due to the

fast growth of per capita income, implying that
farmers have reduced consumption of corn,
sorghum and sweet potatoes. Alcohol and tobacco expenditures have increased only slightly
although quantity consumed increased significantly, since their prices have changed very little
compared to other commodities. Other food expenditures including tea, sugar, fruit and fish
have increased substantially.

2. Dynamic AIDS model

As mentioned, as a result of substantial increase in per capita income in rural China, the
consumption patterns have changed dramatically
for some food products in the last decade. The
theoretical model to be employed for this study
has to take into account these changes. Thus, the
model has to be able to capture the dynamic

nature of the consumption parameters for Chinese rural households. In other words, the model
should have the ability to reflect the changes in
consumption patterns of the rural population.
However, due to data limitations and the aggregate nature of the data set, we cannot use formal
or conventional dynamic demand models. Therefore, the model should not only consider the
dynamic nature of the consumption patterns, but
also take into account the data limitations.
The advantages of the AIDS model have been
discussed by Deaton and Muellbauer (1980) and
Alston et al. (1990) among others. The dynamic
AIDS cost function has the following form:
ln C[t, u(t), p(t)] = ln a[t, p(t)]
+u(t)b[t,p(t)]
(1)
where
ln a [ t, p( t)]

Now, we formulate the habit behavior of consumers over time. Considering the data availability (only 9 years data), we consider the following
simplified habit formation:

respectively. The demand functions corresponding to (1) are:

3. Data sources and explanations

This study makes use of the greater availability
of suitable data since the earlier studies were
published. The income, expenditure and consumption data used in this study are from sample
surveys conducted by the General Organization
for Rural Household Survey of the State Statistical Bureau. The survey started in 1955, was suspended during the Cultural Revolution, and was
resumed in 1978. China began to publish provincial aggregate data from the surveys in 1982.
Households are selected using a three-stage stratified and systemic sampling method. Counties are
selected from each province, sub-village groups
(production teams) are selected from counties,
and households are selected from sub-village
groups. 4 All households are ranked using a major
indicator, such as income in the previous year.
Using cumulative population figures and the desired sample size, the sample interval can be
determined, and units falling in the midpoints of
each interval are selected for inclusion in the
survey (Taylor and Hardee, 1986; Tuan and
Crook, 1983; Lewis and Andrews, 1989). Chinese
officials recognize that this procedure is not
strictly in accordance with the principles of random sampling but claim that the impact is not
significant (Lewis and Andrews, 1989). The number of rural households surveyed has increased
each year since 1978, and in 1990 the sample
included 66 960 households.
Pooled time-series and cross-section data for
rural China were used in this study. The analysis
covers the period from 1982 to 1990. Ideally, the
analysis should cover some years before 1978, but
this may not be a serious problem to analyze
changes in consumption behavior since most rural
price and marketing reforms were undertaken
after 1982. Even the production responsibility

brigade, and production team. After the reform, the subcounty level has been changed to township (commune), village
(production brigade), and sub-village group (production team).

system was not fully implemented by 1983, 5 and
the effects of the system were not fully released
until 1984. 6 Twenty-eight provinces (autonomous
regions or municipalities) were included in the
analysis. Tibet and Hainan are excluded due to
data unavailability. Consumption data were available from the survey for individual food items
including rice, wheat, coarse grain, meat (including pork, beef and mutton), vegetables, fruit, tea,
sugar, alcohol, fish, cooking oil and tobacco. Price
data for these food items were taken from various
issues of China's Commodity Price Statistical
Yearbooks (China State Statistical Bureau, 19861991) and China's Price Yearbooks (China Ministry of Commerce, 1987-1991). These data were
collected from rural markets and trade posts in
various provinces. The expenditure data on these
items were derived from consumption and price
data.

4. Estimation and empirical results

First, we estimate equation (4), using iterative
SUR techniques with symmetry and homogeneity
restrictions applied. Then, we test whether the
price and expenditure elasticities have changed
over time. The test of whether or not price and
expenditure elasticities have changed is equivalent to the test of whether the parameters of time
trend in habit formation (5) are equal to zero
(i.e., [; = 0, eij = 0, and P; = 0). The WALD
statistics are employed in the test. The test results are presented in Table 4. We reject the
hypothesis that the constant term and price parameters have changed over time except for tobacco. However, we cannot reject the hypothesis
that expenditure elasticities have changed. There-

household responsibility system are 14% in 1980, 45% in
1981, 80% in 1982, 98% in 1983, respectively (Lin, 1992).
6 According to Fan's estimation, the production efficiency
effects of the reforms were released through a period of time
(0.753 in 1980, 0.768 in 1981, 0.788 in 1982, 0.791 in 1983,
0.83.1 in 1984, and 0.843 in 1985). Only after 1984 and 1985
did the efficiency start to improve greatly.

Note: The critical value of x 2 distribution for p = 0.05 is

at the 5% level, the hypothesis that demand parameters have
changed over the time.

fore, we re-estimate the equations in which the
price parameters do not change while expenditure parameters change.
The estimated food demand parameters are
presented in Table 5. Most of the estimates for
price coefficients are significant at the 5% level
except for some cross price parameters. Expenditure parameters are significant while three of
four of the time trend parameters of expenditures
are significant at the 5% level. The estimated
price and expenditure elasticities are presented
in Table 6. The price elasticities for grains including rice, wheat and coarse grains are similar,
ranging from -0.455 for wheat to -0.547 for
rice. The price elasticity for meat is higher than
for both grains and vegetables. Alcohol has the

highest price elasticity. Tobacco has a positive
price elasticity which indicates that Chinese farmers increase tobacco consumption even when tobacco prices rise. In fact, per capita consumption
of tobacco in rural China has risen dramatically
even though tobacco prices have increased
slightly. Most of the cross price elasticities have
positive signs which mean that they are substitutes. However, both tobacco and alcohol have
three negative signs of cross price elasticities.
Expenditure elasticities of demand for grains are
inelastic which indicate that grains are necessary
goods. The expenditure elasticities for rice and
coarse grains are declining, while the wheat expenditure elasticity is increasing. The demand for
meat and vegetables is elastic in total food expenditure, and this demand is increasing over time.
Thus, meat and vegetables are considered luxury
goods. The demands for tobacco and alcohol are
elastic with respect to food expenditures, which
implies that Chinese farmers will spend more on
these items as their incomes rise.
These estimates can be compared with those
of other studies. Since very few studies (except
Lewis and Andrew, 1989) have reported expenditure and price elasticities for Chinese rural
households, we only compare our estimates with
Lewis and Andrews. All of our estimates of both
expenditure and price elasticities are higher than
theirs (the expenditure elasticities of grain, pork,
poultry and fish are 0.22, 1.02, 1.95 and 3.56,
respectively, and the price elasticities of those
commodities are -0.14, -0.23, -0.09 and

- 0.69, respectively). This may be partly explained by the fact that this study covers a much
longer period, and that prices and marketing
mechanisms have improved recently. Farmers may
have become more responsive to the price
changes. The Lewis and Andrews' study only
covered the period from 1982 to 1985.

5. Conclusions

This study shows that rural reforms in China
have had a significant impact on the food consumption patterns of Chinese rural households.
Per capita consumption of grains increased in the
early-reform period but has stabilized recently.
Rice consumption has been stagnant, while wheat
consumption continues to increase. Coarse grain
consumption has declined almost by half since
1982. Meat consumption increased sharply during
the beginning of the reform, but the growth has
slowed down recently. Vegetable consumption is
stagnant, while alcohol and tobacco consumption
has increased substantially. In terms of the cost
structure in food consumption, Chinese farmers
have reduced their expenditures on grain consumption while they have increased their expenditure shares on meat, vegetables, alcohol, tobacco and other food items.
The rural reforms have affected consumption
behavior through both price and income changes.

We empirically tested whether the price and expenditure elasticities have changed over this reforming period. Our results showed that price
elasticities have not changed while expenditure
elasticities have changed.
These results may have important policy implications for China as well as agricultural and trade
policies of other countries. The expenditure elasticities for all food items are positive, implying
that Chinese rural households will continue to
increase their consumption on all these food items
as their incomes rise. The expenditure elasticities
for rice and coarse grains are declining, and that
for coarse grains dropped to almost zero. The
expenditure elasticities for meat, vegetables, tobacco and alcohol are all elastic and increasing
over time. The demand for these luxury food
items will accelerate as incomes rise. Therefore,
China will likely face increasing pressure to import food in the future as its economy expands
and per capita incomes rise.
The decline of rice expenditure elasticity and
increase of wheat expenditure elasticity imply that
China will continue to export rice and import
wheat. The high expenditure elasticity for meat
and low demand for direct coarse grain consumption means that China may reduce its direct coarse
grain consumption and increase the use of coarse
grains as animal feed. Due to the limited land
resources, China may import substantial amounts
of feed grains from the international market and

use its relatively cheap labor force to develop its
livestock industry.
