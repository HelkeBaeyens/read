1. Introduction

The continuous creation/introduction of new
technology has been used as a standard for distinguishing a modem agricultural system from a traditional system (Schultz, 1964). However, in developing countries, some new agricultural technologies
have been only partially successful in improving
productive efficiency. This is often attributed to a
lack of ability and/ or willingness to adjust input
levels on the part of producers, due to familiarity
with traditional agricultural systems (i.e., Schultz's
'poor but efficient' hypothesis) andI or the presence
of institutional and cultural constraints (Ghatak and
lngerset, 1984). These considerations suggest that, in
some cases, there may exist a negative relationship
between technical progress in conventional agriculture and realized efficiency gains.

This paper examines efficiency for hybrid rice in
China. Rice is a very important crop in Chinese
agriculture. Since 1976, F1 hybrid varieties 1 have
become increasingly important in Chinese rice production, relative to 'conventional' rice varieties,
which are predominantly improved semi-dwarf varieties. 2 In 1990, approximately 40% of China's rice
was planted in hybrid rice (Lin, 1994). While hybrid

1 F hybrids are a type of high yielding variety of rice. The
1
production of F 1 hybrid seed involves a complicated three-line
method (Lin, l99la). First, a cytoplasmic male-sterile parent plant
is located. This plant is then crossed with a maintainer line to
produce offspring that, while sterile, have desirable genetic characteristics. These seeds are then crossed with a 'restorer' line to
produce F 1 seeds with normal self-fertilizing capabilities.
2 Strictly speaking, conventional rice varieties currently being
used in China are not traditional in the Schultz sense but are
instead post 'green revolution' varieties. Therefore, the newer
hybrid rice vruieties are 'third generation' varieties.

rice has been introduced to some other rice producing countries, China is the only country in the world
in which hybrid rice is widely used in commercial
production.
The Chinese government often influences the diffusion of new agricultural technologies according to
its self-sufficiency objective. As a result, the importance of efficiency considerations in the adoption
decision regarding hybrid rice at the regional and
producer level is uncertain. The measurement of
technical and economic efficiency for hybrid rice
production, and the relationship of efficiency and
producer socioeconomic characteristics would be
useful in addressing these issues. While other studies
have examined economic issues related to the adoption and production of hybrid rice (e.g., He et al.,
1984, 1987; Lin, 1991a,b, 1992, 1994), little attention has been given to the examination of efficiency
for hybrid rice production in China.
Most studies that examine efficiency in developing country agriculture have focused on technical
efficiency (Bravo-Ureta and Pinheiro, 1993). While
physical productivity considerations are important,
improvements in economic efficiency will lead to
greater benefits to agricultural producers in these
countries. Previous studies have examined efficiency
in rice production for other developing countries
(e.g., Dawson et al., 1991; Kalirajan, 1991). However, few studies have examined the effects of technical change on efficiency.
The primary purpose of this paper is to examine
the effects of technical change on efficiencies of
traditional and modem agriculture within the context
of rice production in China, i.e., to provide a test of
Schultz's 'poor but efficient' hypothesis. In doing
so, both technical and economic efficiencies are
considered within the context of technical change
(i.e., adoption of hybrid rice). A secondary objective
is to examine the linkage between efficiency in rice
production and producer socioeconomic characteristics in order to provide information that may be
useful in analysing the effects of policies designed to
improve the productivity of new agricultural technologies.
These objectives are achieved through an examination of productive efficiency for conventional and
hybrid rice in China. Two frontier production functions are estimated; one for conventional rice and

one for hybrid rice. These functions are then used to
measure the degree of efficiency for Chinese rice
production.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. A brief review of frontier production function
methodology is provided in Section 2. This is followed by a discussion of the analytical model used
in the study, and a description of the study regions
and data. The results of the analysis are then presented and discussed. Section 6 summarizes the
study's findings and provides some concluding comments.

2. Efficiency and frontier production functions
Farrell (1957) distinguishes between technical and
allocative efficiency (or price efficiency) in production through the use of a 'frontier' production function. Technical efficiency is the ability to produce a
given level of output with a minimum quantity of
inputs under certain technology. Allocative efficiency refers to the ability of choosing optimal input
levels for given factor prices. Economic or total
efficiency is the product of technical and allocative
efficiency. An economically efficient input-output
combination would be on both the frontier function
and the expansion path.
Empirical studies of productive efficiency have
used a variety of approaches in modelling frontier
production functions; parametric vs. nonparametric,
deterministic vs. stochastic, and programming methods vs. statistical methods. Battese (1992) provides a
review of parametric efficiency methods, both deterministic and stochastic. Bravo-Ureta and Pinheiro
(1993) provide a review of empirical studies relating
to farm level production efficiency in developing
countries.
Given the alternative empirical tools available, the
choice as to the 'best' method is unclear. Little
rigorous analysis has been done in assessing the
sensitivity of efficiency measures to the choice of
methodology. Bravo-Ureta and Rieger (1990) compare the results of deterministic (both programming
and econometric analyses) and stochastic parametric
efficiency models for a sample of US dairy farms.
While the estimates from each approach differ quantitatively, the ordinal efficiency rankings of farms

X. Xu, S.R. Jeffrey/ Agricultural Economics 18 ( 1998) 157-165

obtained from the different models appear to be quite
similar. This would suggest that, to a certain degree,
the choice between alternative modelling approaches
may be somewhat arbitrary.

3. Analytical model and empirical methods
This study employs a stochastic parametric decomposition and neoclassical duality model to measure the technical, allocative and economic efficiency of hybrid and conventional rice production in
China. The stochastic frontier production function
model is specified as follows:

( 1)
where Y is output (i.e., yieldjha), x. denotes the
actual input vector (i.e., input usejha), fJ is the
vector of production function parameters, v is a
random error term with zero mean and u is a nonnegative one-sided error term.
The frontier production function is represented by
f(X.,fJ), and is a measure of maximum potential
output for any particular input vector x •. Both v and
u cause actual production to deviate from this frontier. The random variability in production that cannot
be influenced by producers is represented by v (e.g.,
environmental factors such as temperature and moisture); it is identically and independently distributed
as N(O, a}) and may be considered as the 'normal'
error term. The non-negative error term u represents
deviations from maximum potential output attributable to technical inefficiency; u is identically
and independently distributed 'half normal' (i.e.,
IN(O, a-})1). 3
The use of stochastic, parametric methodology is
consistent with recent agricultural production efficiency studies (e.g., Bravo-Ureta and Evenson, 1994;
Kumbhakar, 1994; Parikh and Shah, 1994). There
are also some conceptual advantages to using a

3 Recently, the question of the most appropriate distribution for
the compound error term has arisen (Bravo-Ureta and Pinheiro,
1993). While more flexible distributional assumptions may be
made for u (e.g., Greene, 1990), there is no rigorous evidence that
these improve results. Likewise, most empirical stochastic production function studies use the half-normal distribution.

159

stochastic approach, as it allows for statistical noise
rather than attributing all deviations to efficiency
differences. Finally, this approach is relatively
straightforward to implement and interpret.
A Cobb-Douglas functional form is employed to
model rice production technology in this study. While
more flexible functional forms than the CobbDouglas may be chosen for modelling frontier agricultural production technology (e.g., the translog used
by Kumbhakar, 1994), Kopp and Smith (1980) suggest that functional form has a limited effect on
empirical efficiency measurement. The CobbDouglas form has been used in many empirical
studies, particularly those relating to developing
country agriculture. 4 The Cobb-Douglas functional
form also meets the requirement of being self-dual,
allowing an examination of economic efficiency.
The frontier production function model is estimated using Maximum Likelihood procedures. In
order to empirically measure technical efficiency, the
deviations from the frontier must be separated into a
random component (i.e., v) and an inefficiency component (i.e., u). Given the distributional assumptions
for u and v, the Maximum Likelihood estimation
provides sufficient information to calculate a conditional mean for u (Jondrow et al., 1982). From this
calculation, estimates of u and v may be determined.
Technical efficiency is empirically measured using adjusted output (Y *) for each firm. Adjusted
output represents the observed output (Y) adjusted
for statistical noise, and is calculated as follows:

Y * = f( x.;fJ)- u = Y- v

(2)

where x. represents actual input use, j() is the
'deterministic' frontier output, and u and v are
estimates of the random and inefficiency components
of overall deviations from the frontier.
Fig. 1 illustrates the difference between observed
and adjusted output. For firm i, Xi is the vector of
actual input use and Yi is the observed output. Given
the level of input use, the frontier output is represented by A. This is greater than the deterministic
frontier output (i.e., B = f(Xi; fJ)) due to favourable

4 The review by Battese ( 1992) of frontier production functions
provides an indication of the frequency with which Cobb-Douglas technology is assumed in these studies.

The technically efficient, economically efficient
and actual input vectors (XI' Xe and Xa, respectively) may be combined with the input price vector
P to compute technical efficiency (TE), economic
efficiency (EE) and allocative efficiency (AE) indices, as follows:
TE = ( x;P)j( X~P)

conditions (i.~e., vi> 0). The total deviation from the
frontier function for this firm, as defined by Eq. (1)
(i.e., u - u) is the distance BY;. This distance may
be partitioned into the random component (i.e., u =
AB) and the inefficiency component (i.e., u = AY)
using the method developed by Jondrow et al. (1982).
As indicated by Eq. (2), u; (i.e., distance A Y) is
subtracted from the deterministic frontier output to
obtain the adjusted output for firm i (Y; * ). Similarly,
firm j uses inputs Xj to produce lj. Frontier output
for this firm is C. The total deviation from the
deterministic frontier function (i.e., DY) may be
partitioned into the random component CD (i.e.,
u < 0) and the inefficiency component CYr Adjusted
output 1j * is equal to the deterministic frontier
output minus uj (i.e., D- CYj).
Adjusted output ( Y * ) is used to calculate the
technical efficient input vector (X1). X 1 is derived
by simultaneously solving Eq. (1) and the input
ratios X 1 /X; = k; (i > 1) where k; is equal to the
observed ratio of the two inputs (i.e., from Xa) in
the production of Y *. Battese (1992) provides a
detailed explanation of stochastic frontier production
function methodology and the calculation of X 1•
Given the assumption of Cobb-Douglas technology, the frontier production function is self-dual.
Thus, the corresponding cost frontier can be derived
analytically from the stochastic frontier production
function estimate. Shephard's lemma is used to determine the set of conditional factor demand functions. These functions provide the economically efficient levels of input use (Xe), given a particular
output level and set of input prices. Since the cost

where x;P is the technically efficient cost of production, X~P is the economically efficient cost of
production, and X~P is the actual cost of production
for any particular firm's observed level of output. In
all cases, efficient production is represented by an
index value of 1.0, and lower index values represent
less efficient production (i.e., a greater degree of
inefficiency).

4. Sample regions and study data
The data used in this study are obtained from a
cross-sectional survey of households in Jiangsu
province in China. The survey was carried out from
July 1985 to January 1986. Jiangsu province is located in the Yangtze River valley and is one of the
most important rice producing areas in China, as the
region's climate is well suited for rice production. In
1986, the average rice yield in this province was
6.76 metric tonjha, or 1.56 metric ton more than the
national average. The area sown to rice and total rice
output of the province, in 1986, represented 7.8 and
9.8%, respectively, of the totals for China.
Jiangsu province can be divided into three rice
production regions: north (i.e., north of the Yangtze
River valley), central (i.e., along the Yangtze River
valley) and south (i.e., south of the Yangtze River
valley). While natural agricultural production conditions are similar among these three regions, economic development has been rather unbalanced. In
the south, the economy is relatively well developed.
Peasants' annual income is approximately two times

greater in the south than in the north. As shown in
Table 1, peasants in the south are better educated
than those in the north and central regions. Due to
the greater development of non-farm rural industry
in the south, farmers in this region also have significantly more off-farm income than those in the north
and the central regions (Table 1).
Significant differences also exist among the three
regions in terms of relative input use in rice production. As shown in Table 1, the use of capital inputs is
highest in the south region (i.e., 29% greater than in
the north) and lowest in the north, while labour use
on a per hectare basis is lowest in the south (i.e.,
17% lower than in the north) and greatest in the
north. Given these differences in the characteristics
of agriculture between the three rice production regions of Jiangsu province, the north is defined as a
traditional agricultural region while the central and
the south are classified as more modern agricultural
regions, for the purposes of this study.
In establishing the sample for the farm household
survey, two counties are selected from each region
(i.e., south, central and north) on a random basis.
The six counties selected from this process are Wu,
jing and Jurong (south); Taixing and Jiandu (central),
and Huaiyin and Dafeny (north). Within each of
these counties, 15 conventional rice farmers and 15
hybrid rice farmers are randomly selected as the
sample households for the survey. This results in a
total sample size of 180 rice households, distributed
over 33 villages in the six counties.
Each of these 180 households is surveyed with
respect to output levels and input use in rice production, as well as socioeconomic characteristics. Rice

production and input data are collected on a per
hectare basis. Rice yield is expressed in terms of
metric tonjha. Data are collected for five productive
inputs; labour, chemical fertilizer, manurial fertilizer,
machinery and irrigation services, and pesticides.
Labour use is expressed as day jha, with 1 day being
equal to 8 h of labour. Chemical fertilizer use is
measured as metric tons of pure nutrient per hectare,
while manurial fertilizer use is measured in value
terms, aggregated by the local price. Machinery and
irrigation services are aggregated using tractor service time. Pesticides are measured in terms of kgjha.
In addition to input and output quantities, prices for
input and output are collected on a regional average
basis.
Socioeconomic characteristics are also collected
for the survey sample. These characteristics include
household size, total number of years of schooling
for household labour, average income from non-rice
farm sources, average non-farm income and total
area of rice production. These data are used in the
analysis to identify important characteristics influencing efficiency of rice production.
5. Empirical rtrsults

Cross-sectional data for a sample of 90 hybrid
rice (HR) households and 90 conventional rice (CR)
households are used to estimate 'average' and frontier rice production functions. 5 The sample size for

the CR production function is 100, since some HR
households are included in both samples (i.e., produce both hybrid and conventional rice). Dummies
are included in the model to represent the south
(D 1 = 1) and central (D 2 = 1) regions. Table 2 presents the maximum likelihood estimates of stochastic
frontiers for HR and CR. Standard OLS estimates
(i.e., the average functions) are provided for comparison.
Some implications may be drawn from the results
shown in Table 2. First, the constant term for the CR
function is higher than that for the HR function
(5.944 vs. 4.895). This lends credibility to the view
that since CR varieties have been adapted over time
for use in poor conditions with relatively low capital
input use, they have a higher 'basic' yield (Hayami
and Ruttan, 1985). Also, the regional yield differences captured by the dummy variables (D 1 and D 2 )
are much greater for HR production than for CR
production, particularly for the south region.
The results in Table 2 also suggest that the response in HR production is much more elastic with
respect to chemical fertilizer and pesticides than is
the case for CR production. This is also true to a
lesser extent for manurial fertilizer and machinery
services. The opposite is true for labour input use,
however. These results confirm the findings by Fan
(1991) that 'modem' inputs (e.g., chemical fertilizers

and machinery services) are becoming more important for Chinese agriculture over time, i.e., with the
increase in hybrid rice production. Overall, HR production is more responsive to scale increases in the
five inputs modelled in the analysis, i.e., the elasticity "of scale for the HR function is 0.804 vs. 0.387 for
CR production.
The HR and CR frontier functions are used, in
combination with regional average input prices, to
derive the frontier cost functions. The resulting cost
frontiers are as follows:

is the of the price of machinery service, measured as
the cost of renting tractor services; Pps is the price
of pesticides, weighted by the actual use of various

in Table 3.
One result that may be drawn from Table 3 is that
efficiency for HR production is lower than for CR
production. This is consistent across regions, and for
all three measures of productive efficiency. The relative (i.e., percentage) difference in allocative efficiency is greater than for technical efficiency. Not
surprisingly, the greatest difference is in economic

efficiency, since economic efficiency is calculated as
the product of technical and allocative efficiencies.
The degree of variability in efficiency is also greater
for HR production than for CR production, as measured by the standard deviation. This evidence provides support, in the context of Chinese agriculture,
to the theory about efficiency and technical progress
in traditional agriculture, and supports the 'poor but
efficient' hypothesis, i.e., farmers are allocatively
efficient with traditional varieties.
The other significant result that may be drawn
from Table 3 is that productive efficiency is greater
in the south than in the north. Efficiency values for
the central region lie between those for the north and
south. This difference is consistent for both HR and
CR production, and for all three measures of productive efficiency. However, the observed differences
are greater, on average, for HR production than for
CR production.
Relative to previous studies for other rice producing regions, Chinese rice production appears to display greater technical efficiency. For example, average technical efficiency estimates for rice production
in the Philippines and Malaysia are 0.50 (Kalirajan
and Flinn, 1983) and 0.65 (Kalirajan and Shand,
1986), respectively. These differences are not surprising, as production decisions in China during the
relevant time period (i.e., mid-1980's) were largely
controlled by local government, and a goal of the
Chinese government at that time was to maximize
rice yield. Comparisons for allocative and economic
efficiency are not made, as relatively few studies
examine these aspects of productive efficiency.
The efficiency calculations reveal significant differences among regions and peasants in HR production. Schumpterian theory of economic development
suggests that technical efficiency is influenced by
technical knowledge and understanding, as well as
by the socioeconomic environment within which the
farmer must make decisions (Kalirajan, 1990). Based
on previous studies (Bravo-Ureta and Pinheiro,
1993 ), three characteristics are chosen as indicators
of this socioeconomic environment and are subsequently used as explanatory variables in the analysis
of productive efficiency for HR production: (i) education, measured by average years of schooling for
household labour; (ii) land size, measured by the
total land area cultivated; and (iii) total household

non-agricultural income. OLS procedures are used to
estimate the relationship between productive efficiency and these characteristics.
The underlying assumption in this type of procedure is that the explanatory variables are exogenous
to the decisions made by producers. While this is
likely true for land size and education, it is not
normally the case for non-farm income. 6 Given the
differences between regions in terms of off-farm
employment opportunities, however, it may be argued that to a certain extent non-farm income is
exogenous. Likewise, Kalirajan (1991) argues that
since variables such as farm size, education and
non-farm income have indirect influences on technical efficiency, it is appropriate to include these in a
secondary analysis.
The results of this analysis are presented in Table
4. Overall, the explanatory ability of the three variables included in the analysis is limited (i.e., R 2
values are generally less than 0.5), and not all regressions or parameter estimates are significant. Education appears to be a significant factor in explaining
technical efficiency, but not as significant for allocative efficiency. A positive relationship appears to
exist between land size, and economic and allocative
efficiency in modern agricultural regions (i.e., the
south), while the opposite is true for traditional

agricultural areas (i.e., the north). This suggests that
the predominantly small farm sizes may pose a
constraint to technical change in more modern regions, but not in more traditional agricultural production areas. A similar analysis was conducted for CR
production, but no significant relationships were
found.

6. Concluding comments and policy implication
This paper uses a stochastic production and cost
frontier to derive technical, allocative and economic
efficiency of Chinese conventional rice and hybrid
rice production. The results suggest that while HR
production increases the potential economies of scale
for Chinese rice production, observed productive
efficiencies are lower than for CR production. The
results of this study are consistent with 'poor but
efficient' hypothesis; peasants are more efficient in
allocating inputs for CR production than for HR
production. This is consistent for both modern and
traditional agricultural areas.
Facing increasing population pressures, China has
adopted policies designed to improve technical efficiency and total productivity. This study reveals a
positive relationship between efficiency and education for HR production, thus, emphasizing the importance of considering peasants' abilities to receive and
understand information relating to new agricultural
technology. This study also determines that land size

is a positive factor in explaining the efficiency of HR
in modern agricultural areas. This suggests that in
modern agricultural regions, the predominantly small
farm size may pose a restraint to technical change
and thus, supports the argument for further liberalization in land markets.
