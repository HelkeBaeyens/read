Abstract

Variables related to farmers' awareness and attitudes towards intercropping of immature rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) stands,
extension contacts, education level, and experience with farming other crops are positively associated with the probability
of adoption. Higher levels of off-farm income are associated with reduced intercropping in immature rubber stands. Farmers
who are sole owners of the land and engaged in full or part-time rubber farming show lower adoption rates than other land
ownership groups. Social participation, family size, experience with farming rubber, immature and mature rubber stands size,
and the nature of the land (fiat/sloped) do not significantly influence adoption. These conclusions were obtained from a logit
model estimated by employing the results of a survey of 588 smallholder rubber farmers from five major rubber-growing
regions in Sri Lanka.

1. Introduction
Rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) is produced on around
8% (161,500ha) of the agricultural land in Sri
Lanka (Agricultural Crops and Livestock Survey,
1992-1993). About 33% of this area is grown in the
smallholder sector (Anonymous, 1993). 70% of total
rubber growers are smallholders (land size of less
than 4 ha). According to the agricultural crops and
livestock survey in 1992-1993, around 60% of the

smallholder farmers own less than 1 ha. Hence, average smallholder rubber land size is very small compared to the estate sector where around 67% of land
area is owned by 30% of the total rubber cultivators.
The small size of rubber holdings has aggravated
the problems associated with the long immature period of rubber. After replanting or new planting, farmers face a gap in income of 5-7 years during which
the immature rubber cannot be tapped for latex. The
estate sector has solved this problem by adopting an
annual replanting cycle, with the aim of maintaining
less than 20% of the rubber stands in the immature
phase. Because of the limited land available, this option is not very effective for smallholders, as even if
they replant only part of their land, the income loss is
quite considerable. After identifying this vital problem

in the sector, in 1979 the Rubber Research Institute of
Sri Lanka introduced the intercropping of immature
rubber with crops such as banana, pineapple, passion
fruit and coffee (Chandrasekera, 1979). The list of
recommended crops grew over time to include cocoa,
cinnamon, and tea. However, despite research interest for more than 20 years, survey studies show the
intercropping among rubber holders is not very attractive. According to Jayasena and Herath (1986), only
about 30-40% of smallholders with immature rubber stands were intercropping. Approximately 30%
of smallholders, who did not intercrop, believed that
the companion crop would exert a negative effect on
growth of the young rubber trees. A more recent study
by Stirling et al. (1998) shows that around 40% of the
smallholders are engaged in intercropping. This study
also identified the problems of theft and lack of knowledge as major reasons for not intercropping. However,
none of these studies have attempted to quantify
the factors influencing adoption of this farming
system.
According to a comprehensive review on the adoption of agricultural innovations by Feder and Umali
(1993), the green revolution from the 1960s to the
early 1980s motivated numerous studies to explain
the determinants of adoption during the early stages
of the diffusion process. Thereafter, studies concentrated on agricultural innovations that have reached
maturity. Mostly these included the adoption of high
yielding varieties in particular and a package of interrelated technologies. In this regard, relatively few
empirical studies have examined the adoption of
cropping systems. Neill and Lee (1999) attempt to
explain the adoption of cover crops in maize cultivation. A case study in northwest India discusses the
factors influencing an agro-forestry farming system
in which sugarcane, wheat, sorghum and turmeric
are grown with a poplar forestry crop (Sharma and
Kumar, 2000). Nganje et al. (2001) analyse the factors
involved in the adoption of slash and burn agriculture
versus multi- and mono-cropping systems by farmers
in Cameroon. However, to our knowledge specific research on the adoption of a farming system in which
perennial cash crops such as rubber are intercropped
with short-term crops is not performed in the literature. Thus, the present study attempts to quantify the
factors influencing this vital aspect in the smallholder
rubber sector in Sri Lanka.

2. Study area and data
A sample survey was conducted between October
1997 and March 1998, covering the five major
rubber-growing regions (Kalutara, Kegalle, Colombo,
Gampaha and Ratnapura) where over 80% of Sir
Lanka's rubber is cultivated. Intercropping is generally restricted to the immature phase of rubber.
Therefore, the survey was restricted to smallholders
with rubber plantations less than 6 years old. A stratified random sampling methodology was employed in
selecting farmers. Following the sampling procedure
of Cochran (1963), the number of farmers for each
region was determined considering the cost factor and
the total budget available. The number of farmers for
different land sizes within a range was determined by
the proportional allocation method.
Many technology adoption studies distinguish between the rate of adoption (e.g. the proportion of
farmers adopting intercropping) and the intensity of
adoption (defined based on the level of use of a technology, e.g. the proportion of the farmer's immature
rubber land planted to other crops). In the smallholder rubber sector in Sri Lanka, farmers tend to
intercrop their entire immature rubber stands when
they adopt this new rubber farming system. This may
be due to the very small land size and the familiarity
of farmers with this farming system (around 20 years
ago this farming system was introduced). Thus, the
level of intercropping immature rubber is either the
entire stand (100%) or not at all (0%). Hence, in this
study, data have been gathered on the rate of adoption
alone. Also, various other socio-economic factors and
attitudes towards intercropping were recorded.
The total budget allocated to the survey was 100,000
Sri Lankan rupees (the exchange rate at the time of
this study was US $1 = Rs. 70), which was divided
equally between the five regions. The estimated unit
cost for surveying a smallholder in the Kalutara region,
which is nearest to the operational area (the Rubber
Research Institute of Sri Lanka), was Rs. 125, whilst
that of all other regions was Rs. 150. Consequently, the
number of smallholders to be interviewed in Kegalle,
Colombo, Gampaha and Ratnapura was 167, and 200
in Kalutara. However, while it was possible to interview all selected smallholders in the Kalutara region,
problems with transport and the availability of farmers within the 6-month survey period resulted in fewer

P.H.M.U. Herath, H. Takeya/Agricultural Economics 29 (2003) 159-168

case studies in Colombo (88), Gampaha (70), Ratnapura (90), and Kegalle (140). Accordingly, the total
sample size is 588 farmers. Questionnaire-based structured interviews were conducted for each smallholder,
and a visual assessment was used to gather site information.

3. Modelling technology adoption
The decision to intercrop or not to intercrop immature rubber stands can be explained as a discrete
variable. Hence, regarding choice of models, the most
important aspect of the decision framework is the dichotomous dependent variable. Classical linear methods are inappropriate for dichotomous choices since
they can lead to heteroscedasticity variances. This
problem is typically remedied by using maximum
likelihood estimation (MLE), although heteroscedasticity in MLE is also a potentially serious problem
leading to inconsistent estimators (Greene, 2000).
According to Wooldridge (2000), when heteroscedasticity is observed, such models require more general
estimation. However, such models are not often used
in practice, since logit and probit models with flexible
functional forms in the independent variables tend to
work well.
In making decisions about the adoption of a given
technology, a farmer evaluates the new technology
in terms of its incremental benefit. If the monetary
benefit of using the technology is higher than the old
technology, the preference or utility (U) for that technology (assuming monotonic relationship between
utility and benefits) will be higher than the old technology. According to Greene (2000), random utility
models address these types of individual choice situations. A common specification is the linear random
utility model.
Suppose an individual farmer's utility after adopting the new technology (intercropping immature rubber stands) for a given vector of economic, social, and
physical factors (Z) is denoted by Ure (Z), and the
utility without adoption by UNre (Z). Then, the preference for adopting or not adopting can be defined as
a linear relationship
Urc(Z)

=

Zf3re +ere

YNrc(Z) = Zf3Nre + eNre

161

In this case, f3re, f3Nre and ere, eNre are response
coefficients and random disturbances associated with
the adoption and non-adoption of intercropping, respectively. Assuming that the qualitative variable Yindexes the adoption decision, then it will take a value
of one if the farmer adopts the technology and zero
otherwise. The probability that a given farmer will intercrop his immature rubber land can be expressed as
a function of Z as follows
P(Y = 1) = P(Ure > UNie)
= P(Zf3re +ere > Zf3Nie + eNie)
= P{Z(f3re - f3Nie) > eNre- ere}
= P(Zf3 > ~) = F(Zf3)

where P is a probability function, ~ = eNre - ere is a
random disturbance term, f3 = (f3re- f3Nie) a vector of
unknown parameters which can be interpreted as the
net influence of the vector of independent variables on
adoption of intercropping, and F (Zf3) is the cumulative
distribution function for ~ evaluated at Zf3.
The exact distribution of F depends on the distribution of the random term ~- The probit model arises
from assuming a normal distribution, and a logit model
arises from assuming a logistic distribution. Under the
standard assumptions about the error term, there is
no a priori reason to prefer probit to logit estimation
(Greene, 2000). Accordingly, in most applications, it
seems not to make much difference. Considering all
these aspects, a logit model was developed to study
the factors affecting intercropping in the smallholder
rubber sector in Sri Lanka.
According to the logit model, the probability of an
individual rubber farmer adopting intercropping (IC)
in his immature rubber stands, given economic, social,
and physical characteristics (Z) is, P(ICI Z) and can
be specified as
P(ICIZ) =

exp(Z{J + ~)
1 + exp(Zf3 + ~)

where a< Zf3 <a.
The probability of not adopting intercropping,
P(NICIZ), is therefore,
exp(Zf3 + ~) ]
P(NICIZ) = 1- P(ICIZ) = 1- [ 1 + exp(Z{J + ~)

4. Empirical model
The farm and farmer specific factors included in
the model are based on innovation diffusion theory
and earlier studies. Detailed reviews of these factors
are given by Feder and Umali (1993). The selected
variables for this study included the farmer's experience with rubber-growing (FEXR), experience with
the other crops recommended for intercropping (FEXOCRO), immature rubber land size (IMRLS-only
land suitable for intercropping is considered), mature
rubber land size (MARA-as a source of income),
whether the rubber land is sloped or flat (TERR), availability of off-farm income (OFI), contacts with extension agents (NEVM), social participation (SOPC),
decision maker's education level (DMEDUL), farm
family size (FAMSIZE), nature of land ownership
(OWNSHIP), distance between a farmer's residence
and the rubber land (DIS-as a measure of security),
and a farmer's attitude towards intercropping with
immature rubber (ATT). A complete description of
the variables specified and the types of measures that
have been employed is given in Table 1.
Implementation of the model must account for different ecological conditions (e.g. soil quality and rainfall patterns) among the five different regions selected
for the study. Therefore, regional dummy variables for
four different regions are also incorporated into the
preliminary estimation of the model. The Ratnapura
region, where the lowest share of intercropping was
recorded serves as the reference. Also, the Wald test
(the equivalent of the Chow test in OLS estimates)
was conducted to verify the equality of the coefficients
across these regions.

In many studies, farm size has been shown to positively affect adoption decisions. A study by Negate
and Parrikh (1999) indicates a positive impact of farm
size on the adoption of improved wheat varieties.
Also, a study by Doss and Morris (2001) revealed that
the adoption of improved maize varieties is positively
associated with the amount of land owned. Therefore,
it is hypothesised that the sign on this variable, the
immature rubber land size in the empirical model, is
positive.
Mature rubber land size has been considered as a
separate explanatory variable in this study as it could
act as a source of income for intercropping activities in
immature rubber stands. In this regard, it might have a
positive impact on intercropping. However, considering problems related to mature rubber such as scarcity
of tapping labour and high price fluctuations, this variable might also reduce the immature rubber activities
of the farmer. Therefore, the sign of the variable mature rubber area cannot be decided a priori.
In this study, the availability of human capital is
indicated by education level and years of farming
experience, both in rubber and other crops. Many
studies of the adoption and diffusion of innovations
investigate the effect of human capital investments on
adoption behaviour. Some of the rural social literature (Shoemaker, 1971) has suggested that adoption
depends on the decision makers' education and information level. Mittal and Kumar (2000) find a positive
impact of rural literacy on the adoption of high yielding varieties of rice and wheat in India. Also, Doss
and Morris (2001) indicate that education is a significant determinant of the adoption of modern varieties
of maize in Ghana. Thus, the impact of the main decision maker's education level on the intercropping
of immature rubber is assumed to be positive.
The impact of experience on adoption is ambiguous a priori. As experience increases (and therefore
age increases), the time horizon in which to reap
the benefits of adoption decreases, while risk aversion and learning by doing with current management
practices may increase. On the other hand, greater
experience could also lead to better knowledge of
spatial variability in the field and more accurate assessment of the benefits of adoption. Shiyami et al.
(2000) find that the more experience with growing
chickpea, the higher the adoption of new varieties.
Considering the above factors, the impact of farming

experience in rubber and the other crops is expected
to be positive.
Contacts with extension agents and social participation are expected to have a positive effect on adoption
based upon innovation diffusion theory. Such contacts,
by exposing farmers to information, can be expected
to stimulate adoption. Higher visitation rates by extension personnel reduces not only the likelihood of
farmers choosing slash and burn agriculture, but also
promotes movement into multi- and mono-cropping in
Cameroon (Nganje et al., 2001). Therefore, the impact
of variable extension contacts is expected to be positive in this model. The impact of the variable social

participation is hypothesised to be positive based on
a study by Sharma and Kumar (2000). Accordingly,
socio-economic status has a positive impact on the
adoption of agro-forestry innovations in the Haryana
State of India. In this study, an index has been developed to measure the socio-economic status. Social
participation is one of the major components of that
index.
The role of off-farm income on the decision to
adopt is not very clear. It is observed that farmers
with off-farm income are less risk-averse than farmers
without sources of off-farm income. Off-farm activities will reduce the management resources available

164

for the adoption process, but access to outside information may have positive effects. Given that most
of rubber small holders depend on family labour for
their farming, off-farm activities might have a negative impact on intercropping. According to Dimara
and Skurass (1998), an increase in the off-farm annual work units decreases the probability of adopting
flue-cured tobacco varieties in Greece, but this relationship is not statically significant. Considering all
these factors, it is difficult to predict the sign of this
independent variable in the model.
There is mixed evidence about the impact of land
ownership and full time operation of a farm on incentives to adopt a new technology. On the one hand, land
ownership is hypothesised to increase incentives by
lengthening planning horizons and the share of benefits accruing to the adopters while lowering the rates
of time preference. In this regard, full time operators
are expected to be more likely to adopt a time and
management intensive technology (Cooper and Keirn,
1996). On the other hand, the potential for such technologies to conserve input use, reduce cost, and provide economic benefits even in the short run could
create incentives for adoption even among renters and
part-time operators as observed by Lee and Stewart
(1983). Accordingly, the sign of the variable, land
ownership, has not been assigned.
The influence of household size on the decision
to adopt is not clear. If an agricultural technology
increases the seasonal demand for labour, it would
be less attractive to a household with limited family
labour. Besides labour demand, the other factor related to family size, mentioned as a consideration in
adoption decisions, is the consumption pressure the
household faces, i.e. the responsibility of the head of
the household to ensure that the minimum food requirement of the family is met. If the technology is a
staple crop, the direction of effect on adoption in subsistence agriculture is ambiguous. While the higher
consumption pressure a larger family faces may motivate adoption, the risk involved with a new and
untried variety may inhibit the head of a larger household from adopting it. Considering the above factors,
the impact of family size on intercropping is assumed
to be positive, as there is no increased seasonal demand of labour in the recommended major crops such
as banana and pineapple; however, this could be an
ideal option for dealing with consumption pressure.

Attitudes towards intercropping have been considered in the model as a psychological factor that would
affect this new system of rubber farming. In the literature, attitudes have been defined as the degree of a
farmer's positive or negative feelings towards an innovation. It is assumed that attitudes largely depend on
household values, beliefs and circumstances (Sharma
and Kumar, 2000). In this study, attitude towards intercropping immature rubber stands was evaluated by
accessing the farmer's opinion directly through interviews. Farmers who have stated either that they believe
that this cropping system would enhance the growth
of rubber, or those who believe that there will not be
any negative effects on rubber are considered to have
positive feelings towards this cropping system. In contrast, farmers who believe that there would be some
negative effects on rubber or those who express uncertainty regarding the consequences of this farming
system are categorised as farmers with negative feelings towards the system. In this model, attitudes have
been included as a dummy variable. Farmers with negative feelings towards the intercropping are considered
as the base category. Farmers with positive feelings
towards this farming system, hypothesised to have a
positive impact on intercropping, are compared to the
base category.
The distance between a farmer's residence and the
rubber land is employed as a measure of security
and expected to have a negative sign. This is based
on previous survey studies in which theft was identified as one of the major problems in intercropping.
Finally, nature of the rubber land is included in the
model as a dummy variable. Farmers with sloped
lands are considered as the base category. Thus, level
land is hypothesised to have a positive influence on
intercropping compared to this base category.

attitude towards intercropping between the adopter
and non-adopter populations. Extension agents visited
the adopters frequently, and most of them (92%) have
positive feelings towards intercropping compared to
the non-adopters (57%). Most of the non-adopters
have access to off-farm income (84%) compared to
the adopters (16%). Adopters' farming experience
with other crops (6.2 years) is higher than that of the
non-adopters (1 year). About half the population of
adopters (43%) has level land whereas only about a
quarter of the population (27%) of non-adopters has
level land. There is no significant difference between
the population means of the adopters and non-adopters
for the variables immature rubber land size, distance
between residence and land, social participation, land
ownership, decision maker's education level, farming
experience with rubber, mature rubber area size, and
family size.
5.2. Estimated logit model
This section presents the results of estimating
the model with pooled data across all five regions.
The empirical logit model (1) was estimated using
SHAZAM econometric software, version 9 (Whistler
et al., 2001). The estimated coefficients and the corresponding t-ratios are given in Table 3. The estimation
of the parameters is obtained by the Newton-Raphson
iterative procedure. To avoid the possibility of false
pooling of data, the Wald test (the equivalent of the

Chow test in OLS estimates) was conducted to verify
the equality of coefficients across the different regions. This test fails to reject the null hypothesis that
these coefficients are equal (Table 3). The estimates
of the dummy variables included in the model to represent different regions also show that there are no
significant differences in adoption among the regions
(Table 3). The likelihood-ratio test of the hypothesis
that the coefficients of all the explanatory variables
are zero, has a Chi-squared value of 533.2 with 15
d.f., suggesting that the estimated model is highly
significant. The goodness of fit measure, Estrella R 2
(0.8) indicates a very satisfactory fit. Estrella (1998)
has suggested that this measure may be interpreted
intuitively in a similar way to R 2 in the linear regression context. The model correctly predicts 95% (554
out of 581) of the responses. Conect predictions are
slightly higher for the non-adopters, 95% (388 out of
407), than for the adopters, 92% (166 out of 181).
In addition to the estimated coefficients, the
marginal impacts of changes in the independent variables on the probability of intercropping are also
presented. The interpretations of these marginal impacts are dependent on the unit of measurement of the
independent variables. For example, the marginal impacts show that for a 1% increase in extension visits
per month, the probability of intercropping immature
rubber stands increases by 0.05%. This implies a
highly elastic response of 6.89 when evaluated at the
mean values of the independent variables.

a Marginal effects evaluated at the sample means.
* P < 0.1 (one-tailed).
*** p < 0.01.

According to Greene (2000), the marginal effect
of a binary independent variable can be estimated
by simply taking the derivative with respect to the
binary variable as if it were a continuous variable.
Furthermore, the computation of the derivatives of
the conditional mean function is useful when the
variable in question is continuous. However, when
the explanatory variable is a dummy, the marginal
effects generally produce a reasonable approximation
to the change in the probability that Y = 1, at a point
such as the mean of the regressors. Following this,
the estimated marginal effects of dummy explanatory
variables could be defined. For an example, the estimated coefficient for the variable attitude implies that
for the farm population as a whole, a 10% increase in
the number of farmers with positive attitudes towards
intercropping immature rubber will result in a 0.1%
increase in the probability of intercropping, which
represents an elastic response of 1.5. For most of
the explanatory variables, except NEVM, ATT, and
OFI, the intercropping of immature rubber stands was
found to be inelastic with respect to changes in these
variables. The most elastic response was observed for
a change in extension visits, whereas the most inelas-

tic response was observed for a change in variable
FAMSIZE.

6. Empirical findings and policy design
Variables representing the farmers' awareness of
the intercropping immature rubber stands, extension
contacts, education level, and experience with farming other crops are shown to have significant positive
impacts on the probability of adoption. In fact, extension contacts are shown to have the biggest impact
with the highest estimated elasticity. Experience with
farming rubber and the social participation of farmers
are not significant. In this study social participation
is approximated by the farmers' actual involvement
in co-operative societies. During the survey, it was
observed that the rubber farmers' main co-operative
association is with rubber smallholders' co-operative
societies. The main objective of these societies is to
assist farmers with marketing rubber. However, our
results suggest that a detailed study of the activities of
these societies is needed in order to promote their involvement in other productive measures in the sector.

In this regard, an active involvement of extension officers in these societies may be useful. Furthermore,
the results show that increasing farmers' awareness
through extension and education programs could immensely improve intercropping practices in immature
smallholder rubber stands.
The dummy variable representing the fanner's attitude towards intercropping immature rubber stands
has a significant impact on the probability of adoption. The base category in this regard was the farmers
who believe that intercropping would be harmful
to the rubber crop or who are uncertain about the
possible consequences of this new farming system.
The empirical results indicate that about 82% of
the total population and about 57% of the intercroppers belong to this base category, while 92% of
the non-intercroppers believe that this farming practice would be harmful or are uncertain. In terms of
marginal impacts, an increase of 10% in the farmers
with a positive attitude towards intercropping would
increase the numbered intercroppers by nearly 1%.
These figures suggest how important the improvement
of awareness is in order to enhance intercropping in
the smallholder rubber sector in Sri Lanka.
The dummy variable representing the ownership of
land shows a significant negative impact on the intercropping. This indicates that when there is single
ownership and the farmer is involved full or part-time
in farming, the probability of intercropping tends to
be lower compared to the base category, where rubber
lands have been rented or the immature rubber lands
have been leased for part-time operators for farming
during the immature period. According to Lee and
Stewart (1983), the potential for technologies to conserve input use, reduce costs, and provide economic
benefits even in the short run could create incentives
for adoption even among renters and part-time operators. During this survey, it was observed that renting
out rubber land during the immature period for intercropping is becoming popular among some smallholders. However, Gray (1997) concluded that most
of the farmers in one of the main rubber-growing
districts, Kegalle, are not aware of this land leasing
system. Also, some of the farmers are hesitant to
lease the land due to a lack of proper legal arrangements. Involvement by extension officers and other
related government institutions could facilitate this
activity.

Off-farm income is negatively associated with the
probability of adoption. The impact is significant. In
terms of marginal impacts, an increase of around 10%
in the number of farmers with off-farm income will
lead to a decline in the probability of intercropping
of about 1%. This may be due to a lack of resources
such as labour for farming activities due to off-farm
activities. However, the farmers with off-farm income
also include those who are receiving financial and
other assistance under government poverty alleviation
programs such as Samurdhi (prosperity movement).
In fact, this survey revealed that around 70% of the
farmers' main off-farm income was reported to be government assistance. Therefore, a proper co-ordination
of productive farming activities with these types of
poverty alleviation programs should be given due policy attention.
The distance between the rubber land and the
farmer's residence (a proxy for the theft problem)
lacks explanatory power. This result was unexpected
as previous surveys by Jayasena and Herath (1986)
and Stirling et a!. (1998) reveal that theft is one of the
major causes impeding intercropping activities in the
sector. The present results suggest that the theft problem does not affect the intercropping decision, or it
could indicate that the variable distance is not a good
indicator of this problem. The effect of immature and
mature rubber land size and the nature (fiat/sloped)
of the rubber lands is not significant in the model.
