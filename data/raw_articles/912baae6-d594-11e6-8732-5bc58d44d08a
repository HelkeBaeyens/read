Abstract
Why do men and women adopt agricultural technologies at different rates? Evidence from Ghana suggests that gender-linked
differences in the adoption of modern maize varieties and chemical fertilizer result from gender-linked differences in access
to complementary inputs. This finding has important policy implications, because it suggests that ensuring more widespread
and equitable adoption of improved technologies may not require changes in the research system, but rather introduction
of measures that ensure better access for women to complementary inputs, especially land, labor, and extension services.

1. Introduction
In recent years, development practitiOners have
become increasingly interested in questions relating to
the distributional impacts of technical change in agriculture. Scientific breakthroughs such as the muchpublicized green revolutions in wheat and rice have
brought about dramatic productivity gains in many
important cereal crops, but the persistence of chronic
malnutrition among a significant portion of the world's

population has led to the realization that millions of
people still lack reliable access to sufficient quantities of food. Many of these people are smallholder
farmers in developing countries.
This realization has focused increased attention on
issues relating to the development and dissemination
of improved agricultural technologies. If certain groups of farmers are not adopting improved technologies
or are adopting them at a lower rate than other groups,
then we need to determine why, because only by
understanding the reasons will we be able to develop
improved technologies that are appropriate for all.
More concretely, since women farmers tend to adopt
improved technologies at a lower rate than male farmers, we need to understand the reasons behind what

appear to be gender-linked differences in technology
adoption rates.

tary inputs that affect adoption indirectly, then it may
be more important to work on improving women's
access to these complementary inputs.

1.1. Research objectives
Using empirical data from Ghana, we address three
questions about gender and technology adoption. First,
does including gender as an explanatory variable in
standard regression models add to our understanding of the technology adoption process? Second, can
farmers' adoption decisions be better understood by
explicitly considering household structural variables,
particularly the gender of the household head? Third,
to what extent are frequently observed differences in
the rates at which men and women adopt improved
technology attributable to gender-linked differences in
access to complementary inputs, such as land, labor,
and extension services?
These questions are of obvious practical importance, because they go directly to the issue of whether
gender-related differences in adoption patterns occur
because (a) men and women have different preferences when it comes to technology, or (b) men and
women have the same preferences when it comes
to technology but face different constraints that prevent them from adopting at the same rate. Men's and
women's technology preferences can differ for many
reasons. For example, crop varietal preferences can
differ by gender if men and women have different
uses for a particular crop. In cases where women
grow a crop primarily for home consumption and
men grow the same crop primarily for sale, women
and men may have different preferences for varietal
characteristics such as appearance, taste, ease of processing, ease of cooking, and storage. Also, if women
farmers are intrinsically more risk averse than men or
less innovative, then this might explain lower levels of
adoption.
Identifying the causes of gender-related differences
in adoption is crucial, because if gender affects the
adoption process directly - in other words, if men
and women adopt at different rates even when they
face exactly the same constraints - then it may be
necessary to modify research strategies to ensure that
technologies are developed that meet their dissimilar needs. If, on the other hand, differential rates of
adoption arise because men and women face different
constraints, especially unequal access to complemen-

2. Maize in Ghana
Maize in Ghana makes a particularly appropriate
case study for this inquiry into the links between gender and adoption for at least three reasons.
First, maize is Ghana's most important cereal
crop. It is grown by the vast majority of rural households in all parts of the country except for the Sudan
Savannah zone of the far north. According to official
statistics, the area planted to maize in Ghana currently
averages about 650,000 ha per year. Most maize is
cultivated in association with other crops, so planting
densities for maize are generally low. Grain yields of
maize per unit land area are correspondingly modest,
averaging less that 2 t!ha. Total annual maize production is currently estimated at just over 1 million t.
Second, maize is the most widely consumed staple
in Ghana. A national survey carried out in 1990 revealed that over 94% of all households had consumed
maize during an arbitrarily selected 2-week period
(Alderman and Higgins, 1992). Another study based
on 1987 data found that maize and maize-based food
accounted for 10.8% of total food expenditures by
poor households and 10.3% of food expenditures by
all households (Boateng et al., 1990).
Third, both men and women cultivate maize in
Ghana. Furthermore- and in this respect Ghana differs from many other countries- women frequently
manage their own maize fields, contribute an important proportion of overall labor requirements, and
exercise complete discretion over the disposal of the
harvest. Because maize production activities are managed autonomously by men and women, technology
choice decisions tend to be made independently by
men and women, which makes it easier to distinguish
gender-related dimensions of the adoption process.

2.1. Ghana's maize-based farming systems
Generally speaking, the climate in Ghana grows
hotter and drier as one moves northward and inland
away from the Atlantic coast. Maize cropping systems
and production technologies vary between the four

C.R. Doss, M.L. Morris I Agricultural Economics 25 (2001) 27-39

agro-ecological zones in which significant amounts of
maize are cultivated.
The Coastal Savannah zone includes a narrow
belt of Savannah that runs along the Atlantic coast,
widening towards the east of the country. Farmers in
this zone grow maize and cassava as their principal
staples, often intercropped. Annual rainfall, which is
bimodally distributed, totals only 800 mm per year,
so most maize is planted following the onset of the
major rains beginning in March or April. Soils are
generally light in texture and low in fertility, and
productivity is low.
Immediately inland from the Coastal Savannah
lies the forest zone. Most of Ghana's forest is
semi-deciduous, with a small area of high rain forest
remaining only in the southwestern part of the country near the border with Cote d'Ivoire. Maize in the
forest zone is grown in scattered plots, usually intercropped with cassava, plantain, or cocoyam as part
of a bush fallow system. Some maize is consumed
in the forest zone, but it is not a leading food staple,
and much of the crop is sold. Annual rainfall averages about 1500 mm, and maize is planted both in the
major rainy season (beginning in March) and in the
minor rainy season (beginning in September).
Moving further north, the forest zone gradually
gives way to the transition zone. The exact boundary is
subject to dispute, which is not surprising considering
that the boundary area is characterized by a constantly
changing patchwork of Savannah and forest plots.
What is certain, however, is that the transition zone is
an important region for commercial grain production.
Much of the transition zone has deep, friable soils,
and the relatively sparse tree cover allows for more
continuous cultivation and greater use of mechanized
equipment. Rainfall is bimodally distributed and averages about 1300 mm per year. Maize in the transition
zone is planted in both the major and minor seasons,
usually as a monocrop or in association with yam or
cassava.
The Guinea Savannah zone occupies most of the
northern part of the country. Annual rainfall totals
about 1100 mm and falls in a single rainy season
beginning in April or May. Sorghum and millet are
the dominant cereals in the Guinea Savannah, but
maize grown in association with small grains, groundnut and/or cowpeas is also important. Some fields
are prepared by tractor, but most are prepared by

29

hand. Maize is grown in permanently cultivated fields
located close to homesteads, as well as in more distant
plots under shifting cultivation.
2.2. Improved maize production technologies

Our analysis focuses on factors affecting the adoption of two improved maize production technologies:
modem varieties (MVs) 2 and chemical fertilizer.
These technologies were developed and promulgated through the Ghana Grains Development Project
(GGDP), an 18-year research and extension project
that was established to develop and disseminate improved technologies for maize and grain legumes.
2.3. Modern varieties (MVs)

Prior to inception of the GGDP, plant breeders
working at Ghana's national maize breeding institute,
the Crops Research Institute (CRI), had developed
and released several MV s of maize. These early MV s
generated little interest among farmers, however, and
they were not widely adopted. Under the GGDP, the
CRI maize breeding program was reorganized, with
the objective of strengthening links with international
research centers. At the same time, an extensive
on-farm testing program was introduced to increase
the role of farmers in the varietal evaluation process.
These changes led eventually to the release of a series
of maize MV s characterized by high yielding ability,
increased resistance to diseases and insect pests, enhanced drought tolerance, and improved grain quality.
The seed of these MVs was produced and distributed
to farmers through a number of schemes involving
CRI, the extension service, NGOs, and private seed
companies.
2.4. Chemical fertilizer

At the time the GGDP was launched, few farmers
in Ghana were applying chemical fertilizer to their
maize fields. The low level of fertilizer use on maize
was quickly identified as a priority problem for rese2 As used here, the term modem varieties (MVs) refers to improved open-pollinating varieties (OPVs) and hybrids developed by a
formal plant breeding program. Local varieties refers to farmers'
traditional varieties.

30

arch, because experimental evidence showed clearly
that soil fertility was severely constraining yields
in many areas. Although the relative unpopularity
of fertilizer among Ghanaian maize farmers could
be attributed to a number of causes, one significant
problem was that there were no consolidated, widely
accessible recommendations for applying fertilizer to
maize. In an attempt to remedy this problem, GGDP
researchers organized an on-farm testing program
aimed at developing fertilizer recommendations for
maize. The challenge was to formulate recommendations that would be sufficiently flexible to accommodate the wide range of soil fertility conditions found
in farmers' fields, yet at the same time simple enough
to be incorporated into existing extension programs.
Following several years of trials, GGDP researchers
came up with a set of fertilizer recommendations that
distinguished among agro-ecological zones and took
into account field cropping histories. The recommendations were promoted through a national extension
campaign that included thousands of on-farm demonstrations and farmer field days.
It is important to note that the two technologies
differ in a number of ways that can be expected
to influence the adoption process. MVs are a relatively simple technology, in the sense that farmers
who decide to adopt MVs must make relatively few
changes to their current practices. MVs are also relatively inexpensive: the cost of MV seed comprises a
small proportion of total production costs. Primarily
for these reasons, MV s should be accessible to all
farmers, regardless of their resource endowment or
technical management skills.
In contrast, chemical fertilizer is a relatively
complex technology, in the sense that farmers who
decide to adopt fertilizer must learn the names of
different products, their nutrient composition, correct
application rates (based on field characteristics), optimal application schedules, and efficient application
methods. In addition, chemical fertilizer is expensive:
the cost of purchasing chemical fertilizer, transporting
it to the farm, and applying it significantly increases
cash outlays. For these reasons, it is reasonable to
expect that fertilizer is likely to be adopted more
readily by wealthier farmers (who can more easily
afford the cost) and/or better educated farmers who
possess greater technical knowledge and superior
management skills.

In considering the adoption decision, it is important
to keep in mind that there is an interaction between
MV s and fertilizer, so that the benefits of adopting both
technologies exceed the sum of the benefits achieved
by adopting only one or the other.

3. Data
Data on the adoption of MVs and chemical fertilizer were collected through a national survey of maize
growers carried out between November 1997 and
March 1998. A three-stage, clustered, randomized
procedure was used to select a representative sample
of 420 maize farmers located in 60 villages throughout the country. These farmers were questioned at
length about their maize production, consumption,
and marketing practices; their preferences for different maize varietal characteristics; and their knowledge
of and access to improved inputs, such as seed and
fertilizer (for additional details about the survey, see
Morris et al. (1999)).
An impacts study carried out following the termination of the GGDP revealed that both MVs and fertilizer have been adopted less extensively by women
than by men. During the 1997 cropping season, 39.0%
of female farmers planted MVs compared to 59.0%
of male farmers, and 16.2% of female farmers applied
fertilizer to their maize fields compared to 22.5%
of male farmers (Morris et al., 1999). Here, we are
interested in identifying the factors that gave rise to
these observed differences in adoption rates.
Many technology adoption studies distinguish between the rate of adoption (defined as the proportion
of farmers that adopt a given technology, regardless of
the level of use) and the intensity of adoption (defined
in terms of the level of use of the technology, e.g.
the proportion of the farmer's land planted to MV s or
the quantity applied of fertilizer). In Ghana, farmers
who adopt MV s tend to plant them over their entire
landholdings, so the intensity measure usually takes
on a value of either 0 or 100%. The rate of adoption
measure therefore ends up being very similar to the
intensity of adoption measure. In the case of fertilizer, the available data did not enable us to determine
the amount of fertilizer applied by each farmer. For
these reasons, we chose to focus only on rates of
adoption.

4. Adoption model
Maize farmers in Ghana must decide whether to
adopt MVs, fertilizer, or both. The benefits realized
when both technologies are adopted jointly exceed
the sum of the benefits realized when each one is
adopted separately, so the decision to adopt one technology can be expected to affect the decision to adopt
the other. Because the two adoption decisions are
linked, we use a two-stage probit approach. In the
first stage, the full set of estimators is used to predict
the probability of adopting either fertilizer or MVs. In
the second stage, predicted values for MV adoption
and fertilizer adoption are included as independent
variables in the final set of estimations. Consistent
standard errors on the independent variables are
generated using a bootstrapping procedure.
The basic model is specified as follows:
MYadopter = fh X 1 + thfertadopter*
fertadopter = fhX2

+ c: 1

+ ,84MVadopter* +c:2

where MVadopter and fertadopter are dummy variables indicating whether the farmer adopted MV s
and/or fertilizer, X1 and X2 are vectors of variables expected to affect the technology adoption decision, and
MVadopter* and fertadopter* are the predicted values
(generated as described in the preceding paragraph)
of the adoption variables. All of the independent
variables are discussed in detail below.
Dummy variables are included for three ecological
zones in which maize is cultivated: the Coastal Savannah, the transition zone, and the Guinea Savannah
(a fourth zone, the forest zone, serves as the reference). The purpose of the zonal dummy variables is to
control for agro-climatic differences that could affect
the profitability of the technologies. Since the northern part of the country, including virtually all of the
Guinea Savannah zone and portions of the transition
zone, is inhabited mainly by Muslim ethnic groups
among which women tend to be less responsible for
agriculture, the zonal dummy variables may also pick
up some cultural variability, which could be linked to
gender effects.
Several characteristics of the farmer are included
as covariates. The farmer's gender is represented by
a dummy variable. Instead of using the gender of
the household head (the conventional practice in most

31

adoption studies), we use the gender of the farmer.
This allows us to examine the behavior of female farmers in both female- and male-headed households. The
farmer's age is also included, as is the farmer's education, expressed as the number of years of formal
schooling completed.
Included also are several other explanatory variables thought to affect technology adoption decisions
(most of these variables are extensively discussed in
the adoption literature; see Feder et al. (1985) and
Feder and Umali (1993)). The amount of land owned
by the farmer is included, because even though MVs
and fertilizer are both expected to be scale-neutral,
wealthier farmers (i.e. those with more land) are more
likely to be able to afford fertilizer. Since agricultural
extension agents serve as an important source of technical information and improved inputs, the number
of extension visits received by the farmer is expected
to be positively correlated with the probability of
adoption. Market access may also affect the adoption decision, so an index was created to reflect the
level of infrastructure present in the farmer's village
(the index was calculated based on the presence or
absence of a tarred road, a good feeder road, reliable
transportation, and a physical market). Since adopting
a new technology often implies a need for additional
labor, labor availability is frequently associated with
successful adoption. In Model 1, household size is
used as a simple measure of labor availability. The
literature on gender and farming in Africa (see Doss,
1999) suggests that men's labor and women's labor
are not interchangeable, however, so in Model 2, we
account for labor availability by including as separate
explanatory variables the number of adult men, adult
women, and children in the farmer's household.
In addition to the many factors that are expected to
influence adoption of both MV s and fertilizer, certain
technology-specific factors are expected to influence
the two adoption decisions separately. In the case
of MV adoption, varietal choice is expected to be
influenced by the farmer's seed procurement practices. Therefore, in the MV adoption equation, we
include a seed source variable that indicates whether
the seed planted in a given maize field was saved
from the farm or externally acquired (e.g. obtained
from another farmer, from an extension agent, or
from a shop). In the case of fertilizer, the adoption
decision is expected to be influenced by soil fertility

32

C.R. Doss, M.L. Morris I Agricultural Economics 25 (2001) 27-39

considerations. Therefore, in the fertilizer adoption
equation, we include a soil fertility variable based on
the number of years that the field had been continuously cropped. If the field had been fallow prior to
the year of the survey, we use the number of years
that the field had been fallow, so the variable can take
on positive or negative values.

5. Empirical results
Empirical results obtained from estimating Models
1 and 2 are summarized in Table 1. Three aspects of
the results are noteworthy.
First, in both models, the gender variable lacks significant explanatory power. This result is unexpected,
considering that men and women farmers are known
to have adopted the technologies at different rates.
Second, many of the other explanatory variables
have the expected signs and are statistically significant. In the MV adoption equation, ecological zone,
level of education, amount of land owned, number of
extension visits, level of infrastructure, and number
of adult males in the household (Model 2 only) are
positively associated with the probability of adoption.
In the fertilizer adoption equation, ecological zone,
farmer's age, amount of land owned (Model 1 only),
number of extension visits, level of infrastructure, and
the proxy for soil fertility are positively associated
with the probability of adoption.
Third, several of the explanatory variables lack
statistical significance. With the exception of the
coefficient on the number of adult men in the MV
adoption equation, none of the coefficients on the
various measures of labor availability are statistically
significant. This could indicate that labor availability
does not affect MV and fertilizer adoption decisions,
or it could simply mean that the variables we are using
(based on the number of people living in the farmer's
household) are not good indicators of the ability of
Ghanaian farmers to mobilize labor to work in their
maize fields. Somewhat more puzzling, neither of
the estimated coefficients on the (fitted) endogenous
variables shows significant explanatory power, suggesting that MV and fertilizer adoption decisions may
be taken independently, rather than jointly.
As a further test of the significance of gender
on adoption, a likelihood-ratio test statistic was

constructed to test the hypothesis that the coefficient
on female is equal to 0 (Ho: tlfemale = 0). In both
models, the null hypothesis cannot be rejected. This
suggests that controlling for other factors, the adoption of MV s and fertilizer is not associated with the
gender of the farmer.

6. Female-headed households
In Models 1 and 2, the unit of observation is the
farmer, so the analysis focuses on the adoption behavior of individual women and men. This is somewhat
different from the conventional approach; in most
adoption studies, the unit of observation is the household, and gender effects are explored by including a
dummy variable indicating the gender of the household head. One drawback of the conventional approach
is that it does not reveal anything about the behavior of
female farmers who live in male-headed households.
In Ghana, as elsewhere in Africa, these numbers may
be significant. For example, 70% of the female respondents in our sample were married, suggesting that
they may have been living in male-headed households.
Failure to distinguish between the gender of the
farmer and the gender of the household head may represent an important omission, because the constraints
faced by women farmers who live in female-headed
households may be more severe than those faced by
women farmers who live in male-headed households
(see Doss (1999) for a review of the literature on this
issue). 3 A wealth of case study evidence suggests that
female-headed households are less likely to adopt new
technologies than male-headed households (for recent
examples, see Smale et al. (1991) and Kumar (1994)).
In some cases, we may indeed be interested in understanding the adoption decisions of female-headed
households, but here we ask whether the adoption
behavior of female farmers varies depending on the
gender of the head of the household in which they live.
Household decision-making processes vary throughout Ghana and presumably also within our nationally
representative sample. Typically, however, women
3 To further complicate matters, definitions of female-headed
households found in the literature are not consistent. For a good
discussion of the implications of the different definitions, see
Rogers (1995).

farmers take independent decisions regarding the management of agricultural enterprises and the disposal
of revenue earned. Although cash, labor, physical inputs (including seed and fertilizer) and information
may be exchanged within the household, each farmer
tends to act independently, and we would not necessarily expect to see efficient flows of resources and
information (for an example of production losses due
to inefficient factor allocation within the household,
see Udry (1996)).
The data set for Ghana unfortunately does not include information about the gender of the household
head. However, from the available data, it is possible
to infer whether the household in which the farmer
lives is likely to be male-headed or female-headed.
Specifically, it can be assumed that all male farmers
and all married female farmers live in male-headed
households and that all unmarried female farmers live
in female-headed households. 4 Using these assumptions, 25% of the (female) sample farmers living in
female-headed households have adopted MVs, compared to 56% of the (female and male) sample farmers
living in male-headed households. Similarly, 13% of
the (female) sample farmers living in female-headed
households and 22% of the (female and male) sample farmers living in male-headed households have
adopted fertilizer.
In Model 3, we disaggregate the farmers into three
categories: (1) male farmers, all of whom implicitly
live in male-headed households (M/MHH); (2) female
farmers living in male-headed households (F/MHH)
and (3) female farmers living in female-headed households (F/FHH). Within male-headed households, the
MV adoption rate does not differ significantly (in a
statistical sense) between male and female farmers
(Table 1). However, the MV adoption rate for female
farmers living in male-headed households is significantly higher than the rate for female farmers living
in female-headed households. Table 2 presents the
marginal effects; these are negative and relatively
large for female farmers living in female-headed
households. These results indicate that women do not
4 This would count women who report themselves as married but
whose husbands are absent as living in male-headed households.
In addition, if an unmarried woman was living in a household
headed by a man that was not her husband (for example, her
father, brother, or uncle), she would be incorrectly categorized as
living in a female-headed household.

necessarily make different adoption decisions than
men, but they also suggest that there is something
about the structure of female-headed households that
makes farmers living in these households less likely
to adopt MVs. In the case of fertilizer, the adoption decision is affected neither by the gender of
the farmer nor by the gender of the household head
(Table 1).
Likelihood ratio tests can be used to disaggregate the effects of the gender of the farmer from the
gender of the household head. First, we test the hypothesis that there is no effect of gender on adoption
by constraining the coefficients on female farmers
in both male- and female-headed households to be 0
(,BF/MHH = .BF/FHH = 0). This hypothesis is rejected
in the case of MV adoption. Then, we constrain the
coefficients on the gender of the household head to

be the same (tlF/MHH = tlF/FHH = 0), testing the
hypothesis that the gender of the household head is
not significant while controlling for the gender of the
farmer. Again, the hypothesis is rejected in the case
of MV adoption. Finally, we perform a second test
of the hypothesis that the gender of the household
head does not matter by constraining the coefficient
on female farmers in male-headed households to be 0
(tlF/MHH = 0). This test differs from the previous one
in that it does not control for the gender of the farmer.
For the third time, the hypothesis is rejected. Therefore, we conclude that the gender of the household
head does affect MY adoption.
When similar likelihood ratio tests are used to test
the same hypotheses with regard to fertilizer adoption, none of the null hypotheses can be rejected.
This result suggests that controlling for other factors,
gender is not an important determinant of fertilizer
adoption, regardless of whether gender is defined as
the gender of the farmer or gender of the household
head.

7. Access to key inputs and information
The results presented in Table 1 suggest that gender
per se is not significantly associated with MV or fertilizer adoption rates, although the gender of the household head may be important. Based on this finding,
we ask whether gender is linked to factors that indirectly influence adoption behavior. In particular, since
adoption is associated with land ownership, number

of adult men in the farmer's household (MV adoption
only), education, and number of contacts with the
extension service, are these factors correlated with
gender?
Descriptive statistics and simple linear regressions
can help to determine if women and men enjoy
equal access to land, labor, education, and extension
services.

7.1. Land
Wealth is often positively associated with the adoption of new technologies, because wealthier farmers
are better able to bear risk and therefore are more likely
to try new technologies. In rural Ghana, land ownership provides a good measure of wealth. Clearly, there
is some sort of association between land ownership
and gender: women tend to own smaller plots than
men, and a greater proportion of women are landless
(Table 3). Similarly, women tend to cultivate smaller
plots than do men. 5 Female farmers in female-headed
households own and cultivate smaller plots than female farmers in male-headed households. The determinants of land ownership were explored using a to bit
approach. Controlling for the farmer's age, residency
status (native or settler), and marital status, as well as
for ecological zone and level of infrastructure, women
farmers on average were found to have significantly
less access to land (Table 4).
5 The amount of land cultivated by individual farmers reflects
not only their access to land but also their access to the labor
needed to cultivate it.

7.2. Labor

many parts of Africa, men have claim over women's
labor, but women do not have similar claim over men's
labor. Therefore, the data do not allow us to conclude that female farmers have access to male labor;
they simply indicate that the households in which female farmers live include men who could potentially
provide labor.

Throughout many parts of sub-Saharan Africa,
women have greater difficulty than men in obtaining
labor, especially male labor needed for land preparation activities (e.g. clearing, burning, plowing). Within
our sample, women farmers live in households that
contain slightly fewer men on average, except for in
the transition zone (Table 5). Household size varies
by zone, but within zones there do not appear to be
significant differences between the household sizes
of male and female farmers. The data thus suggest
that male and female maize farmers live in households that contain approximately the same number of
adults. Female-headed households have fewer men,
but they still contain some adult men. The data do not
allow us to determine who these men are, but they
may be adult sons.
What these numbers cannot tell us, however, is
whether male and female maize farmers have equal
access to the labor of other household members. In

7.3. Education
Although education is not an input, education
is known to be important in determining farmers'
ability to understand and manage unfamiliar technology. The regression results indicate that education is a significant determinant of MV adoption in
Ghana. Education patterns vary by gender. Female
farmers have less years of schooling, on average,
than male farmers (Table 6). Female farmers in
female-headed households have less years of education than female farmers in male-headed households
(Table 7).

7.4. Extension contacts
The uptake of new technologies is often influenced
by the farmer's contact with extension services, since
extension agents provide improved inputs and technical advice. Within our sample, the frequency of contact with extension agents is strongly associated with
the gender of the farmer. On average, women reported
fewer contacts with extension agents, and a larger proportion of women reported no extension contacts at
all (Table 8). In interpreting the data in Table 8, it is
important to keep in mind that differences in the number of reported contacts with extension agents may not
be attributable to the gender of the farmer but instead
could result from other factors that are correlated with
the gender of the farmer. For example, it is plausible
that extension agents might prefer to visit farmers with
more land, a larger area planted to maize, or those
who have already adopted improved technologies, all
of which happen to be correlated with gender.
On the whole, these findings suggest that male and
female maize farmers in Ghana do not enjoy equal
access to land, education, and agricultural extension
services. The data are less conclusive regarding the
availability of and access to labor, especially male
labor within the household.

37

8. Discussion

In view of this evidence, what can we conclude
about the three questions posed at the beginning of the
paper?
First, in this example involving maize in Ghana,
after we control for farmer's age and level of education, access to land and labor, contact with the extension service, and market access, there is no significant
association between the gender of the farmer and the
probability of adopting MV s or fertilizer. Since men
and women have adopted MV s and fertilizer at different rates, this finding shows the critical importance of
correctly specifying adoption models. Failure to control for gender-linked factors can lead to misleading
conclusions about the importance of gender per se as
an explanatory factor. 6
Second, being a female farmer and living in a
female-headed household affect the adoption decision in quite different ways. Therefore, although
people living in female-headed households are less
likely to adopt new technologies than people living
in male-headed households, this does not necessarily
mean that female farmers are less likely to adopt new
technologies than male farmers. Admittedly, simply
identifying the gender of the household head does
not completely capture what we are interested in,
which is whether women farmers can mobilize the
support of male household members in order to gain
access to resources. However, this information tends
to be difficult to obtain through conventional survey
methods, so gender of the household head is a useful
proxy. 7

6 One caveat should be noted. The sample includes only farmers
who were identified as 'maize farmers'. If either men or women
were disproportionately excluded from the sample because they
were not considered maize farmers, the results could be biased.
The proportion of women farmers in the sample corresponds to
the percentage of women growing maize identified through the
1991-1992 round of the Ghana Living Standard Survey (reported
in Doss (1997)), however, so we believe these results were not
affected by sample selection bias.
7 In some cases, making assumptions about control of resources
based on the gender of the household head can lead to incorrect
conclusions. For example, women farmers frequently report that
their husband is the head of the household, even though he may
live elsewhere and may not be involved in agricultural decisionmaking.

Third, the observed measures of access to land
and number of extension contacts are clearly correlated with gender. However, it is not possible to
determine from the data whether women have access to the same quality of land as men. Nor can it
be determined whether the quantity and/or quality
of information provided by extension workers differ
depending on the gender of the farmer. If women
consistently have access to poor quality land or consistently receive poorer quality extension information,
this would bias our results, in the sense that the effect
of gender would be overstated (i.e. the absolute value
of the estimated coefficient on the gender variable in
an adoption equation would be larger). Conversely,
if women consistently farm better quality land or
consistently receive better extension information, the
effect of gender would be understated. Also, as previously noted, although the number of men in the
household is correlated with MV adoption, simply
counting the number of household members does not
reveal whether women are able to mobilize the labor
that is present in their households to work in their
maize fields. Thus, even though differences can be
observed in access to land, extension visits, and male
household labor, unobserved differences may also
be present, and these unobserved differences may be
as significant or even more significant in influencing
adoption behavior.
On the whole, these results from Ghana suggest that
technology adoption decisions depend primarily on
access to resources, rather than on gender per se. This
conclusion should be interpreted with caution, however, because it does not necessarily mean that MVs
and fertilizer are gender-neutral technologies. If adoption of MVs and/or fertilizer depend on access to land,
labor, or other resources, and if, in a particular context,
men tend to have better access to these resources than
women, then in that context, the technologies will not
benefit men and women equally. Policy changes thus
may be needed to increase women's access to the key
resources; alternatively, it may be desirable to modify
research efforts by deliberately targeting technologies
that are particularly suited for the resources that are
available to women. The bottom line is that it is important to examine both the technology itself and the
physical and institutional context in which the technology is implemented in order to predict whether it will
be adopted successfully by women as well as men.
