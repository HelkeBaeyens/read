ABSTRACT
Peterson, E.W.F., Lan Jin and Ito, S., 1991. An econometric analysis of rice consumption in
the People's Republic of China. Agric. Econ., 6: 67-78.
Rice is the most important staple food in the People's Republic of China (PRC). In many
Asian countries rice appears to have become an inferior good, with income increases
leading to declines in per capita consumption as other food products are substituted for
rice. In this study, human rice consumption is analyzed with a model that allows income
elasticities to vary with income levels. An additional equation accounting for rice disappearance as seed, livestock feed, industrial uses and exports is also estimated. The results of the
analysis indicate that rice has become an inferior good in China and per capita consumption
is likely to decline in the future. Population growth and the growing use of rice for other
purposes means that total rice disappearance will continue to increase although at a rate
that is slower than has historically been the case. The predicted changes in rice consumption
will create pressures to adjust production and trade patterns for rice as well as other
agricultural products.

INTRODUCTION

Almost 80% of the rice produced and consumed in the world is accounted for by six Asian nations, including the People's Republic of China
(PRC), India, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Vietnam and Japan (Ito, 1988). Of
these countries, the PRC is by far the largest producer and consumer of
rice. From 1986 to 1989, average annual rice production in the PRC was
about 120 MMT * (throughout this paper, figures cited for rice consumption
or production are on a milled basis) compared with about 63 MMT for the

same period in India, the second largest producer (USDA, 1990). Most of
the rice produced in the PRC is consumed by households as a staple food.
In recent years, the use of rice for livestock feed has increased. In 1986,
rice fed to livestock made up about 17% of total disappearance compared
with about 13% in the mid 1960's. Human consumption accounts for about
79% of total disappearance with the remainder made up of seed, and
exports (USDA, 1986).
Recent information on the international rice market is presented in
Table 1. The figures for production, exports and imports are averages for
the 4-year period 1986 to 1989. The figures in the table illustrate two
striking features of the world rice market. First, only about 4% of total rice
production is traded compared with over 18% of total wheat production
and almost 13% of maize production. Four countries (PRC, Thailand,
Pakistan and the U.S.) account for more than two-thirds of total rice trade
and in three (Thailand, Pakistan and the U.S.), a large share (31.3% to
56.8%) of national production is exported. The second feature shown by
the figures in Table 1 is the importance of the PRC in world rice
production. Because exports account for less than one percent of production and the PRC holds virtually no stocks, internal rice utilization is

approximately equal to production with both amounting to about 37% of
the corresponding world totals. Clearly, relatively small changes in production or consumption in the PRC could have an important effect on the
world market. For example, a 1% fall in internal utilization coupled with a
1% increase in production could add more than 2 MMT of rice (more than
15% of current exports) to the present level of Chinese exports. A change
of this magnitude would have important repercussions for producers in
such exporting nations as Thailand or the United States.
The purpose of this study is to examine the likely evolution of rice
consumption in the PRC. Total rice disappearance can be divided into
human consumption and consumption for other purposes including livestock feed, seed, industrial uses and exports. Although human rice consumption accounts for most of the total disappearance, the amount of rice
consumed for other purposes is substantial and has been growing in recent
years. Consequently, it is necessary to account for both of these elements in
assessing the likely evolution of rice consumption in the PRC. In the next
section, models of per capita human rice consumption and consumption of
rice for other purposes are described and estimated. These models are
then used to project Chin~se rice consumption to the year 2000. In the
concluding section, the results of the analysis and their implications for
world trade in rice are summarized.
RICE CONSUMPTION IN THE PRC

In a study of rice consumption in 14 Asian countries, Ito et al. (1989)
found that income elasticities of demand have declined in recent years in
many of these countries and, in several, have become negative. Their
results for the PRC indicate that rice is still a normal good although the
income elasticity of demand appears to have declined in recent years.
Other analysts have pointed to apparent changes in Chinese food consumption patterns (Sicular, 1985; Crook, 1987; Tuan, 1987). As in most Asian
countries, rice consumption in the PRC is quite high compared with other
regions of the world, and it is likely that most Chinese households will
allocate any additional income earned to foods other than rice, notably
meat and dairy products.
If the income elasticity of demand for rice in the PRC has become
negative, it is likely that per capita rice consumption will decline in the
future as incomes continue to grow. China has experienced rapid economic
growth since economic reforms were initiated in the late 1970's. The World
Bank has projected average annual growth in per capita income of between
3.5% and 5.5% over the next 10-15 years (World Bank, 1985). Increases of
this nature coupled with negative income elasticities mean significant

70

declines in per capita rice consumption. Whether these declines lead to
large exportable surpluses of rice depends on the way in which rice
production and total population evolve. If population growth is high
enough, the fall in per capita consumption may be offset and total rice
consumption may actually increase. In addition, adjustments in production
or increased use of rice as livestock feed could reduce the amounts
available for export.
To account for these various influences on rice disappearance, it is
useful to estimate separate equations for human consumption and for rice
used for other purposes. In addition, human rice consumption should be
estimated on a per capita basis to allow an assessment of the potentially
conflicting effects of population and income growth. Finally, on the basis of
previous results, it is important to model human demand in a manner that
allows the income elasticities to vary with the level of income. The
log-inverse-log model used by Ito et al. (1989) is an appropriate representation of the relationships to be analyzed:
(1)
where X is per capita consumption, Y is real per capita income, and a, b
and c are coefficients to be estimated. This can also be written as;
log X= a - by- 1 - c log Y

(2)

The first derivative of X with respect to Y is (bjY 2 - cjY)X. This
derivative is positive if b jY is larger than c and negative if b jY is smaller
than c.The income elasticity of demand derived from equations (1) or (2)
is:
N=bjY-c
As required for this study, this income elasticity varies with the level of
income and becomes negative when incomes increase to the point where·
the expression b jY is less than c. Ito et al. (1989) used cross-section,
time-series analysis to estimate income elasticities of demand for the PRC
and 13 other Asian countries. Their results indicated that the income
elasticity of demand in the PRC declined from 0.42 in 1961 to 0.13 in 1984.
In this study, time-series data are used to analyze the relationship and
different price variables from the ones used by Ito et al. (1989) are
included. In addition, human consumption is used as the dependent
variable rather than total disappearance as in the study by Ito et al. (1989).
Aside from human consumption, the principal use of rice is for livestock
feed. Over 90% of the meat consumed in the PRC is pork although poultry
and dairy production are also significant livestock enterprises (World Bank,
1987). Industrial livestock production based on scientifically compounded

71

RICE CONSUMPTION IN CHINA

feeds is fairly limited but large quantities of locally produced grains and
grain by-products are fed to barnyard animals in traditional husbandry
systems. Southern China, the main rice producing region, is also a leading
hog production area (World Bank, 1987). The amount of rice used for feed
is influenced by livestock populations, notably those of hogs and poultry,
and the intensity of feeding. Another variable that may influence the use of
rice as feed is the price of maize, the main substitute for rice in livestock
rations. Thus, a measure of livestock numbers and maize prices are
important explanatory variables in accounting for the consumption of rice
for purposes other than direct human consumption. The model estimated
for this study also includes rice acreage because the amount of rice used
for seed depends on acreage and seed use is included in the dependent
variable. The final specification, thus, includes rice acreage, total consumption of pork and poultry as a proxy for livestock numbers, and real maize
prices as explanatory variables.
Most of the data used in this study are from the Statistical Yearbook of
China and cover the period 1960-1986. National income, defined in the
PRC as the value of production excluding the government sector, the
Chinese general index of retail prices (1950 = 100) used to deflate the
income and some of the price variables, retail pork prices, producer prices
for maize, rice acreage, and population are all taken from this source. In
the absence of reliable data on retail wheat and rice prices, world prices as
reported by the IMP are used. Data on rice consumption are from USDA
(1986). The equation for per capita human consumption also includes a
dummy variable for the years 1978-1986 to test the hypothesis that the
agricultural reforms begun in 1978 have had an effect on rice consumption
patterns. The equation was estimated with ordinary least squares and is
shown below with the t-ratios in parentheses.

where RC is per capita rice consumption (kg), PCY real per capita income

prices, and D is a dummy variable for the reform years 1978-86.
The results reported in equation (3) show a strong relationship between
income and consumption. Both income coefficients are significant and of
the expected sign. The price of pork is also significant suggesting a
cross-price demand elasticity of 0.75. This result supports the argument

72

that high quality food products such as meat are being substituted for rice.
The coefficient of the price ratio for grain is not significantly different from
zero. This is not surprising given the extensive government control of these
markets in China. Guaranteed rations of staple foods have historically been
available to all consumers, and prices have been strictly controlled by the
government. It is interesting to note that the dummy variable is significantly different from zero. This suggests that there has been a change in
the relationships as a result of the economic reforms launched in 1978. In
general, the model performs very well in predicting the historical level of
per capita rice consumption as can be seen in Table 1. Overall, equation (3)
appears to be a reliable representation of the determinants of per capita
rice demand.
Equation (3) can be used to chart the evolution of income elasticities in
the PRC. These historical elasticities are shown in Table 2. The results
indicate that income elasticities declined throughout the 1960's and 1970's,
turning negative in the early 1980's. By 1986, the estimated elasticity had
fallen to - 0.15.
The equation accounting for other uses of rice was also estimated with
ordinary least squares:

R 2 = 0.95
p = -0.395(1.97)
where ou is rice consumed as feed, seed, exports and industrial usages
(1000 metric tonnes); MU rice area (1000 hectares); RM pork and poultry
consumption (100 million jin *); and Pco real producer price for corn in
the PRC (yuanjjin *). Equation (4) has been corrected for first-order
autocorrelation (p = - 0.395). The signs of all coefficients are as expected
and significantly different from zero at the 5% level of confidence with the
exception of the coefficient for real corn prices.
A more sophisticated model of the Chinese rice market would include
simultaneous equations for supply, demand and trade. The relatively simple model presented above can be justified by noting the nature of the
market. Historically, the state has exercised almost complete control over
production, prices and distribution of rice (Ash, 1988). Although the
agricultural reforms have allowed some private trade, government intervention is still pervasive. Under these conditions, it is reasonable to model

consumption separately from production, trade and stocks. In addition, the
quality of the data available may be such that more complicated specifications would add little to the explanatory power of the model. The two
equations estimated for this study predict the historical evolution of the
two dependent variables quite accurately (Table 2) and appear to represent
the relationships of interest reasonably well. In the next section they are
used to project rice disappearance to the year 2000.
PROJECTIONS OF CHINESE RICE CONSUMPTION

The first step in projecting human rice consumption in China is to
develop predictions of the likely evolution of real income. Real per capita
income has grown at an average annual rate of about 7% in the 1980's.
These high rates of growth are not likely to be sustained in the 1990's.
Rapid economic growth in recent years has led to inflationary pressures
and the government is working to slow growth rates. For the purposes of

this study, two income scenarios were adopted. Both reflect the expectation
that income growth rates will decline. In the first, the current rate of 7% is
maintained into the early 1990's, after which it falls to 5.5% from 1992-96
and 4.5% from 1997-2000. The low growth scenario uses rates of 5.0%,
4.0% and 3.5% for the same periods. The two income levels and the
associated income elasticities of demand are shown for selected years in
Table 3.
Population is the other variable affecting total human consumption.
Because the population of China is very large, small differences in growth
rates could lead to large differences in the absolute number of people. The
World Bank has projected population in China to the year 2000. Their
projections may underestimate population growth in China because individuals born in the baby boom of the 1960's are now entering the reproductive years. In addition, programs to control rural population growth have
not been very effective and the new income streams resulting from the
changes in agricultural policies make it easier for rural families to support
additional children (Lan, 1989). For this study, two population growth
paths are assumed. The first allows population to grow at 2.0% per year
from 1987 to 1992 and at 1.8% from 1993 to 2000. This leads to a higher
predicted population in the year 2000 than that predicted by the World
Bank. The second population growth path is based on the assumption that
population grows at 1.8% per year until 1992 with the annual growth rate
falling to 1.5% thereafter. The two population projections are shown for
1990, 1995 and 2000 in Table 3. Both of them indicate that the Chinese
population will surpass 1.3 billion by the year 2000.
The income and population projections give rise to four possible combinations. Only two of these, low population growth coupled with high
income growth and high population growth along with low income growth,
are reported in Table 4. The other combinations lead to results between
the extremes generated by these two growth profiles (Lan, 1989). As shown

in Table 4, relatively rapid growth in real income leads to a fall of around
13% in annual per capita rice consumption from 91 kg in 1990 to just under
80 kg in 2000. Despite the decline in per capita consumption, population
grows sufficiently, even on the basis of the low population growth projection, to induce a slight increase in total consumption over this period.
Projected total consumption in 2000, however, is only 1.9% higher than the
1990 level because of the lower population growth assumptions. If the
income growth assumptions are retained but even lower population growth
rates are assumed, total consumption could even begin to decline. For
example, if the average annual population growth rate is 1.5% for the
entire period between 1988 and 2000, total population will just barely reach
1.3 billion in 2000 and total rice consumption (at 103.2 MMT) would be a
fraction lower than the predicted level for 1990.
For the other scenario, high population growth rates are combined with
low income growth. Annual per capita rice consumption falls less rapidly to
about 85 kg in 2000 and the higher assumed population growth leads to an
increase in total human consumption between 1990 and 2000 of 9.6%. The
two scenarios shown in Table 4 can be taken to represent upper and lower
bounds for total human rice consumption in the PRC. Other assumptions
about income and population growth would generally fall between these
two extremes. Based on these results it appears that total rice consumption
by the human population will grow between 2% and 10% over the next
decade. In contrast, if one assumes that the level of annual per capita rice
consumption in 2000 remains at the 1986 figure of 93 kg, total human
consumption would be between 124 and 128 MMT depending on the

assumptions on population growth compared with the range of 106-117
MMT projected for the year 2000 in this study.
To project the disappearance of rice for other uses, it is necessary to
predict values for the explanatory variables. The projections for rice
acreage and pork and poultry consumption are based on time trends while
the real price of corn was held constant at its average value between 1981
and 1985. The projected explanatory variables are shown in Table 5 along
with projections of rice consumption for other purposes and total rice
disappearance. Total rice disappearance includes human consumption and
other uses of rice. In the low population growth/high income growth
scenario, total disappearance increases by 6.2% from an estimated volume
of 128.4 MMT in 1990 to 136.4 MMT in the year 2000. In the scenario
coupling high population growth with low income growth, total disappearance increases from 131.3 to 147.5 MMT, an increase of 12.3%. Again, using
the 1986 figure for per capita consumption (93 kg) would lead to much
higher predictions for total rice consumption, ranging from 155 to 159 MMT.
To understand the implications of these results, it is helpful to consider
some independent projections of Chinese rice production. The World
Bank, for example, has predicted annual increases of 1.8%. If these
increases are realized over the coming decade, total milled production
would reach about 155 MMT in the year 2000. On the basis of the results
presented in this study, this production estimate implies an exportable

that milled production would reach 187.6 MMT by the year 2000. The
exportable surplus would be even larger if this prediction is realized. Note
that predictions based on relatively constant levels of per capita consumption would seriously underestimate the potential excess supply. Using the
1986 figure for per capita consumption, the World Bank production projections and the levels of rice disappearance for other uses predicted in this
study, Chinese rice disappearance would be approximately equal to availability in 2000. This shows the importance of allowing income elasticities of
demand to vary with the level of income.
CONCLUSION

The results set out above are not derived from a complete model with
endogenous production and government policy. As the predicted slowing in
the growth of total human rice consumption becomes apparent, producers
and the Chinese government can be expected to react in some way to the
changes in consumption patterns. Policies designed to increase rice production may need to be modified in light of these changes. As consumers
allocate greater proportions of their growing budgets to high quality
products such as meat and dairy products, demand for feed grains can be
expected to grow. Given the size of the world rice market (see Table 1),
strategies based on trading growing excess supplies of rice for imported
feed grains do not appear promising. Any sustained increase in the level of
rice exports by the PRC is likely to depress world rice prices quite
substantially, worsening the PRC's terms of trade. A more promising
strategy may be to adopt policies that encourage feed grain production at
the expense of further increases in rice production. Alternatively some of
the current rice acreage could be shifted to rice varieties particularly
suitable for feeding livestock. Reactions of this nature are likely to result in
lower production levels than predicted by the World Bank and actual
exportable surpluses will almost certainly be much less than the quantities
indicated in the previous section.
Other implications of the changing consumption patterns in the PRC are
more difficult to detail. In a less regulated market, the slower growth in
demand would cause rice prices to decline relative to the price of other
goods, benefiting low-income consumers and providing the incentives to
re-allocate resources from rice production to feed grain and livestock
production. In the PRC, the effects may be to encourage production of
livestock products, vegetables and other foods for the small free market
instituted as part of the agricultural reform. Rice grown in the northern
parts of the PRC on land more suited to wheat cultivation may be replaced

with that crop. Thus, the market for wheat, as well as those for feed grains
and livestock products may be affected by the predicted changes. Much will
depend on the response of the government to these changes and the types
of price policies implemented.
Finally, slower growth in the demand for rice in the PRC will have an
impact on world markets for rice, feed grains and, perhaps, livestock
products and wheat. The PRC could potentially become the leading rice
exporting country if falling consumption leads to increased exports. It could
also become an important market for feed grains if land is not shifted from
rice production to feed grain production. Because per capita consumption
of rice is likely to fall as incomes increase, the future growth in total rice
consumption is likely to be lower than what many planners had expected.
This prediction is particularly important in a country where markets cannot
be expected to guide the allocation of resources toward production of other
crops and livestock products for which demand is likely to increase.
