Abstract
This paper presents a bio-economic model of Andit Tid, a severely degraded crop-livestock farming system with high
population density and good market access in the highlands of Ethiopia. Land degradation, population growth, stagnant
technology, and drought threaten food security in the area. Drought or weather risk appears to have increased in recent years.
The bio-economic model is used to analyse the combined effects of land degradation, population growth, market imperfections
and increased risk of drought on household production, welfare and food security. We find that the indirect effects of drought
on household welfare through the impact on crop and livestock prices are larger than the direct production effects of drought.
Provision and adoption of credit for fertiliser, although risky in itself, may lead to increased grain production and improved
household welfare and food security. Provision of credit may have a negative effect on conservation incentives but this effect
may be mitigated by linking a conservation requirement to the provision of credit for fertiliser.

1. Introduction
Land degradation, poverty and food insecurity are
pervasive and interconnected problems in Ethiopia.
Stochastic rainfall causes severe droughts at irregular intervals and these droughts threaten the lives and
livelihoods of millions of people. Policies and technologies that can contribute to increased food production and improved food security are badly needed.

There is a growing interest in using bio-economic
models as a tool for policy analysis in order to better
understand pathways of development2 and to assess
the impact of alternative policies on the natural resource base and human welfare. One of the potential
great benefits of these models is that they can provide
an improved and more comprehensive indication of
the feedback effects between human activity and natural resources. Modern computer power permits the

of change (or stagnation) in agriculture and livelihood strategies,
associated with causal and conditioning factors (Pender et al.,

development of complex models far beyond what was
possible only a few years ago. It has therefore become
possible to make models that are theoretically more
consistent and empirically more accurate.
The novelty of the model presented here is that
it is a dynamic non-separable household model that
simultaneously integrates economic optimisation in
production and consumption with inter-temporal environmental feedbacks, allowing for non-linearities
in constraints as well as the objective function. Some
other bio-economic models have not been truly dynamic because they have incorporated future impacts
through sustainability constraints or user costs only
(Holden, 1993a,b; Kruseman, 2000; Shiferaw and
Holden, 1999, 2000). This model is dynamic, the
households maximise discounted utility over a limited
time horizon.
Market imperfections and heterogeneity of resources across households in the study area cause
land use at the plot level to depend on household
resources (Holden et al., 2001). Models are therefore
developed for different household categories. The
models are calibrated and aggregated to resemble the
actual pattern of household interactions through their
participation in imperfect factor and output markets.
These market imperfections include limited access
to off-farm employment, price bands for outputs and
labour, a constrained rental market for land through
share tenancy, oxen rental market through exchange
with labour only, constrained access to formal credit
in kind (for fertiliser) or to informal credit at a high
interest rate.
This version of the model also incorporates risk
averse behaviour through a constant partial relative
risk aversion utility function, production risk due to
drought, and downside risk aversion to taking credit
for fertiliser. Drought also affects prices for crops and
livestock and price expectations and these have additional effects on household production and welfare.
Earlier optimisation models were also criticised for
being linear while the reality they were supposed to
represent was highly non-linear. While piece-wise linear representations of non-linear relationships may
serve as good and efficient approximations, recent advances that allow for large non-linear optimisation
models increase credibility.
Like the Ginchi model (Okumu et al., 1999, 2000),
this model endogenises the effects of land degradation

in the form of soil erosion and nutrient depletion. The
availability of biophysical data from conservation experiments in the study area allows us to estimate erosion rates as well as crop productivity responses on
different soils in the study area. The model furthermore integrates crop and livestock interactions. Crop
choice, building or removal of conservation structures
on different types of land as well as fertiliser and manure use are endogenous decisions that affect the rate
ofland degradation. These decisions affect erosion and
nutrient depletion rates that determine crop productivity in later years.
Agricultural production takes place in two cropping seasons per year, the meher and belg seasons.
Recently, the belg season rains have failed in several
consecutive years, which was rare in the past. The objective of this article is to analyse the implications of
this new increased production risk using the dynamic
bio-economic model. Specifically, we assess:
(a) how risk of drought in combination with land
degradation and population growth affects household production, income, welfare and food security; and
(b) the impact of credit for fertiliser on household
welfare, food security, incentives to conserve land
and soil erosion.
In Section 2 of the paper, we give a brief description of the case study area. The basic structure of the
bio-economic model is outlined in Section 3, followed
by a discussion of the methodology of bio-economic
modelling in Section 4. The results and discussion are
presented in Section 5, followed by the conclusion.

2. Description of the case study area and data
Andit Tid is located approximately 60 km north of
Debre Berhan, along the main road between Addis
Ababa and the Tigray Region, in North Shewa in the
Central Ethiopian Highlands. This implies that the
market access is fairly good. The area is classified as
belonging to the low potential cereal-livestock zone
and is severely degraded. It is a high altitude area
(>3000 m.a.s.l.). The land is located in two altitude
zones; dega zone ( <3200 m.a.s.l.) and wurch zone
(>3200m.a.s.l.). The average rainfall is 1336mm per
year distributed over two growing seasons, the meher

season from June to November and the belg season
from January to May. Droughts have not been common in the area until very lately, when the belg rains
have failed in two consecutive years (1999 and 2000).
Hailstorms and frost have, however, commonly damaged crops.
The two dominant soil types are andosols and
regosols. Andosols dominate in the wurch zone w~ile
regosols dominate in the dega zone. Andosols are nch
in organic matter due to the high elevation. The grass
turf is collected in heaps and burnt3 before planting
of barley. This releases nutrients for the crop but also
causes considerable losses of organic matter and soil
nitrogen. Yohannes (1989) estimated 75% of the land
to be on steep slopes (>25% slope). Soil erosion rates
in the area are very high and a large share of the land is
shallow, causing reduction of soil depth to affect crop
rooting depth and thus yields (Shiferaw and Holden,
2001). Holden and Shiferaw (2000) estimated 21%
of the agricultural land to be shallow ( <30 em soil
depth) and 48% to be of medium depth (30-60 em)
(Table 1). Based on the survey data, we divided land
into eight land classes for our modelling (Table 2).
Various forms of conservation technologies are
common in the area. They have partly been introduced
through external food-for-work programs. Exogenously introduced conservation structures have later
been partly removed by the farmers. Shiferaw and
Holden (1998) found that human population pressure
(land scarcity) increased the probability that conservation structures were partly or fully removed. The

reasons for this were thought to be that the conservation structures did not contribute to increased yields
in the short run, the structures occupied some land
and therefore reduced the effective planting area, and
the structures collected fertile soils that could be used
to increase short run production by dismantling the
structures and spreading out the soil collected there.
The structures could also harbour rats that might
damage crops.
The main crop in the area is barley, followed by
wheat, horse bean and field pea. Lentils and linseeds
are also commonly grown. Most crop production takes
place in the dega zone but barley is also grown in
the wurch zone in the belg season. The high elevation
prevents production of other crops in this zone. .
Cattle and sheep are the dominant types of livestock, but goats, equines and chicken are also common (Table 2). The animal population density is very
high in the area; Yohannes (1989) estimated it to be
1.48 tropical livestock units per hectare (TLU/ha)
against 0.36 as the average for the Ethiopian highlands
(Table 3). We found this density to have increased to
2.03 TLU/ha in 1998 but it declined to 1.71 TLU/ha
by the end of 1999 due to the drought (Holden and
Shiferaw, 2000).
The human population density was estimated to be
145.5 persons/km2 in 1986 against the average of 61
persons/km2 for the Ethiopian highlands (Yohannes,
1989). The population density was 230 persons!km 2
cultivable land. The population growth rate was estimated to be 3% per year, indicating that population
pressure in the area is increasing.
Production of crops and livestock are well integrated
in the area. Oxen are the dominant source of traction
power. Hand cultivation is used only on very steep
slopes inaccessible by oxen. Animal manure is used
for fuel or as fertiliser on crops. Sale of animals is an
important source of cash income. Crop residues are
used as animal fodder. Fodder is otherwise obtained
from fallow land and grazing land but only a small
share of this (5%) is from communal land. There is,
however, free grazing outside the cropping season and
this may create incentives for overstocking of animals.
Fodder shortage is an important constraint and purchase of fodder and the use of cut and carry system
are the main strategies to overcome this problem besides limiting the number of animals kept (Holden and
Shiferaw, 2000).

The land resources (land of different qualities) are
fairly evenly distributed among households in the area
due to the land reform and frequent land redistributions whereby land was allocated to households based
on household size. Livestock wealth is therefore a better indicator of household wealth and wealth differentiation. Particularly oxen ownership signifies the farming capacity of households as the rental market for

oxen (ploughing) is imperfect (Holden and Shiferaw,
2000). It also leads to the typical pattern where households without oxen rent out land to households with
two oxen or more, while households with one ox exchange oxen among themselves.
Land renting typically takes the form of share tenancy, where the share to the owner varies between 0.5
and 0.25 depending on land quality. Households may
have access to credit in kind for purchase of fertilisers
but are reluctant to take this credit even though it appears profitable. Production and market risk and high
aversion to these types of risk cause households to be
reluctant to buy fertiliser on credit.
Households have limited access to off-farm income
sources and crop production is highly subsistence oriented, but the trend during the last 20 years has been
from households being net sellers of food grains to
now being net buyers. The recent droughts have even
transformed the area to become dependent on food aid
(Holden and Shiferaw, 2000).

Plot level data were collected by visiting and measuring (by triangulation) and observing all plots and
by interviewing the households owning or renting
the plots. Table 1 summarises the plot level data by
soil/climatic zone and soil depth.
Erosion rates were estimated based on experiments
carried out by SCRP4 over many years in the study
site. Yield responses were estimated based on SCRP
experimental data for conservation technology responses, and based on FAO fertiliser experiments
and local crop-fertiliser demonstration plots managed
by the extension system. A comprehensive analysis
of some of these data is presented in Shiferaw and
Holden (2001).
Socio-economic data were collected in household
surveys in 1986, 1994, 1998 and 2000. The three
last surveys were carried out by the authors. These
data were used to structure and calibrate the bio-economic models for the different household categories
(Tables 1-3). Prices from 1997 (normal year) and 1999
(drought year) (Table 4) were used to construct expected prices based on the probability of drought.

3. The bio-economic model
Earlier versions of this model include Shiferaw et al.
(2000, 2001). The main expansion of the model pre4 Soil Conservation Research Project (SCRP) was funded by
the Swiss government and carried out soil conservation research
in selected sites in the Ethiopian highlands from 1981 to the
mid-1990s.

sented here is the introduction of risk due to stochastic rainfall, a better representation of the market imperfections found in the area, a better calibration of
the model to the actual conditions in the area based
on new survey data (Holden and Shiferaw, 2000), and
numerous minor adjustments improving the theoretical consistency of the model and its validity in terms
of its ability to replicate current and recent land use
and household welfare in the study area.
A simple conceptual representation of the model is
presented in Fig. 1. A more detailed technical description is given in Appendix A. Households maximise
their welfare (measured as utility of certainty equivalent full income) subject to numerous constraints. The
model is dynamic and non-linear. For example, land
degradation in form of soil erosion and nutrient depletion is endogenous as it is affected by household production and investment decisions. Furthermore, soil
erosion affects soil depth which in turn affects yields
and output in following years that again affect income and welfare. Weather risk affects production
as well as prices and this may again affect production decisions. Households make production decisions

based on expectations about prices and output and
the risk involved. Imperfections in markets (limited
access, high transaction costs) affect production decisions and cause non-separability of production and
consumption decisions. Population growth affects both
the labour force and household welfare as more people have to share the outcome of a constant land area
that also is affected by land degradation. This leads
to a Malthusian development path when technology,
prices and other exogenous factors are constant. This
poverty-environment trap can only be broken through
availability of new technologies, improved access to
markets and better investment opportunities.

4. Methodology
Holden et al. (200 1) found that market imperfections in the study area affected land use and plot level
land productivity and this has implications for how
units for bio-economic modelling were identified.
These findings indicate that aggregate bio-economic
models at watershed and/or community levels would
fail to address issues related to social differentiation
and its impact on land use. Watershed or community
level bio-economic models typically rely on perfect
market assumptions and separability of production

decisions from consumption decisions or on egalitarian distribution of resources and equal market access
within communities. 5 These assumptions do not fit
well with empirical reality in the Ethiopian highlands
in general and the case study area in particular. It
appears more appropriate to model land use decisions
at the household group level, and to aggregate from
(uniform) household groups to the community or watershed levels afterwards. However, our approach does
not capture explicit spatial issues such as the close
neighbour effects of conservation decisions (spatial
ex ternali ties).
Household group modelling and aggregation requires proper weighting and calibration of the different models to satisfy local demand and supply
equations. It is assumed that population growth takes
place by growth of average household size for the different household groups. The share of households in
the different household groups may change over time,
however, and this must be adjusted during aggregation in later years. Alternatively, farm sizes could be
adjusted down if fragmentation of land holdings or

5 The land reform in Ethiopia resulted in an egalitarian land
distribution in most communities. However, distribution of household labour and livestock, especially oxen used for traction, is less
equally distributed.

land redistributions takes place. 6 We have calibrated
the model to fit the actual land sizes after the latest
land redistribution in 1997 in the study area. Farm
sizes are based on actually measured plots. Measured
farm sizes turned out to be on average 30% larger
than reported by farmers.
Collective action and open access resources or common property regimes may potentially be important in
relation to the focus of our study. In our study area,
most of the land has been divided and distributed to
individual households. Only a small share of the fodder resources come from communal and open access
land. There is also very little collective action in the
area. We therefore think that the errors we commit by
treating these supplies as exogenous in the model are
small.
The model is validated by comparison of base runs
with actual survey data for key output variables for the
different household groups (Table 5).7 The model is
constructed in GAMS. A 5-year model contains about
39,600 variables and 23,300 equations, many of which
are non-linear.

6 As our model only has a time horizon of 5 years these problems
are not considered important for our analysis.
7 Eucalyptus was not included in the 5-year model presented in
this paper. We have run other models, for longer time periods, that
include eucalyptus, but have not included these in this paper due
to size constraints. There were no meaningful changes in cropping
pattern over the 5-year period and we have therefore not included
information on these changes.

5. Results and discussion
5.1. Land degradation, crop productivity and
impact of conservation technologies
Fig. 2 shows the yield trends over 5 years of barley on regosols on the four different land classes with
and without conservation technologies when no fertiliser or manure is applied. Yields are shown for the
cases when conservation structures do not reduce initial yields and when initial yields are affected negatively. We see that yields are lowest and decline most
rapidly on shallow and steep soils.
In Fig. 3, the decline in yields of barley over a
5-year period on regosols in the meher season and on
andosols in the belg season, with and without conservation technologies and without and with a fairly
high level of fertiliser application, are shown. We see
that yields decline slightly faster on andosols than on
regosols, faster on un-conserved than on conserved
land, faster on shallow soils and steep slopes, and
faster when no fertiliser is used. Yields decline even
on deeper soils that are conserved and receive a high
level of fertiliser (55 kg Nand 50 kg P205 per ha) because conservation does not eliminate soil erosion and
a marginal reduction in rooting depth reduces yields.

5.2. The impacts of drought

welfare, income per capita, crop sale, risk premium,

on farm labour and credit demand are presented in
Table 6 for the two oxen household group. The effect of providing credit for fertiliser (unconstrained)
is compared to the case when credit access is constrained. The models have been run for 10 and 20%
risk of drought. We see that households with access
to credit to some extent compensate for the increasing
risk of drought by reallocating their production such
that crop sales are lower in good years (no drought)
to reduce the need to buy crops (food) in case of
drought. Without access to credit households are less
able to do this and even become net buyers of crops
in good years after a few years due to land degradation and population growth. Provision of credit
and fertiliser supply may therefore to some extent
reduce the need for food aid in drought years. Credit
and fertiliser use helps also to better sustain household welfare while the development path is clearly
Malthusian without access to credit for fertiliser
(Table 6).

There are both direct and indirect effects of drought.
First, there is a direct production effect as crop production is reduced due to drought. The belg season
drought has been so severe that no crops could be
produced in this season. This production loss is therefore equal to the total belg season crop production in
good years. The fact that the drought strikes over a
larger geographical area leads to indirect price effects.
Obviously, crop prices will increase in drought years
and households are typically net buyers of crops in
such years. This implies that they have to buy crops
at a higher price. In addition, livestock prices decline
when the drought is severe as people are forced to sell
animals to buy food. This leads to a livestock value
loss. We incorporated these losses in the model with
and without access to credit and with a 10% risk of
drought. The results are presented in Table 7. We see
that the production loss is higher with access to credit
because fertiliser is used on barley in the belg season
in good years (no drought). The production loss tends

to decline over years due mainly to crop productivity loss. The loss due to the need to buy cereals for
food in drought years increases over time, however,
and is not much different with or without access to
credit for fertiliser. Livestock value losses decline over
time as the number of animals declines over time. The
total loss is around 80% of the poverty line income
when credit access is constrained and even higher
when credit for fertiliser is used. The direct production loss is 30--40% of the total loss without access to
credit and is 40-50% of the total loss with access to
credit.

5.3. Impact of credit on conservation incentives
The model includes both the options of removal
of conservation structures and of building new conservation structures and there is a labour requirement
for maintaining conservation structures. Earlier versions of our model were used to test how credit access
and fertiliser use affected incentives to conserve land
(Shiferaw et al., 2001). In Table 8, we present new results on this for the case in which conservation technologies do not reduce initial yields. The table shows
that the total erosion (tons of soil per farm) is higher

after provision of credit as the area conserved is lower,
particularly in the initial years. The proportion of total
land conserved increases from 39 to 64% when there
is no access to credit and from 29 to 62% with access to credit. There is some removal of conservation
structures in the terminal year.
In Table 9, we look at the case in which conservation structures reduce initial yields. Here we look
at the impact of credit as well as the impact of linking access to credit to a conservation requirement for
land where fertiliser is used. We see that erosion rates
are higher when initial yields are reduced by conservation structures. More labour is used for removal of
conservation structures in the initial year. Provision of
credit does not increase erosion as much in the case
in which conservation structures reduce initial yields,
because conservation structures are also removed in
the credit constrained case. Imposing an interlinkage
(cross-compliance) policy that credit for fertiliser only
is available for conserved land, reduces erosion levels
by 5-15%. The reduction is largest in the initial years
as less conservation structures are removed and more
new structures are built. Household welfare is reduced
to some extent by the interlinkage policy and total
labour requirement is increased in the initial years.
Household welfare improves considerably compared
to the credit constrained case, however.
An important policy question is how easy or difficult it is to implement this type of interlinkage policy.
There are extension agents in Andit Tid and they are
already involved in promoting fertiliser use through
organising demonstration plots in farmers' fields. It is
therefore relatively easy for them to administer such
a cross-compliance requirement. The extension agent
in the area told us that he only gave fertiliser credit
for use on flat and good soils. Few households dared
to take credit for fertiliser, however, due to the risk
involved. This special credit risk aversion appeared to
be due to bad experience in the past when the punishment for failing to repay credit was quite severe.

in the belg season. We have developed a model to
assess the impacts of the drought on household production and welfare. We use the model to assess both
the direct production losses and the indirect losses due
to price changes for crops and livestock. Households
will need to buy cereals at a high price in drought
years to meet their food needs and/or they depend
on food aid. Land degradation and population growth
increase the need to purchase food over time, and the
area has changed from being a surplus producer to
a net buyer of cereals. Furthermore, severe drought
causes livestock prices to decline. As livestock is the
most important form of wealth that households have,
this indirect effect of drought is considerable. Alternative forms of storage of wealth, e.g. bank savings,
should be promoted.
We find that provision of credit for fertiliser may increase barley production considerably and make more
households surplus producers of grains, at least in
years when drought does not occur. As much of the
barley is produced in the belg season, provision of
credit for fertiliser does not reduce much the need to
purchase cereals in drought years. Higher production
in good years may, however, make households more
able to cope with drought year losses. The decline in
household welfare over time may also be reduced by
provision of credit for fertiliser.
Provision of credit for fertiliser has a negative effect
on incentives to conserve land and this causes erosion
rates to be higher when credit is provided. In the case
when conservation structures reduce initial yields it
may be useful to interlink provision of credit for fertiliser to a conservation requirement as this may create additional incentives to conserve land and reduce
erosion rates.
Overall, even the combination of conservation structures and high levels of fertiliser use cannot sustain
crop yields as erosion cannot be eliminated and soils
in the area are shallow. Technical change, population
control, better access to off-farm employment and out
migration are necessary to avoid starvation or chronic
dependence on food aid in the future.

6. Conclusions
We have developed a bio-economic model for a
severely degraded area with high population density
and good market access in the Ethiopian highlands.
The area has recently been exposed to severe droughts

The basic theoretical structure of the model follows.
The household model represents an average household
in a household group. We omit household group subscripts in the exposition below to simply notation.
Representative households (for household groups)
are assumed to maximise welfare:
T

where E(y1 ) is the expected full income 10 in Ethiopian
Birr in period t. Subsistence leisure, Lemin, is valued
at the minimum wage rate, wy,, required for the work

level of leisure, to generate an income exactly equal
to the poverty line income:

discount rate.

relative risk aversion utility function; 8

where J.L is the partial relative risk aversion or the
absolute value of the elasticity of marginal utility of

where E(/1) is expected normalised full income in period t, 1/rlt the downside risk premium related to obtaining formal credit and o/21 the risk premium related

normalised by the poverty line full income (y 1), while
8 This type of utility function has been used by Binswanger
(1981) and others in empirical studies of risk preferences of farm
households. Its simple form makes it attractive also for modelling
purposes as risk aversion is captured by a single parameter.

and 1;1 is the poverty line income excluding the value

This formulation gives utility equal to zero if the
household has Y1 = 1, negative utility if Y1 is below the poverty line (Y1 < 1), and positive utility if
Y1 > 1. Population growth affects the time endowment and poverty line income causing both to grow
proportionally over time.
We are interested in the welfare changes of households over time. We define a Boserupian development path (Boserup, 1965) as a path where utility,
u1 , grows over time, and a Malthusian development
path (Malthus, 1798) as a path where utility declines
over time. 11 The requirement for a Boserupian development path is then that income grows faster than the
population, as Y1 is a measure of per capita income in
period t.
Risk premia are calibrated (Eqs. (A.8) and (A.9))
using a Taylor expansion and approximation over the
utility function (Sadoulet and de Janvry, 1995):

A.l. Market characteristics

Households may sell labour in some seasons
and buy labour in other seasons, however. The
households are assumed to be drudgery averse
(Chayanov, 1966; Nakajima, 1986). This implies
that the shadow wage rate is an increasing function
of the time worked and that there is a trade-off
between income and leisure. Indifference curves
between income and leisure will be upward sloping
and convex in labour and income space. Household
preferences for leisure in income-labour space are
formulated as a reservation wage curve that is convex and upward sloping and calibrated to fit the
observed seasonal labour supply/leisure demand
and wage rates in the area:

w; = fh + f]zDp + f33(Dp- f34) 2,
L*
Dp = ; ,

L; :'S Lp,

L; = LpF- LpH

The model incorporates the following market characteristics. We leave out the subscript for year to simplify notation.

• Credit market: Formal credit in kind (for fertiliser)
that is constrained from above (Eq. (A.lO)):
(A.lO)
This credit must be repaid after harvest. It may also
be possible to obtain informal credit within the village at a higher rate of interest (Eq. (All)):
(A.ll)
This credit must also be paid back within the same
year.
• Labour market: Households are assumed to have
constrained access to off-farm employment and the
wage rate in the labour market varies across seasons.
Households may also hire labour for work on the
farm. A price band is introduced such that the wage
rate for hiring labour, is about 10-20% higher than
the wage rate obtained while working off-farm. The
household shadow wage in season p,
should
fall between the buying wage and the selling wage
when households do not participate in the labour
market (Eq. (A.12)).

LpT = L;

(A.13)

where f3s are parameters, D P is the seasonal family labour divided by the household labour force
(W), L P is the maximum time which is available
for work, 12 Lpc is seasonal family labour in crop
production, L pL is seasonal family labour in livestock production, Lpo is seasonal off-farm family labour, L; is total seasonal family labour, LpF
is total seasonal on farm labour and LpH is hired
labour, LpT is the total seasonal time endowment,
and LpE is the seasonal leisure time. Labour for
conservation (building of new structures, maintenance of structures, and removal of old structures)
is included in Lpc· The religious holiday constraint
may be binding and limit labour supply in some periods of the year. The shadow wage is determined
by the intersection of the wage equation with the
labour constraint. We have not included a gender
division of labour in the model because of the difficulties it would involve. This may imply that labour
allocation is more efficient in the model than in
reality.
12 Maximum time available for farm work is determined by subtracting religious holidays from the total number of days in the
period. Work on the fatm is not permitted on religious holidays.

• Land market: There is an informal rental market for
land in the area. This market is interlinked with the
output market as the rent is paid in the form of a
share of the output (share tenancy). It is typically
households without oxen that are forced to rent out
part of their land and this land is rented in by households with two or more oxen. The share of the output
paid to the owner varies from 0.5 on the best land to
0.25 on poorer land. The scarcity of land in the area
in combination with the stickiness of the 'price' in
form of share of the output, cause demand (denoted
by superscript d) for land to exceed supply (Holden
and Shiferaw, 2000). Actual rented land cannot exceed the supply, however. A good reputation is important in order to be able to rent in land. For households renting land, denoted by superscript 2, we
get:
2d
Aos Aqr
> Y qr 1otq,

(A.l4)
where A~ 0 is a vector of operated land holding
(subscript o) by land type (subscript q), Aqw is a
vector of owned land (subscript w) by land quality class, A~r is rented land which is supply constrained given the shares of the output, C:tq, that
have to be paid to the owner. Typically, these shares
are equal to 0.5 for the best quality land, 0.33 on
medium quality land and 0.25 on poor quality land.
With these shares there 'Y is excess demand. is the
relative population weight for households renting
out versus households renting in land. For households renting out land, denoted by superscript 0, we
have:
A oqo

=

A-o

qw -

Aos 1 -

qr otq

(A.l5)

• Oxen rental market: Households that rent out land
do so because they lack oxen and are unable to borrow or rent in oxen to cultivate the land themselves.
Oxen owners are reluctant to rent out their oxen
due to moral hazard problems and the risk of their
oxen being mismanaged. Oxen may be borrowed
or rented, Oxrp• from relatives or close neighbours,
usually in exchange for labour (interlinked markets). Seasonal oxen working days, Ox 0 p, is therefore the sum of the working days by owned oxen

45

(Oxwp) and the amount of oxen days rented in or
out (Oxrp) during the period. Available oxen labour
days from own oxen is limited by the number of
religious holidays in the month.

WJoLiop = Oxrp :=:;: Oxrp,

(A.l6)

Oxwp:::;: Oxwp

The cost of keeping oxen relates to their purchasing
or breeding cost, fodder demand and the labour cost
of looking after them.
• Fodder market: Fodder is supplied by crop stover,
grass production on grazing and fallow land, and
purchased fodder. Households may decide to buy
or sell fodder depending on their farm size, land
allocation choices, the size of their livestock and
the price and availability of fodder. The supply of
fodder (Fo) in dry matter through own production
and purchase (Fod) is:
Fo = K8yicrAq Acr

+ KFod,

Fod:::;: Fo

(A.l7)

where 8yicrAq is a vector of stover or fodder yields
for different crops, including grass and fallow land,
for different land types, and K is a vector of dry
matter conversion factors.
• Seed market: It is assumed that markets for seed
function well but a price band is included making
the price of purchased seeds 5% higher than the
selling price. Households also have the option of
storing seeds from their own harvest for the next
season.
• Output markets: Output markets are assumed to
function well but a price band is included such that
the purchase price is assumed to be 5% higher than
the selling price.
A.2. Land degradation and conservation
The main forms of land degradation in the model
are soil erosion and nutrient depletion. Plot level soil
erosion per unit ofland (se Aq) is a function of soil type,
soil depth and slope (land type class, Aq), rainfall (1/Jr ),
crop choice (Cr), and use of conservation technology
(l/1):

(A.l8)

46

S. Holden, B. Shiferaw/Agricultural Economics 30 (2004) 31-49

Soil erosion rates were determined based on field experiments carried out by the SCRP in the study area. 13
Farmers may influence soil erosion rates through their
crop choice/land use or by building or removing conservation technologies on the different types of land.
The model implicitly evaluates the profitability of erosion control on the different types of land (soil type
depth and land slope). Soil erosion affects soil depth
(sd) through a transition equation:
(A.19)
where r is a conversion factor.
Nutrient depletion in the model focuses on nitrogen and phosphorous which are considered to be the
main nutrients limiting crop production in the area.
The balance or depletion per unit of land at the plot
level depends on the land/soil type, the stock of nutrients in the soil, crop choice, conservation technology use, yield, application of fertiliser and manure,
and the release of nutrients from the soil. Nutrients
are also lost through eroded soil and this soil is richer
in nutrients than the soil remaining behind. 14 Release
of nitrogen from the soil is assumed to depend on
the stock of nitrogen. 15 The change in N stock is
given by:
(A.20)
where N is nitrogen, ({! is the share of nitrogen mineralised in each period and 17 the nitrogen composition of the soil. The change in plant available N
13 It may be questioned whether the erosion experiments captured
the inflow of soils and not only the outflow, that is whether there
could be soil accumulation somewhere in the watershed. Definitely,
conservation structures captured much of the eroded soils and this
was likely to have a positive impact on crop yields. The topography
was such that it did not allow much soil accumulation in the
valley bottoms that could benefit crop production. The model is
calibrated based on erosion experiments, conservation technology
experiments and yield experiments on different soil types and
slope classes over several years. These experiments should also
capture much of the spatial movement of soils. We cannot claim
that these experiments provide unbiased estimates but it is the best
scientific information available. Spatial externality etTects may be
underestimated. They may, however, go in both directions (be
positive or negative) in terms of how they affect crop yields. They
may, e.g. contribute to gully formation and sediment accumulation
that negatively affect yields.
14 An enrichment factor of 2 is used for nitrogen.
15 We assume that I% of the nitrogen stock is released each year.

from period to period (¢) due to nutrient depletion is
computed as:
(A.21)
The reduction in plant available nitrogen is included
in the production function (Eq. (A.23)). The nutrients
in animal manure are released over 2 years with 60%
being released in the first year and the rest in the following year. The effects of nitrogen and rooting depth
depletion on yields are therefore included while the
effect of phosphorus depletion is not included. This is
because incorporation of this effect would require additional data on P-fixation, conversion of stabile P to
labile P and the total P stock in the soil.
Households may decide to conserve their land by
introducing conservation structures (graded soil/stone
bunds). Only labour is needed as an input for this,
100-120 working days/ha, depending on the slope of
the land. Maintenance of the structures requires an
additional 15-20 working days per year and hectare.
Shiferaw and Holden (1998) found, based on econometric analysis of plot level data collected in 1994,
that poor and land-scarce households were more
likely to dismantle conservation structures introduced
through food-for-work in the early 1980s. Therefore,
in our model households may also decide to remove
conservation structures and this is estimated to take
only 25% of the time required for construction. The
conservation structures may occupy some productive
land, therefore reducing the effective cropping area
and this may reduce initial crop yields. Two formulations of the model are used here, (a) where the
yield loss is negligible, and (b) where initial yields
are reduced by 5-10% depending on the slope of the
land. Building or removing conservation structures
may therefore affect long-term as well as short-term
yields. The long-term effect goes through the impact
on land degradation and the feedback through crop
yields.
A.3. Crop production
Yields of different crops are functions of soil type,
soil depth, slope, application of fertiliser and manure converted into nitrogen and phosphorus (P), and
conservation technology (IJI). The intercept of the
yield (yiint) function, suppressing the crop type and

year, is a function of soil type (Aq) and soil depth
(sd):
yiint

+ yi(Aq, sd)

(A.22)

The impact of soil depth on crop yield intercepts was
estimated econometrically using farm level experimental data from the study area and testing alternative
functional forms. 16 The final yields, including inputs,
were also estimated econometrically; 17

A.4. Livestock production
Cattle, sheep, goats, equines and chicken are the
common livestock types in the area. All these, except
equines, are included in the model. The productivity
of the livestock, birth rates, mortality, feed requirements, milk production, ploughing capacity, manure
production, culling rates, labour and other input costs
are included. For example, cattle are divided in male
and female calves, bulls, heifers, cows and oxen. The

(A.23)

where Np is fertiliser and manure nitrogen added, ¢ is
the change in available mineralised nitrogen, and Pp
is phosphorus added through fertilisers and manure.
Yields may be influenced by conservation technologies (IfF) as conservation structures take up some part
of the land, the structures may harbour pests, they may
reduce runoff and leaching and, of course, erosion.
The short-term effect on yields of the use of conservation technologies is therefore ambiguous but over time
yields under conservation should decline less rapidly
than without conservation.
Crop choice will depend on the profitability (prices
and yields), food, fodder, security, labour demand and
distribution, the suitability of the different types of
land, and access to inputs such as traction power,
fertiliser and property rights or rental arrangements
for land. The crops grown in the area include barley,
wheat, field pea, horse bean, lentils and linseed. Land
may also be planted with eucalyptus trees, grass or
left fallow. All the crops may be grown in the meher
season but only barley, field pea and lentils are grown
in the belg season.

model is calibrated to the average livestock holdings
for the different household groups, to the productivity
and lifetime of the local breeds of livestock. The number of animals in each category is therefore a continuous number, not an integer. This applies to rearing,
purchase, slaughter and sale of animals. Adult animals
kept in a specific period are computed as:

(A.24)

where LVP is animals kept in production, ~is culling
rate, m is mortality rate, LVB is animals bought, LVR
is young animals reared into adult animals, and LVS
is animals sold. Production of young animals is computed as:
b LVPft

= LVR 1 + LVRC 1 + LVRSr

(A.25)

where b is the birth rate, LVPf are female animals in
reproductive age, LVRC is young animals consumed,
and LVRS is young animals sold. These equations are
adjusted for different animal types depending on the
time spent different age classes and their reproduction
characteristics (determined from survey data and literature).
The decision to buy or sell animals depends on livestock productivity, mortality rates, buying and selling
prices, fodder availability, cash constraints, food requirements and preferences, and other costs and benefits related to keeping animals. In order to avoid complete disinvestment in the terminal year, the model is
constrained to such that not more than 20% of the
stock can be sold in the terminal year.
A.5. Crop-livestock interactions
Livestock provide traction power and manure for
crop production. A large share of the animal manure
from cattle is used for fuel, reducing the amount available for crop production. On the other hand, crop
residues are an important source of animal fodder.
Stover yields are modelled to be a function of crop
type and crop grain yields. Crop choice, crop management, e.g. use of fertiliser and animal manure,
and land degradation, therefore also indirectly affect
fodder yields. Total fodder production and purchased
feeds must satisfy the livestock dry matter feed requirements:

where W" is a vector of dry matter requirements for
different types of animals and LVP is a vector of animals kept of different types and age classes. Animal
manure available for crop production is calculated as:

(A.27)

where c is a vector of the farmyard manure production per animal by animal type which is utilised as
farmyard manure (excluding the part used for fuel).
The system of free grazing outside the cropping
season is not captured in the model. Likewise, the
prestige value of animals is not included. There may
therefore be more incentives to keep livestock than are
captured by the model.

where p~ and pi, are vectors of expected prices 18 for

of inputs in crop and livestock production, Qc and QL
are vectors of non-labour input quantities in crop and
livestock production, w po is a vector of seasonal wage
rates in off-farm employment, and OF is a vector of
seasonal participation in the labour market.
The cash constraint for farm input purchase is derived from the extended quadratic expenditure system.
The quadratic term was insignificant and was therefore omitted.

A.6. Household consumption

References
An extended quadratic expenditure system, including consumption of food grains, pulses, other consumption, and farm input expenditure, was estimated
based on consumption data from the 1994 household
survey. The quadratic expenditure system gave a better
fit than alternative expenditure systems (linear, log-lin,
lin-log). This system does not satisfy exact aggregation. Only the food grain and input expenditure equations were included in the model. The food consumption equations follow:
