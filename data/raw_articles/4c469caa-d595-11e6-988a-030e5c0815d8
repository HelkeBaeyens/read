Abstract
Pesticides are used as the primary method of pest control in Asian rice production. Conditions in China have led to demand for
high and increasing rice yields, resulting in intensive cultivation and adoption of fertilizer responsive varieties. The
consequence has been widespread pest infestations. Many studies have estimated pesticide productivity, but few have
estimated the productivity of alternative methods of pest control, namely host-plant resistance. None have estimated the
substitutability between these methods of pest-control. The productivity of pesticides and host-plant resistance, and the
substitutability between them is measured using two-stage Cobb-Douglas and translog production functions. Under intensive
rice production systems in eastern China, pesticide productivity is low compared to the productivity of host-plant resistance. In
fact, returns to pesticide use are negative at the margin. Host-plant resistance is an effective substitute for pesticides and
substantial reductions in pesticide use could be achieved, with no loss in rice production, through improvements in host-plant
resistance. These results suggest that pesticides are being overused in eastern China and host-plant resistance is being underutilized. Government policies to promote increased pesticides in rice might be ill advised given the low productivity and
negative returns, particularly in light of well known negative externalities associated with pesticide use. © 1998 Elsevier

1. Introduction
Farmers around the world are engaged in a constant
battle, the battle against crop destroying pests. Pests
can cause crop damage and diminish farmers' welfare.
Fortunately, producers can mitigate the impacts of
crop pests, and do so most commonly by applying
chemical pesticides. Reliance on pesticides as the

primary or sole means of pest control, however,
may not be the most profitable or sustainable strategy,
and may have a number of harmful side effects. In the
battle against pests, pesticides are a double-edged
sword.
Since the mid-1970s, researchers have described
unintended consequences from pesticide use in agriculture, particularly in developing countries, and several economic studies have questioned whether
current patterns of pesticide use are economically
and socially efficient. Policy makers in many countries
have begun to regulate pesticide use, and have taken

interest in alternative methods for controlling agricultural pests. One method of non-chemical pest control
in field crops is the development and dissemination of
varieties with host-plant resistance. A resistant crop
variety suffers smaller yield losses than non-resistant
varieties when subjected to pest infestation. Hostplant resistance may also substitute for and/or complement chemical pesticides in reducing pest losses
and increasing crop yields.
The role of host-plant resistance as a pest control
alternative raises several important concerns about
commonly observed farming practices. For
example, if currently available vanetles are
already resistant to damaging pests, why do farmers
continue to use heavy doses of pesticides? In the
presence of host-plant resistance, do pesticide-based
reductions in pest damage justify the cost of the
pesticide? Agronomic evidence suggests that in some
cases they do not; common rates of pesticide usage
may be inefficient in the presence of host-plant resistance (Buntin et al., 1992; Robinson et al., 1978;
Teetes, 1994).
While studies of pesticide productivity are relatively common, few researchers have assessed the
production impacts of host-plant resistance and almost
none have explored the interactions between pesticides and host-plant resistance. The goal of this
paper is to ·analyze the shortcomings of China's pesticide-intense insect and disease control strategies by
examining the relative productivity of pesticides and
host-plant resistance, and the interactions between
them. To meet this goal, the paper first describes
the pest management strategies used by China's farmers and the incentives for input intensive rice production that lead to high pesticide use. The paper then
examines the effectiveness of pest control strategies
on rice production in eastern China, strategies based
on high levels of insecticide and fungicide use as well
as adoption of varieties which contain insect and
disease resistance. Finally, the paper discusses the
possible reasons why farmers apply high rates of
pesticides and do not effectively utilize host-plant
resistance, and the policy implications of such behavior.
To narrow the scope of the work, the paper
addresses pest management practices in two provinces
of eastern China, Zhejiang and Jiangsu. In order to
collect the data necessary to carefully analyze pest

control productivity, the authors studied the production and management behavior of farmers in China's
most important cropping sector during more than a
year of field work, collecting a unique set of production, varietal, and pest infestation data at the township
level.

2. Intensification of agriculture and infestation of
pests in eastern China
Fertile soil and abundant water resources make
China's greater Yangtse River Delta region one of
the world's most productive rice growing regions.
With low per-capita land availability (Table 1), farmers in the region have traditionally generated some of
Asia's highest rice yields through intensive application of labor (Table 1). As the region's population
growth has increased pressure on land, pressure has
also risen to increase rice yields to address national
concerns of rice self-sufficiency. Farmers are required
to sell a substantial amount of rice production to state
procurement agencies (Table 1). Although yield
increases are a priority for government leaders,
increasing off-farm labor opportunities have diminished labor availability and placed the burden for
high yields on intensifying the use of purchased
inputs (Table 1). These conditions have induced
China's agricultural research system to generate,
and pushed local leaders and farmers to adopt, modern
agricultural technology, including pesticides (Lin,
1992; Huang and Rozelle, 1996). For example, farmers in both Zhejiang and Jiangsu increased their use of
chemical fertilizers at about 5% per year (Widawsky,
1996) while increasing their adoption of high-yielding, input-intensive hybrid rice varieties.
2.1. Rising levels of pest infestations
Although pest infestations have always been a
feature of China's rice production, they became a
chronic problem with the adoption of fertilizer responsive varieties, a fallout from the technological revolution that began in the 1960s and has continued since
then (Chengxiang, 1988). Averaging over the four
major rice insect pests, the sample areas in Jiangsu
and Zhejiang experienced outbreaks approximately
1.5 times in 1985 and nearly two times in 1991

Note: The study sites include eight townships in each of the eight counties across two provinces in eastern China (Zhejiang and Jiangsu) for a
total of 64 townships. Data were collected for 8 years from 1984-1991. The number of pesticide applications per year is an index of the
number of times the entire sown area of a township was treated. The total area treated during each application is systematically recorded, and
divided by sown area to create the index. Although some pesticides treat bacterial diseases, for ease of labelling, all disease control chemicals
are here called fungicides.
Source: Authors' survey.

(Fig. 1, panel A) 1• Although disease generally
affected rice fields somewhat less, each plot experienced an outbreak about one time per season (Panel
B). If farmers had not responded with pest control
treatments, meaning pesticide applications in the
study area, local agricultural officials estimate that

from 15% to 35% of the total crop would have been
lost during the entire 8 year study period (Fig. 1, Panel
C, light bars). After responding with pesticides, the
actual losses fell (dark bars), but farmers still lost from
3% to 13%.

2.2. Pesticide use
1Percent

infested area is calculated by adding total infestation for
all pests and dividing by sown area. When percent sown area is
more than 100%, it indicates that on average more than one pest
had infested the rice fields. Infestation figures, as well as potential
and actual loss figures, are estimated by technicians (sometimes
more than one) who are stationed in every township in the study
area and also required to estimate crop losses from pests on an
outbreak by outbreak basis. They report the level of loss they
believed an untreated infestation would have caused in the absence
of pesticide applications, as well as the actual loss incurred by
farmers.

With the threat of crop losses from pests rising
during the 1960s and 1970s, government officials
assumed responsibility for pest control primarily by
increasing the availability of chemical pesticides. By
the 1980s, land-poor farmers in eastern China were
applying pesticides regularly and at high levels
(Table 1). The frequency of pesticide applications
on rice in most of the counties studied, is among

the highest in rice producing Asia, comparable to that
of Japan (Edwards, 1986). Among the survey locations in eastern China, five of the eight counties had
average rates of insecticide use nearly twice that of
lowland irrigated rice systems in the Philippines,
where serious health and environmental effects
have been linked to pesticide use (Rola and Pingali,
1993).

2.3. Drawbacks of intensive pesticide use
With high rates of pesticide use and the negative
externalities associated with such levels, there is a
concern about whether pesticide use has reached
levels at which direct marginal contributions are
minor, or perhaps even negative. Insecticide sprays
early in a rice cropping season have been shown to

D. Widawsky et al.!Agricultural Economics 19 (1998) 203-217

decimate populations of natural predators and induce
infestations of damaging pests such as brown
planthopper (Kenmore, 1980; Heinrichs and Mochida,
1984; Schoenly et al., 1996). The phenomenon of a
'pesticide spiral' may occur when heavy pesticide use
in rice results in pest populations that are pesticide
resistant (Chelliah and Heinrichs, 1980). Increasing
pest resistance to pesticides creates a situation in
which higher levels of pesticide are needed to achieve
the same level of pest control (Litsinger, 1989). In
China, field and laboratory studies have shown that
increasing resistance in pest populations to high rates
of pesticide use has decreased the effectiveness of
pesticides (Chu et al., 1987; Su et al., 1991).

2.4. Host-plant resistance in China
While breeding efforts to incorporate host-plant
resistance in rice had started elsewhere, by the late
1970s a number of Chinese rice breeders were devel-

207

oping pest resistant rice varieties. In some areas the
presence of resistance was mandated for seed certification. However, given the emphasis in agricultural
planning to development and expansion of farm chemicals, host-plant resistance was assigned a secondary
role, and adoption of varieties with host-plant resistance was rarely accompanied by decreases in pesticide use.
Despite this secondary status, local officials
extended and farmers in eastern China adopted a wide
array of rice varieties with host-plant resistance to
insects and diseases during the period of the survey.
On an average, most townships had between three and
nine pest resistant varieties planted by farmers
(Widawsky, 1996). Even with these resistant varieties,
producers in the study area continued to use pesticides
at rates high enough that they may have contributed to
a deterioration of the resistance originally embodied in
the newly released varieties. A substantial proportion
of sown varieties grown during the 1984-1991 study

For varieties that were grown over an entire period (e.g. 1984-1988) in a township, these figures reflect the% of incidences when host-plant
resistance for a variety was lower at the end of the period than at the beginning. For example, 29% of varieties grown over the entire period
1984-1991 had declining resistance to neck blast.
b For the above incidences, when varieties had declining resistance over a period, these figures represent the proportion of deterioration that
occurred based on the 5-point resistance scale. For example, among the 29% of varieties grown over the period 1984-1991 that had declining
neck blast resistance, the average rate of resistance deterioration was 35%.
c For all varieties grown over an entire period, these figures represent the average rate of resistance deterioration. This includes varieties both
with and without declining resistance. For example, among all varieties grown over the period 1984-1991, the average rate of deterioration in
neck blast was 11%.

period, experienced deteriorating host-plant resistance
(Table 2)? Among varieties with deteriorating hostplant resistance, the magnitude of resistance decline is
substantial, averaging 25%-35% decline for all pests
(Table 2). The average decline in resistance among all
varieties, both those with and without deteriorating
host-plant resistance, is still considerable and raises
concerns about China's ability to maintain current
levels of host-plant resistance in its rice cultivars
(Table 2).
While host-plant resistance should aid in the struggle to maintain high yields by minimizing pest
damage, the process of breeding for insect and disease
resistance may be associated with lower yield potentials. A yield/resistance tradeoff may arise because
host-plant resistance is commonly strongest in landraces or other cultivars with lower maximum-attainable yields (Khush, 1987), and their incorporation into
modem rice cultivars adds genetic material from land
races that may reduce yields. Back-crossing using
high-yielding varieties can minimize this trade-off,
but agricultural officials in eastern China indicated
this had not always been completely successful.

3. Modelling pest control in China
The discussion above raises several important questions about the effectiveness of pest control practices
in China. Does applying pesticides in rice justify their
use at current rates, especially in the presence of
improved varieties with host-plant resistance? Is
host-plant resistance a productive input in rice production? Can host-plant resistance effectively substitute for pesticides as a form of pest control?
Answering these questions requires measuring the
productivity of both pesticides and host-plant resis2 A metric of pest resistance for rice varieties grown in eastern
China is based on internationally recognized methods of assessing
pest resistance in rice (International Rice Research Institute, 1979).
Varieties that show some level of resistance are assigned a
standardized resistance index based on their susceptibility (or lack
of it). In the study area in eastern China, the resistance scale ranged
from 0 to 5 and was based on criteria in government published
handbooks. Resistance data were collected from seed company and
plant protection departments at each location for varieties grown in
that location, and the status of resistant varieties was tracked over
time for each of six major pests.

tance, as well as measuring the tradeoff between the
two. This section outlines the empirical framework for
analyzing pest control in China, describes the data,
and presents results from the analysis.
Modelling pest control presents a challenge for
several reasons. To estimate their productivity, measures of both chemical pesticides and host-plant resistance need to be included in the analysis. To our
knowledge, no previous study has tried to treat
host-plant resistance as a directly measured input.
There are complex interactions between pest infestations and crop yields, and model specification must be
sufficiently flexible to include parameters for interactions and substitutability. The use of pesticides by
farmers and their effectiveness may also depend on the
level of pest infestation. For unbiased and efficient
estimates of the impact of pesticide inputs on yields,
the frequency and severity of pest outbreaks need to be
taken into consideration.

3.1. Functional forms and empirical specifications
The Cobb-Douglas production function has often
been used to estimate pesticide productivity, but has
two shortcomings. The elasticity of substitution
between host-plant resistance and pesticide (and
among all other inputs) is constrained to be identically
equal to one, and a standard Cobb-Douglas model
does not account for the potential endogeneity of
pesticides. If pesticides are applied in response to pest
pressure, and high levels of infestations are correlated
to lower yields, then a relationship between pesticides
and negative residuals in a production function might
bias productivity estimates for pesticide and host-plant
resistance.
To empirically account for these factors, the initial
modelling approach used in this analysis can be
specified as a two-stage Cobb-Douglas models with
interaction terms. The first stage to be estimated is a
log-linearized exponential function for pesticide
use:

where Zp is the logarithm of insecticides and
fungicides, and is modelled as a function of scope
(A;) and severity (Dj) of pest infestations and shifter
variables (Ln and Sg). The coefficients to be estimated
are ao, a;, di, bh, and cg. Pesticides appear as an
exponential function since pesticides are applied in
eastern China according to certain conditions (e.g.
pest infestations), but pesticide use levels off rather
quickly. 3
Using predicted values of Zp from Eq. (1) and
allowing for interactions between chemical pesticides
and host-plant resistance by including the terms z1z3 ,
and ZzZ4, pest control productivity can be estimated
from the log-linear production function in the second

Alternatively, a two-stage translog specification

"fk> and 8h. The vector of 'normal' inputs, x, includes
factors such as fertilizer and labor, S accounts for
yield differences due to cropping patterns and
major weather events. Locational shifters, L, account
for fixed differences in regional elements such as
water control, soil, and land fertility. Including
pest control interaction terms in the production
function relaxes the constraint on fixed substitutability between pesticides and host-plant resistance
that is typical of the Cobb-Douglas function,
but retains the parsimony of the form. If yields
and inputs are scaled by their geometric means, then
the elasticity of substitution can be expressed from
the estimated coefficients of Eq. (2) as (Boisvert,
1982):

3 The pesticide equations were also estimated as simple linear
functions and there was very little difference in coefficient
estimates or regression coefficients. The exponential form was
therefore employed because it facilitates testing of pesticide
endogeneity in a Cobb-Douglas production function using
Hausman's (1978) method.

Using data scaled by their geometric means in the
translog production function, the elasticity of substitution of host-plant resistance for insecticides is given

3.2. Data

The data come from a variety of sources in rural
China, and were collected by the authors during nearly
one year of fieldwork in 1993. Township-level data
come from eight randomly selected townships in
each of the eight counties (for a total of 64 townships)
in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces and were available
for eight years, 1984-1991. While most information
came from standard data reporting and statistical
collection sources, the written records of pest control
technicians from the 64 townships provided information for unique measures of pesticide inputs, pest
infestations, pest damage, and the level of pest-resistance for each variety. Rice yield was measured in
kg ha - 1 and explanatory variables were specified as
follows.
Pesticides: This study uses three common techniques for measuring pesticide use: real monetary value
(yuanlha), pure active ingredient (kg a.i./ha), and

210

D. Widawsky et at./Agricultural Economics 19 (1998) 203-217

potency-adjusted or 'effective' amounts where active
ingredient was standardized by a recommended dose
for each pesticide. Measures of all the three are
utilized for both insecticides and disease-control
pesticides using detailed pesticide data collected in
each township;
Host-plant resistance: Each variety grown in each
location is assigned resistance scores (for 3 year
intervals) to each of the four insects and two diseases
using a five-point scale (with higher scores being
associated with higher resistance). Variety-specific
resistance data are weighted in two ways. First, since
high resistance to a certain insect does not insure
resistance to all insects, pest-specific resistance
is weighted by the incidence of that pest in the
township, giving more weight to resistance against
the most chronic pests. Second, since widely sown
varieties exert greater influence on township-level
yield than sparsely sown varieties, proportion of
sown area in each variety is used to weigh varietyspecific insect and disease resistance, giving more
weight to cultivars that dominate a township's varietal
mix.
Pest pressure: The proportion of total sown area
infested by a given insect or disease is an indicator of
the extent of pest pressure. Incidence of multiple
pesticide treatments is included as a measure of the
severity of a pest infestation.
Other factors: Chemical fertilizer is included
as a pure nutrient amount of both nitrogen and
phosphorous (i.e. kg pure N/ha). Labor is measured
as the ratio of available laborers to total cultivated
area (and exhibited strong positive correlation with
provincial estimates of per hectare labor use, as
enumerated in the state price bureau's cost of
production data). Machinery input is the proportion
of cultivated area plowed by mechanical tractor.
Time is a proxy for technical change. The proportion
of double-cropping represents the influence of a
shorter growing season compared to single-season
rice production. A dummy variable for climatic
disasters (e.g. a major flood in Gaoyou in 1991)
accounts for major production shocks. Procurement obligations quotas (in kg ha- 1) in pesticide
prediction equations measure policy pressure to generate high yields through the use of pesticides. Fixedeffects, or county-specific dummy variables, account
for spatial differences. The data are summarized by

their mean and standard deviation in Widawsky
(1996).

4. Results
Eqs. (1) and (2) were estimated as specified.
The two-stage translog model (Eqs. (1) and (4))
produced alternative estimates, where some interaction terms were restricted to reduce multicolinearity.4 For each model, three estimates are obtained
corresponding to the different methods for measuring
pesticides. 5
The general performance of the yield function
estimates is fairly robust with regard to pesticide
specification and yield function (Table 3). The
R2 -values of the estimated yield functions vary
from 0.53 to 0.59. Because conditions in eastern
China emphasize high yields and input use, one
might expect that the high rate at which the traditional inputs are used leads to low marginal productivities. The productivity of fertilizer, labor, and
machinery are generally quite low, but are similar
to those found in other studies of intensive rice
cultivation in Asia, in general (Pingali et al.,
1995b), and China in particular (Putterman and
Chiacu, 1994).6
Parameter estimates from the pesticide prediction
equations demonstrate that pesticide use is correlated
to rate of infestation of both insects and diseases
(Table 4). Regression coefficients ranged from 0.42
to 0.57 for the insecticide equations and from 0.30 to
0.35 for the fungicide equations. Tests of endogeneity
4 Since there are four pest control inputs and four normal inputs,
there are potentially 36 interaction terms alone which makes
estimation unfeasible. Therefore, the interaction which were not
restricted to be equal to zero were: squared pest control terms,
squared normal-input terms, insecticide* (insect resistance),
fungicide* (disease resistance), and all nitrogen* (pest control
input) interactions.
5 Full regression summaries are given in Widawsky, 1996.
6 The other explanatory variables in the yield equations all had
expected impacts on yield. The positive coefficient on the time
variable supports the notion that technological progress took place
during the survey period, and is consistent with other studies of rice
yields in China (Huang and Rozelle, 1996). Double-cropping is
associated with lower yields, the result of shorter growing seasons.
The coefficient on the variables representing inclement weather
years is predictably negative in all cases.

reject the simple Cobb-Douglas model in which
pesticides are assumed to be exogenous? Models of
rice yield that do not account for the relationship
between pesticides, pest infestations, and rice yields
may generate biased estimates of pest control productivity. Therefore, while some coefficient estimates
from the simple Cobb-Douglas functions are similar
to those of the other yield functions, we will concentrate the rest of our attention on estimates derived from
the models where pesticides are endogenous.

4.1. Estimates of pesticide productivity
Productivity of pesticides as measured by elasticity
of production, and allocative efficiency as measured
by the ratio of value marginal product of pesticide to
the price of pesticides suggest that farmers in China
are overusing chemical pest control methods

7 Endogeneity of pesticides was tested using Hausman (1978)
method. The test is run by estimating the two-stage Cobb-Douglas
yield function with both predicted and actual pesticide levels and
testing whether the coefficients on both predicted insecticide and
fungicide are jointly zero (an F-test). For value-based measures of
pesticides the F-value was 4.18, for active ingredient based
measures it was 6.02, and for effective or potency-based measures
the F-value was 1.91. The first two tests comfortably reject the null
hypothesis that pesticides are exogenous, and the last test is
somewhat less convincing. Exogeneity of instruments was tested
with Hausman (1983) method which simplifies to regressing the
residuals from Eq. (2) on the instruments. A low R2 -value implies
that the error is not correlated to the explanatory instruments. A
high R2 -value rejects the null hypothesis of no correlation (e.g.
exogeneity). The test statistic is IVR2 , where N is the number of
observations. The test-statistic is distributedchi as (chi-squared
with 2 degrees of freedom, and had values of 11.46, 11.41, and
18.13 for the value-based, pure, and effective specifications of
pesticide, respectively. The second nested (null) hypothesis is that
there is no difference between the two-stage Cobb-Douglas and
translog models. Testing the null hypothesis that there is no
difference between the models is carried out by jointly testing
whether all the interaction terms are equal to zero, a standard Ftest. In the estimates using value-based and active-ingredient based
pesticides, the test statistics reject, with 99% confidence, the
hypothesis that the two-stage Cobb-Douglas and translog specifications are the same (F=2.102 and 2.2716, respectively). For the
model using potency-adjusted active ingredient, the test-statistic is
F= 1.354 and rejects the null hypothesis less convincingly at 83%
confidence. In spite of this, there is not too much difference
between the two specifications in estimates of pesticide productivity, host-plant resistance productivity, or elasticities of substitution,
as the next section shows.

211

(Table 5). 8 Small and significant production elasticity
for insecticide (and even negative in the case of
fungicides) indicate that producers receive low returns
at the margin. Pesticide use is allocatively inefficient
in so far as additional pesticide use generates costs
greater than the returns from higher yields. If pesticides have negative net returns in production, and the
externalities of pesticide use (which are not included)
have been shown to increase costs even further (as
shown in Rola and Pingali, 1993), then these results
may aid in formulating future policies that reduce the
use of chemical pesticides.

4.2. Estimates of host-plant resistance productivity
Productivity of host-plant resistance to insects, as
measured by its production elasticity, is positive for all
specifications of the production models (Table 5).
These results show that host-plant resistance is effective at the margin in controlling insects. Moreover,
economic returns to improving host-plant resistance
may be substantial. One rough way to calculate the
value of host-plant resistance to insects in the two
study provinces is to suppose a modest 1% increase in
host-plant resistance and use production elasticities to
calculate the value of the increase in rice production
that would result. The value of the increase in Zhejiang
and Jiangsu would range from$ 281 000 to$ 1.49 million. 9 These calculations do not take into account
supply responses and price effects from increased
production. Rather, they are a heuristic device to
broadly define the magnitudes of direct benefits from
small improvements in host-plant resistance. In fact,
these benefits are substantial when compared to the
approximately $ 1.5 million per year that is spent on
all rice research in four provinces in eastern China,
including Zhejiang and Jiangsu (Rozelle et al., 1996).
Resistance to diseases had negative estimated impacts
(a somewhat counter-intuitive result that may be
related to both the rapid deterioration of the effective-

8These measures were calculated from estimated pest control
coefficients in yield equations (see Appendix A).
9 These figures are based on province-wide rice production in
1993 of 17.13 million tin Jiangsu and 12.99 million tin Zhejiang
(ZGNYNJ, 1995), a rice price of 417 yuanlt, and an exchange rate
of Y 8.3/$. All prices in the analysis are deflated using the rural
price index.

4.3. Elasticity of substitution of host-plant resistance
for pesticides

Another striking result of the model estimates is
that in all cases, there is substantial potential for

substituting host-plant resistance for insecticides.
Based on the elasticities of substitution, improvements
in host-plant resistance can be accompanied by
decreases in insecticides, with no loss in production
(Table 5). Approximate estimates of the value of
pesticide savings from a 10% increase in the index
of host-plant resistance show that the savings from

substituting host-plant resistance for insecticides
could be substantial. 10

10Calculations can be made similar to the ones for approximating
the productivity gain from improvements in host-plant resistance.
They show that the savings in insecticide ranges from US$ 305 000
per year to US$ 7.55 million per year. Once again, these results are
based on current prices that do not take into account price changes
from a shrinking insecticide market. However, as before, the
example shows that in just the two study provinces, the benefits
from an improvement in host-plant resistance may well outweigh
the costs, and at the same time substantially reduce negative
externalities from pesticide use.

5. Discussion and conclusions
Pesticide use is high in eastern China, a consequence of economic and policy pressures to raise
yields by intensifying input use. The difference
between potential and actual crop loss might lead
one to conclude that China's pesticide-first policy
has been successful, a statistic often cited by government leaders as the basis for continuing pro-pesticide
policies. This paper has shown, however, that although
pesticides may reduce crop losses on average, they are
probably being overused in Chinese rice production
while host-plant resistance is being under-utilized. All

• Elasticity of production is evaluated at the geometric mean.
b Allocative efficiency is the ratio of value marginal product of pesticide to pesticide price. Value marginal product is evaluated at the
geometric mean.

estimates show that current rates of pesticide use are
allocatively inefficient at the margin, connoting inefficiency even in the absence of other issues such as
negative externalities.
Why are farmers overusing pesticides? One reason
may be that farmers lack good information about the
productivity of pesticides. Studies in the Philippines
(Pingali et al., 1995a), Vietnam (Heong et al., 1994),
and elsewhere in Asia have shown that after farmers
received information about the true productivity of
pesticides in rice production, they decreased their use
of pesticide, often dramatically so. Another argument
raised in trying to reconcile negative returns to producers is that since farmers may be risk averse, and

pesticides may help reduce the risk of catastrophic
pest loss, the apparent economic inefficiency is, in
fact, merely a rational risk premium and not economic
inefficiency at all. Some of the studies cited above,
however, have shown that curtailment of pesticide use
has occurred with no precipitous increase in yield
variability. Even if farmers are risk averse, reducing
pesticide use may not increase uncertainty.
The results also show that host-plant resistance,
especially insect resistance, is a productive, underutilized input. Benefits from improvements in hostplant resistance may be quite large. As a substitute for
pesticides, improvements in host-plant resistance
could lead to substantial savings in pesticides without

reducing rice yields. Part of the under-utilization of
host-plant resistance may be grounded in a lack of
information. In spite of the fact that varieties with
host-plant resistance are widely available, there is
scant evidence that producers take into account available host-plant resistance in choosing how much
pesticide to use.
All these results strongly suggest that China might
do well to reconsider its commitment to increasing
pesticide use in rice and consider increasing investments in improving host-plant resistance. More importantly, it is critical to appreciate that the relationship
between the two is complex, and additional detailed
research on the dynamic nature of pest control, infestation, and productivity is needed.
