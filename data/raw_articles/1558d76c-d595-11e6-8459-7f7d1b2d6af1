Abstract

Growth in agriculture depends on many things but one of the most important is investment in agricultural
research. Decision making in the agricultural research policy area can only be aided by access to better information.
This article overviews a recent endeavor to move policy dialogue beyond merely qualitative impressions towards a
process that is underpinned with new and cogent data. The data used have been assembled at ISNAR in a manner
designed to make comparisons both over time and between countries more valid than has been the case in the past.
The comparisons thus possible reveal considerable diversity both between countries and between broad regional
aggregations. Also illuminated here are issues related to the commodity orientation, capital and labor intensity, and
size and scope of particular national programs.

The research data reported here are largely from a study
undertaken by ISNAR with assistance from the then Agnculture and Rural Development Department of the World Bank
(Pardey, Roseboom and Anderson, 1991). The monetary values throughout this paper have been expressed in constant
1980 PPP dollars. PPP stands for purchasing power parity and
represents a synthetic exchange rate that attempts to reflect
the purchasmg power of a currency. Monetary values m
current local currency were first deflated to base-year 1980
with a local (GoP) deflator and then converted into constant
1980 dollars using 1980 PPP exchange rates taken from Summers and Heston (1988) and, for China, Summers and Heston
(1991). The authors thank Hugh Quigley for hts assistance in
preparing this paper.

Policy-makers are having to contend with unprecedently rapid changes in the market for agricultural science and technology services. In the
less-developed countries, the rapid expansion of
agricultural research capacity experienced during
the 1960s and 1970s slowed considerably in the
1980s. Particularly in debt-ridden regions, such as
sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America and
Caribbean, investment in agricultural research
stagnated or even declined. In addition, the level
of development aid to less-developed countries
stalled during the 1980s (OECD, 1989) while the
small but significant share that was channeled to
agricultural research is threatened by other demands. A reversal of these trends seems unlikely

upon to broaden their research agendas and to
give greater attention to concerns of environmental degradation and resource management. The
international system is also restructuring its research portfolio with regard to forestry, fisheries
and vegetable research in addition to its traditional emphasis on basic food crops and livestock.
These changes raise major policy issues about the
appropriate division of labor and problem focus
between the national, regional and international
centers that are yet to be resolved.
There are large variations across countries and
over time in the level of investment in agricultural research. As a country's per-capita income
grows, its support for agricultural research - as
indexed by an agricultural research intensity
(ARI) ratio that expresses research expenditures
relative to agricultural output - tends also to
grow. But there are offsetting tendencies, includ-

in the near future and therefore resources for
public agricultural research in less-developed
countries could well tighten even further in the
coming years. In the more-developed countries,
public support for agricultural research is under
close review and there is a strong tendency to
have those who most directly benefit from research pick up at least part of the bill. Moreover,
agricultural surpluses, declining agricultural
prices, and a continuing decline in farm numbers
in many of the more-developed countries have
led to populist calls for a moratorium on further
public investment in agricultural research.
Against this backdrop of fiscal stringencies,
the demands being placed on national, and indeed international, research systems are intensifying. In addition to the traditional emphasis on
stimulating productivity growth within agriculture, many of these systems are also being called

ing one whereby agricultural research expenditures rise less than proportionately with agricultural output, due possibly to economies of size or
economies of scope in research. In this paper we
present a quantitative review of the global pattern of investment in agricultural research using a
new compilation of data that serves to completely
revise and update the data series reported by
Evenson and Kislev (1975), Oram and Bindlish
(1981) and Judd, Boyce and Evenson (1986). Our
intention is to illustrate what is actually happening in the world of agricultural research and to
help move the policy dialogue beyond merely
qualitative impressions toward a process that is
underpinned with a set of basic data and quantitative indicators.

1. Public investments in national agricultural
research

1.1. Investment trends

Differences in patterns of agricultural growth
are in large part the result of national differences
in factor and environmental endowments and in
the policies adopted towards agriculture and,
more specifically, agricultural research. For two
decades, up to the mid-1980s, global investment
in public agricultural research increased substantially. 1 Between 1961-65 and 1981-85, the total
number of public-sector agricultural researchers
grew at an average annual rate of 4.2%. The
number of researchers in less-developed countries increased by 7.2% a year, just over four
times the annual rate in more-developed countries (Table 1).
In the period 1981-85, the less-developed
countries employed 59% of the world's agricultural researchers, compared with 33% in 1961-65.
Annual growth rates in research investment in
less-developed countries have slowed during the

very small countries for which no data were available.

1980s, most noticeably in sub-Saharan Africa, and
Latin America and Caribbean, both of which
have been struggling to contain soaring international debts. In fact, the 1976-80 to 1981-85
annual rate of growth in real research expenditures was only 0. 7% for sub-Saharan Africa and
0.9% for Latin America and Caribbean compared
with a more-and less-developed country average
of 2.9% and 4.3%, respectively. Although spending on agricultural research increased faster in
less-developed than in more-developed countries
during the past two decades, the less-developed
countries' share of total expenditure on research
rose only to 48% from its 37% in 1961-65.
Of the less-developed regions, only in Asia and
Pacific did annual growth in research expenditures exceed the annual increase in researchers.
In more-developed countries, on the other hand,
spending on research increased twice as fast as
the number of researchers.
1.2. Expenditures per researcher

Average spending per researcher in less-developed countries has been falling since the early
1970s. In 1981-85, it was actually lower in real
terms than in 1961-65. In more-developed countries meanwhile, spending per researcher has been
rising steadily and the emphasis has consistently
been towards greater investment in human capital within the NARSs.
One reason for the relatively lower spending
per researcher in less-developed countries is that,
of late, the rapidly expanded university systems in
these countries have produced many more graduates than previously. Many governments in lessdeveloped countries insist that public bodies, including research systems, employ graduates, but
then fail to provide adequate matching funds.
In the Asia and Pacific region, expenditure per
researcher has always been lower than in other
less-developed regions. This is partly because relative prices for labor are lower, which induces a
substitution of labor for other inputs in the system. But it is also because they are dominated by
larger research systems that may well be able to
realize economies of scale and scope.

110

J.R. Anderson eta/. I Agricultural Economics 10 (1994) 107-123

In sub-Saharan Africa, expenditure per researcher has for a long time been higher than in
other regions. During the 1960s, the NARSs in
this region continued to be heavily staffed by
relatively expensive expatriates from the former
colonial powers. The poor quality of Africa's infrastructure and the need to import nearly all
equipment also drive up the research costs in this
region. Although still higher than in most other
less-developed regions, spending per researcher
in sub-Saharan Africa is falling, in part a reflection of the fact that expatriate researchers are
increasingly being replaced by less expensive national research staff, and in part because of the
above-mentioned budgetary crises.

1.3. Human capital
One of the fundamental strengths (or, too often, weaknesses) of NARSs, and a major factor in
determining the success of agricultural research,
lies in the quality, composition and deployment
of their research staff.
Developing meaningful measures of this human capital component is challenging both conceptually and practically. Indicators such as university qualifications and years of research experience may explain much of the difference in
quality between research systems, but they are
not the only factors. The composition of the
research staff will depend, among other things,
on the NARS's size and the type of research it is
conducting. These influences vary greatly between regions and will change within a system
over time. For instance, a smaller NARS whose
activities are focused more on capturing research
spillovers and adapting them to local circumstances is unlikely to need a cadre of researchers
similar to that required by a large NARS that is
likely to confront an altogether different scale
and set of research problems. Similarly, while a
system dominated by researchers holding PhDs
and 20 years of experience may be considered
highly qualified, it is not necessarily the most
appropriate labor force to confront the applied
and site-specific problems that face many national research systems today.
Data for the period 1981-85 indicate that

a

roughly one-half of agricultural researchers, including expatriates, in less-developed countries
held a postgraduate research degree (Table 2). If
expatriate researchers are excluded from the calculation, no less-developed region has a share of
researchers with a postgraduate qualification
greater than 60%. For a significant number of
countries it is even lower than 40%. Somewhat
surprisingly, poorer less-developed regions have a
relatively high proportion of qualified staff, although that is much lower if expatriate researchers are excluded from the calculation.
In many less-developed countries, the early
agricultural research institutes were established
by European colonial powers and, during the first
half of this century, these institutes were staffed
with expatriate researchers. On independence,
most former colonies moved to replace expatriates with national researchers. In some countries,
this change took place gradually but in others it
was a more abrupt process and caused major
disruptions in agricultural research programs. At
present, only the smaller countries of sub-Saharan
Africa, the Caribbean, the Pacific and the oil-rich
countries of West Asia have relatively large proportions of expatriates on their research staffs.
The share of expatriates is declining rapidly, however. In sub-Saharan Africa, for example, the
share of expatriates in NARSs was about 90% in

J.R. Anderson eta!. j Agricultural Economics 10 (1994) 107-123

1960 but had declined to some 30% in the early
1980s. Making the plausible assumption that the
numbers of expatriate researchers working within
the Chinese and Indian systems are negligible,
the percentage of expatriate researchers working
throughout the less-developed world in 1981-85
is estimated to be around 3%.
Although economic development can be expected to increase the supply of university graduates, research systems in some of the wealthier
less-developed countries appear to have difficulty
recruiting or retaining qualified staff. In part, this
is because salaries and conditions in public agricultural research institutes are not competitive
with other employment opportunities. In a number of countries, for example, universities employ
large numbers of PhDs in the agricultural sciences, while the national public agricultural research institutes employ few or none.
On the other hand, as argued earlier, a large
proportion of PhDs on the research staff does not
necessarily indicate a successful or a mature research program. The contemporary systems of
Australia and New Zealand, for instance, have
apparently achieved significant successes with a
high proportion of staff trained only to the BSc or
MSc level, as did the U.S. system in earlier years.
While certainly not discounting the value of training researchers to the PhD level, these observations would suggest that greater attention should
be given to the research orientation and training
within BSc and especially MSc programs at local
universities rather than simply seeking a high
proportion of PhDs through training abroad, par-

Ill

ticularly when such training may be of questionable relevance.
1.4. Commodity orientation
In less-developed countries, agricultural research is directed predominantly at crops. Based
on a sample of 83 countries, roughly two-thirds of
all agricultural researchers are engaged in work
related to crops. For the remainder, 19% are
engaged in livestock research, 7% in forestry research, and 6% in fisheries research.
There are some limited regional disparities in
the share of resources devoted to a particular
commodity orientation (Table 3). While such disparities are inevitable, given regional variations in
the pattern of production, it has been argued by
some that less research is devoted to fisheries and
forestry than their reported economic importance
warrants (see Mergen et a!., 1988, on forestry
research). In fact, the data - as shown in Table 3
- do not generally support this proposition. Research into forestry attracts more resources than
its congruent share in agricultural output in all
regions. In Asia and Pacific, and West Asia and
North Africa, this is also true of fisheries.
Nevertheless, the actual facilities for research
into forestry and fisheries are limited, primarily
because NARSs in less-developed countries are
generally small. The majority (73%) of them employ fewer than 200 researchers in total, while
only small percentages of these are engaged in
research into fisheries or forestry.

1.5. Factor shares

A major challenge for managers of research
systems is to make the most effective use of
available resources. The best mix of spending on
capital equipment, personnel and operating costs
will depend to a large degree on the relative
availability and cost of research inputs, their quality, and the type of research being conducted.
Since the most effective combination will differ
between regions and change within a system over
time, it is unrealistic to propose standards for
determining the 'optimal' mix of inputs in research. The data presented in this section should
be regarded as indications of magnitude based on
a sample of countries, not as economic optima
necessarily to be targeted.
The available data suggest that, in 1981-85,
NARSs in less-developed countries on average
devoted 19% of annual expenditures to capital
investment, compared with 8% in the U.S. The
higher share of spending on capital equipment by
NARSs in less-developed countries supports the
conclusion, also evidenced by their rapid growth,
that most are in an expansionary phase. During
this phase, not only must capital stock be replaced but additional capital stock must be acquired. The pattern of expenditures in the U.S.,
on the other hand, reflects that of a mature
system, most of whose capital spending entails
replacement of existing equipment. The emphasis
in the U.S. system has, moreover, been consistently towards greater investment in human capital rather than physical capital in recent years.
Today the system performs with around 14 cents
of physical capital for each dollar of human capital, compared with about 27 cents 50 years ago
(Pardey, Eveleens and Hallaway, forthcoming).
The contemporary pattern of expenditure in
less-developed countries mirrors that of U.S. experiment stations in their early years at the turn
of this century, when the share of capital in total
expenditures rose steadily to peak at 29% in
1912, before steadily falling. Capital (i.e., land,
buildings, equipment, etc.) has claimed the same
share of overall spending in U.S. research stations (about 8%) for the past three decades.
A second factor in the higher share of capital

costs in less-developed country NARSs is that
capital items are often relatively more expensive
in less-developed countries and they often lack
adequate repair and maintenance facilities, leading to an early write-off of equipment. Factor
substitution, where less expensive inputs are substituted for more expensive, may counterbalance
this effect somewhat, but it is not likely that it
will outweigh it.
Whereas salaries and operating costs in agricultural research expenditures represent service
flows, capital expenditures represent additions to
a stock. Thus, the high share of capital in annual
spending may also exaggerate the actual share of
capital in the services used to perform research.
Capital equipment can last for many years, and a
measure of service flow, rather than of expenditure, would probably reduce the share of capital
actually used by a research system in any given
year, particularly if such a system expands rapidly.
The recurrent costs of NARSs can be divided
between salaries and operating costs. In less-developed countries, salaries tend to be lower and
operating costs higher than in more-developed
countries. In 1981-85, a sample of 43 less-developed countries spent an average of $48,100 in
constant 1980 dollars per researcher, compared
with $91,200 per researcher in the U.S. The contemporary level of spending per researcher in
less-developed countries again appears to reflect
the situation in the early years of the U.S. experiment stations. In fact, in the U.S., total spending
per researcher fell steadily in the early years as
the recruitment of researchers outpaced rises in
research expenditures. In the first 30 years, real
operating expenditures per researcher fell to
roughly one-third of original levels and did not
recover until the 1970s - some 60 years later!
One of the major difficulties in making plausible cross-country comparisons of factor shares is
that cross-country differences in price levels,
which are not consistent across different expenditure items, act to confound the comparisons.
Thus, if spending on operating costs and salaries
is adjusted to take account of price differences
between countries, research in less-developed
countries is seen to be more labor-intensive relative to the U.S. Looked at this way, the share of

J.R. Anderson eta!. I Agricultural Economics 10 (1994) 107-123

operating costs in recurrent expenditures in
1981-85 averaged 15% in less-developed countries.
After adjusting for cross-country price differentials, operating expenditures per researcher are
also much smaller in less-developed regions than
in the U.S. Agricultural researchers in subSaharan Africa, Asia and Pacific, Latin America
and Caribbean, and West Asia and North Africa
work with only 50%, 43%, 74% and 22%, respectively, of the operating resources provided to a
U.S. researcher. However, the salary component
of recurrent expenditures (including the salaries
of both scientific and support staff) in the less-developed regions is much closer to the U.S. level.
And in sub-Saharan Africa it is even higher. This
may be accounted for by the relatively high number of expatriates still working in African NARSs
and the fact that the employment policies of
many governments in less-developed countries result in NARSs employing large numbers of support staff.
1.6. Size, scope, and spillovers

Since 1961-65, the average size of NARSs has
more than doubled, from around 400 to 910 researchers, as has average expenditure per system.
In less-developed countries the average size of
NARSs has increased from 155 to 630 full-time
equivalent researchers. Nevertheless, 95 of the
considered 130 NARSs in less-developed countries still employ fewer than 200 researchers, while
39 systems employ fewer than 25 researchers.
Only 14 employ more than 1000, illustrating that
the growth and development of NARSs in the
past two decades has diverged significantly.
When analyzing the cost structures and effectiveness of a NARS, one needs to consider both
the overall size and diversity of its operations and
the agricultural system it serves.
The evidence on whether or not research operations are subject to economies of size is limited
and far from definitive. In the case of a NARS,
considerations of economies of size are confounded by the fact that these systems generate a
wide diversity of products and services that vary
in their commodity, technology, and agroecologi-

113

cal specificity. For example, certain activities can
relate to improving crops or to developing new
breeds of plants suitable for specific agroecological zones within a country. Alternatively, research
can be devoted to developing improved crop and
soil management practices that will allow farmers
across a range of agroecological zones to increase
yields or improve pest and disease control.
Even in the absence of size economies with
regard to any particular line of research (e.g., a
particular commodity research program), a system may well be able to generate economies of
scope through a judicious choice in its portfolio
of research activities. Such scope economies arise
when a system can undertake a whole range of
research endeavors more cheaply than if these
endeavors were undertaken by separate research
entities. These economies can be achieved, for
example, by sharing staff, equipment, information, or know-how between different lines of research.
An important implication is that, when a system can create sufficiently strong economies of
scope, these can, in turn, lead to economies of
size across the whole range of its activities, even
if such economies of size do not arise for some
individual research programs (Baumol, Panzar
and Willig, 1988). Of course, there can also arise
diseconomies of scope, particularly among small
systems that spread their limited resources across
numerous research areas. Thus, small NARSs
will be unable to conduct research in all areas
that may warrant attention in the agricultural
systems they serve. They will have to make choices
between areas of study and this, in turn, requires
some specialization and flexibility in response to
opportunities as circumstances change.
The efficiency of a research system can also be
increased by adapting research conducted elsewhere to local circumstances. The ability to capture research spillovers is particularly important
for small NARSs with the capacity to do little
more than search and screening for suitable technologies. The best source of spillover would seem
to be neighboring countries with similar agricultural systems and agroecological features. This
strategy would require a policy of hiring staff for
their ability to adapt research to local situations

114

J.R. Anderson eta!./ Agricultural Economics 10 (1994) 107-123

rather than necessarily to carry out original research. It also requires flexibility in the research
system to identify and act upon opportunities
arising from developments elsewhere.
There is some disturbing evidence that many
smaller NARSs are unable to take up information quickly enough and that the knowledge they
work with is increasingly out-of-date. In a world
of growing international interconnectedness,
adapting spillovers from other research systems is
most effective if they can be adapted to local
circumstances in a timely manner. Using out-ofdate information only undermines a country's relative technological capacity and therefore its
competitiveness.
I. 7. Research and productivity

Research is best seen as an investment activity.
The research process itself takes time, and a
further period elapses before the results of research are taken up. Recent evidence suggests,
furthermore, that the benefits of research can

still have an effect in increasing output for as
long as 30 years after the research was initiated.
To consider gains in agricultural gross domestic
product (AgGDP) as a measure of the impact of
contemporaneous research expenditure could
thus be misleading. Differences in the quality of
land and labor, and in the intensity of use of
other inputs such as fertilizers and machinery,
will influence output and so distort international
comparisons of output that are measured only in
terms of research.
In fact, all the more- and less-developed regions steadily increased their research intensities
during that period (Table 4). In 1981-85, less-developed countries spent an average of nearly $4
per agricultural worker on research, 2.5 times the
amount spent two decades before. In more-developed countries, spending on research increased
4.4 times over the same period, to $214 for every
agricultural worker.
A final factor urging caution in assessing the
benefits of research in terms of increasing AgGDP
is that a large share of agricultural research may

be directed towards maintaining gains from earlier research rather than enhancing output levels
per se. Recent estimates suggest that, in the U.S.,
around one-third of research expenditures are
spent on maintenance, and it is probable that
many less-developed countries devote at least as
much proportional effort to such work (Adusei
and Norton, 1990).

2. International investments in agricultural
research

Contrary to the situation in many areas of
scientific research, there has always been an important element of international cooperation in
agricultural research. Much of this is due to the
legacy of the colonial relationships that existed at
the time institutionalized agricultural research
was developing.
One of the leading international organizations
in the field is the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), an umbrella body of around 40 donor countries and
international agencies that foster the activities of
some dozen supranational research centers. (Recently the number was enlarged to 18 but our
discussion here refers to the original 13.) Ten of
these centers have their headquarters in less-developed countries. Most are engaged in research
into either food commodities or agricultural production problems in a particular tropical region,
and three undertake worldwide research into specific commodities.
Established in 1971, the stated objective of the
CGIAR (CG for short), was to assist efforts to
increase food production in the less-developed
world. The goals were extended in 1990, in recognition of agriculture's broader role in economic
development, to helping less-developed countries
achieve self-reliance in food. Self-reliance is taken
to mean the capacity of a country to provide
sufficient food for its population, either directly
through local food production or indirectly by
generating agricultural exports that will allow food
to be imported.
In 1981-85, the CG accounted for only 1.8%
of global public-sector spending on agricultural

115

research, 4.3% if related to spending by and for
less-developed countries. Its budget rose, in nominal terms, from $20 million contributed by 20
donors in 1971, to $280 million from 40 donors in
1990. If corrected for inflation, the CG expenditures show clearly different phases of growth:
rapid expansion during the 1970s, slower growth
during the 1980s, and apparent stagnation or
even decline in the past few years.
The U.S. was the largest single donor to the
CG, although both Europe and Japan increased
their share of contributions during the 1980s. The
World Bank acted as a balancing "donor of last
resort," allocating its funds after other donor
intentions were known. It lately has contributed
around 15% of the system's total budget each
year.
During the 1980s, although the CG was established partly in response to the high levels of
poverty and hunger in Asia, the emphasis in the
allocation of funds has shifted to sub-Saharan
Africa. Between 1986 and 1988, sub-Saharan
Africa accounted for 39% of the CG's core expenditures, compared with 26% to Asia, 21% to
Latin America and Caribbean, and 14% to West
Asia and North Africa.
The "appropriate" regional allocation of funds
is just one of the policy issues facing the CG.
Although much of the increase in funding to
sub-Saharan Africa has been for special projects,
it is arguable that the concentration of resources
has swung too much towards that region at the
ultimate expense of Asia, which has several-fold
more poor than sub-Saharan Africa.
The commodity orientation of the system has
been subject to change over time. As the system
expanded, the share allocated to cereals research
declined steadily to about 40%, of which rice
research still accounts for the largest share at
17% of the system's total. Food crops, such as
potatoes, other roots and tubers, and legumes,
account for 24% of the total, while livestock
research accounts for around 20%. The remaining resources are allocated to noncommodity programs, including farming systems, food policy,
genetic resources, and NARS capacity building.
The recent expansion of the system has broadened the commodity coverage to include fish-

116

l.R. Anderson eta!./ Agricultural Economics 10 (1994) 107-123

eries, agroforestry and forestry, and bananas and
plantains. It may also eventually include horticultural commodities.
The recent reorientation of CG objectives to
emphasize self-reliance instead of self-sufficiency
in food was a recognition of the fact that increasing food production is not, in itself, a solution to
the hunger problem. Future policies must reflect
the role of agricultural growth as a means of
generating additional on-farm and off-farm income and employment, and the need to sustain
the natural-resource base on which continued
gains in agricultural productivity depend.
The CG's initial efforts were largely targeted
toward more favorable production environments.
Technology packages were developed that involved higher rates of fertilizer application, improved water management and cultural practices,
along with new crop cultivars that were particularly responsive to more intensified production
regimes. While the dramatic contribution of these
technology packages to increasing global food
supplies is unquestioned (Anderson, Herdt and
Scobie, 1988), by the mid-1970s the CG had also
begun to address production constraints in the
more marginal environments of the semi-arid and
(sub-)humid tropics.
At present, about 30% of CG funding is targeted towards technology for marginal lands,
which is roughly equal to the percentage of the
poor population in less-developed countries that
live in these areas. The issue of the relative
merits of seeking to improve or maintain productivity of favorable versus marginal lands will continue to be an important one for the CG, particularly with respect to the potential opportunity
costs (in terms of productivity gains foregone) of
diverting scarce research resources away from
more responsive areas towards the more marginal
ones. Analyses of the type reported by Byerlee
and Morris (1993) will be needed for guiding
future investment policy in this regard.
Research on resource management will become more important as the need for continued
increases in food production places an ever
greater strain on the world's natural resources.
The CG has taken the first step in this direction.
Strategies on how best to include agroforestry

and resource management concerns into its research program are currently being implemented.
This is being done by expanding the system and
redesigning its approach in order to incorporate
institutional entities that specifically address research concerns within an agroecological perspective. Aware of the fact that socioeconomic - not
just natural - conditions constrain the effectiveness and spillover potential of the system's research, this agroecological aspect is being overlaid on a geopolitical or regional dimension to
generate a so-called "ecoregional" perspective
(TAC/ Center Directors Working Group, 1993).

3. Private investments in agricultural research

Any formulation of future public-sector research policy must take into account the level of
activity and changing role of the private sector in
agricultural research. As farmers use more purchased inputs and the value-added in agriculture
increasingly moves off-farm to the marketing and
processing sectors, it is likely that the incentives
for private-sector investment in research will
grow. While there is a general perception that the
private-sector has increased its participation in
and funding of agricultural research, there are no
available data to give an accurate quantitative or
even qualitative perspective of these developments at the global, regional, and, in many instances, even country-level.
There are various reasons why these data are
not readily available. Firms may feel their competitive interests are not well served by a full and
frank disclosure of their R & D activities and so
may be less than forthcoming in this regard. Even
when such data are reported, there are genuine
difficulties in identifying the R & D component
that relates specifically to agriculture. This is
particularly a problem for multiproduct firms in
the chemical, pharmaceutical, biological and mechanical industries that pursue economies of
scope by sharing research resources across a
number of lines of research. Apportioning these
R & D expenditures to a particular country in any
meaningful way is also problematic, especially
when dealing with multinational firms that cen-

J.R. Anderson eta/. I Agricultural Economics 10 (1994) 107-123

tralize various aspects of their global or regional
R&D operations.
Recent estimates by Pray and Neumeyer (1989)
for the U.S. and Thirtle et al. (1991) for the UK
suggest that private-sector investments in agricultural and food (i.e., largely post-harvest) R&D
are substantial and at least as great as the public
effort. Reliable global estimates of private expenditures on agricultural R&D are simply unavailable. Persley (1990, p. 48) reports that about 540
million dollars were spent worldwide by the private sector on agricultural biotechnology research
in 1985, accounting for roughly 60% of the 900
million dollars spent on modern biotechnology
research for agriculture in that year. This
private-sector R&D figure is significantly larger
than the 36 million dollars Pray and Echeverria
(1991) estimate was spent annually by multinational companies on all types of agricultural (including post-harvest) R&D in less-developed
countries during the latter half of the 1980s.
Taken together these figures suggest that an
overwhelmingly large share of private-sector
spending on agricultural R&D occurs in the
more-developed countries.
The data reported by Pray and Echeverria
(1991) support this view. During the mid-1980s,
spending by U.S. firms on R&D in the food and
agricultural sectors was around 2.4 billion dollars
per annum (with about 58% of this total going to
agriculture). Comparable figures for the UK and
France are 530 million and 270 million dollars,
respectively. Much of the privately sourced funds
for agricultural R&D in the less-developed regions of the world comes from Latin America and
Asia and, according to Pray and Echeverria
(1991), it is concentrated in a few large countries
such as Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and India.
Our understanding of the scale and scope of
these private-sector efforts is, unfortunately, woefully inadequate. The recent and careful efforts
by Falconi (1992, 1993) to compile time-series
data on private-sector, agricultural R&D expenditures in Ecuador and Colombia are quite revealing in this respect. These new data show that,
in both countries, private-sector spending on agricultural R & D grew much more rapidly than publicly sourced expenditures during the 1980s. By

117

1991, the private sector accounted for 37% of
total agricultural R&D expenditures in Colombia
(compared with 22% in 1970) and in Ecuador the
private-sector share is now 27% (up from 19% in
1986). To the extent these developments are representative of the situation in other Latin American (and perhaps some Asian) countries, they call
for a radical rethink of the roles of the public-sector research agencies in these regions.
Having said this, however, there are still many
countries, especially in Africa, where the low
level of purchased inputs in agriculture limits the
size of the derived market for privately produced
agricultural technologies. This situation is likely
to continue for some time to come. Nevertheless,
governments have a number of policy instruments
with which to influence private R&D. Public-sector research can foster private-sector research by
providing (or selling) research results and by
training the personnel needed by private companies to conduct research. Patents and plant-variety
protection laws, if they are well designed and
enforced, can create the necessary incentives for
private companies to invest in R&D. Technology
imports can stimulate local R&D, so more liberalized technological trade could also increase local private-sector R & D activities.
Innovative institutional arrangements can also
help foster those complementarities that exist
when the generally more upstream or "pretechnology" types of research best suited to the public domain are married with the more applied,
technology-generating types of research best
suited to the private domain. For instance, jointventure research endeavors, where both public
and private agencies jointly undertake and/ or
cofinance a program of research are becoming
more frequent. Fee-for-service or contract research is also increasingly being used to privatize
the financing of research being performed by
public-sector research institutions.
Private, for-profit research should not be seen
as something intrinsically detrimental to the public good, but neither is it likely that an unfettered
private sector has the incentives to invest sufficiently in researching those problems that will
optimize social welfare. Public-policy formulators
will need to become increasingly sensitive to a

118

J.R. Anderson et al. I Agricultural Economics 10 (1994) 107-123

rapidly changing technological and institutional
environment in order to take advantage of the
opportunities that exist to mobilize both private
and public research resources in a socially desirable manner.

4. Political and financial support for agricultural
research

A fundamental task facing NARSs is to win
public support for research and translate it to
financial support. This must be done in the context of a public sector subject to competing claims
on its scarce resources from various interest
groups in society, be they producers, consumers,
or taxpayers.
From this perspective, governments give differential preference to various programs both within
and between sectors of the economy in response
to such pressures. Thus, agricultural expenditures
are committed to such programs as rural infrastructure, education and credit as well as to the
generation and dissemination of new agricultural
technologies. In addition, many poor countries
implement distortionary pricing and marketing
policies in the (short-run) pursuit of cheap-food
policies and the like, that ultimately tax agriculture and accelerate the transfer of resources from
the sector. These same policies, in part by undervaluing the sector-specific assets in agriculture
(e.g., land, irrigation facilities, etc.), can also lead
to an underinvestment in agricultural research
and the level of effort invested by farmers in
searching for, evaluating, and adapting new agricultural technologies and practices.
To gain a full understanding of the observed
disparities in the nature and level of support for
agricultural research (and the ultimate productivity effects that flow therefrom) would require
detailed consideration of these "political economy" forces - an exercise that would take us well
beyond our present brief (Gardner, 1990; Roe
and Pardey, 1993; Alston and Pardey, 1994).
Rather, the aim here is to present some comparative evidence on the level of support for public
agricultural research, and to place publicly funded

research in the context of the overall level of
support for agriculture. 2
A traditional measure of the level of support
for agricultural research is the agricultural research-intensity ratio that expresses levels of research spending as a percentage of agricultural
gross domestic product (AgooP ). Although the
majority of the less-developed countries spent
well above 0.5% of AgooP on agricultural research in 1981-85, the weighted average was only
0.4% (Table 5). This apparent difference between
simple and weighted average is caused by the fact
that the smaller less-developed countries tend to
have substantially higher agricultural research-intensity ratios than the large less-developed countries. The weighted average of the more-developed countries barely reached 2% in 1981-85.
The Southern European countries lagged significantly behind the other more-developed countries. When calculated by income group, a (not so

Elliott (1989).

J.R. Anderson et al. /Agricultural Economics 10 (1994) 107-123

surprising) strong correlation appears between
per-capita income and the agricultural researchintensity ratio.
Although agricultural research-intensity ratios
approximately doubled in both more- and less-developed countries between 1961-65 and 1981-85,
they declined in the latter half of that period in
37% of the less-developed countries, one-half of
which were in sub-Saharan Africa.
Research investment has traditionally produced high levels of return compared with investments in other areas, up to and exceeding 35% in
some instances (Echeverria, 1990). This fact, and
the gap in investment compared with more-developed countries, has led some authorities to conclude that many less-developed countries underinvest in agricultural research. It has also led to
calls from the World Bank, for example, to set a
research investment target of 2% of AgGDP
(World Bank, 1981).
Research-intensity ratios are useful to policymakers because they indicate the importance
other countries attach to agricultural research.
But they may be an unreliable indicator of the
appropriateness of a nation's research investment

119

because the efficacy of a country's research endeavor differs between regions and over time. It
could, therefore, be more helpful, instead of setting arbitrary targets for research investment, to
fix a desired rate of return from the investment
made - to set targets that would push rates of
return to below 20%, for example.
The data presented in Table 6 show that lowincome countries spend a considerably greater
share of overall public expenditures on agriculture and agricultural research than high-income
countries, around 11% on agriculture and 0.7%
on agricultural research, compared with 2.7%
and 0.2%, respectively, in high-income countries.
Moreover, the share of public expenditures on
agriculture directed specifically to research remains surprisingly constant, at around 8% in
1981-85, for both poor and rich countries alike.
To understand why this is so would involve, at
a minimum, a detailed consideration of the decision-making processes whereby public research
investments, pricing policies and the like are
jointly determined. Particular attention would
need to be given to the relative incidence of
research benefits and costs (across producers,

consumers and taxpayers) in relation to alternative policy instruments, be they investing in rural
public goods such as agricultural research versus
taxes, subsidies and production quotas (Alston
and Pardey, 1994). In the absence of available
case-by-case data, the macro-level figures in Table
7 are suggestive of some of the political economy
forces at work here.
While total government spending on agriculture, indexed over the agricultural population,
increases dramatically by a factor of 85 times,
from around $21 per capita in the low-income
countries to $1800 per capita in the high-income
countries, there is only a corresponding 8-fold
increase in agricultural spending indexed over the
total population. Per-capita spending on agricultural research follows a similar pattern. Thus, as
one moves from low- to high-income countries,
the level of per-capita "benefits" or transfers
accruing to rural-based coalitions may well increase at a disproportionately larger rate than the

per-capita incidence of "costs" associated with
such programs. If .this were the case, the willingness of rural-based coalitions to lobby governments in support of agricultural research (and
other forms of interventions that transfer resources to agriculture rather than the nonagricultural sector) may, in turn, be positively associated
with per-capita income. Modelling and quantifying governments' incentives to invest in rural public goods such as research is necessary but far
from sufficient to develop policies that help sustain support to public-sector agricultural research.
Donor support. While funding for agricultural research is only a small part of international development aid programs, it constitutes a significant
contribution to the financing of numerous lessdeveloped NARSs. Aid from donor countries or
organizations is particularly vital for countries
where high levels of international debt and an

inadequate tax base make it virtually impossible
for the national government to adequately support a viable agricultural research program.
There is a serious lack of data available on
precise levels of donor support to NARSs. What
available data there are, are difficult to standardize given the disparate reporting methods used
by NARSs as well as donors. Figures from donor
countries and organizations for the period 198185 put contributions to agricultural research at an
average of $658 million a year, which amounts to
a very modest 1.9% of total official development
assistance to less-developed countries. Based on
data from the NARSs, donor contributions in
that period amounted to only about $355 million
a year. This discrepancy can probably be explained by the fact that NARSs commonly underestimate the full extent of contributions they receive. In estimating donor support, NARSs, quite
understandably, often exclude payments in kind,
such as the salaries and expenses of expatriates
working for them, which can be a substantial
element of aid contributions. It is also difficult to
compile accurate figures on the amount of aid to
a research system when it is given as part of a
wider package of aid that is distributed through
the country's national government.
The available data suggest that, in real terms,
donor aid to NARSs has fallen since 1980 as
overall levels of development aid have stood still.
The World Bank accounts for around 25% of
donor funds applied to agricultural research in
the less-developed world, but the Bank's support
for individual national research endeavors declined during the 1980s. Moreover, this support is
concentrated in just a few NARSs. Of the $817
million it allocated to strengthen less-developed
NARSs during the period 1981-87, two-thirds
went to only six projects.
The levels of external funding to national systems vary enormously, from none in Venezuela
and South Korea to 85% in Tuvalu. Sub-Saharan
Africa had the highest rate of donor funding,
receiving on average 35% of its expenditures from
donors. NARSs in the Asia and Pacific region
received an average of 26% of their funding from
donors. The levels of donor support to NARSs in
Latin America and Caribbean, and West Asia

121

and North Africa were much lower, 7% and 11%,
respectively.

5. Concluding observations

While the past contributions of agricultural
research to productivity gains and the improvements in living standards that followed have been
impressive, the challenges that lie ahead are considerable indeed. There will be unprecedented
increases in the demand for additional food and
fibre production while the threats to even achieving, let alone sustaining, such levels of output in
the face of a degrading natural resource base for
agriculture loom large. Such threats appear as
real for the more-favored, intensively cultivated
production environments as they are for the more
marginal areas (Pingali, 1994).
There are unlikely to be any quick technological "fixes" to addressing these concerns. In fact,
for the more immediate term at least, maintaining as well as enhancing past productivity increases is likely to come from the incremental
gains arising from a whole array of new technologies and management practices (Byerlee, 1994).
While individually less "newsworthy" than the
Green-Revolution technologies of the past, these
sources of growth, when taken as a group, will
nevertheless be just as real.
But to realize these output gains in a manner
that preserves the environment will require a
sustained commitment to national and international research endeavors. While many countries
experienced a substantial growth in their research
capacity in the 1960s and 1970s, a considerable
number saw an erosion of their public-sector research capacity in the 1980s. Although privately
sponsored research endeavors are sure to grow in
the future, the corollary is not necessarily to cut
back on public-sector investments. In fact, the
substantial growth in privately sponsored research in the U.S. over the past several decades
occurred in conjunction with a continued, albeit
slower, growth in public-sector research investments.
To fully harness the potential complementarities and synergy between public and private re-

122

J.R. Anderson et al. /Agricultural Economics 10 (1994) 107-123

search endeavors will require that more attention
be given to each sector's comparative research
advantage. In particular, the gains to researching
improved agricultural management and production practices - those that will play a large role in
realizing sustainable improvements in agricultural
output - are generally difficult to appropriate
and likely to remain the domain of the public
sector. So too are the more basic, pretechnology
types of research that, in turn, lay the foundations for the privately-sponsored applied and
adaptive research programs of tomorrow. Failure
to support and nurture today's research endeavors may well reap many unfortunate and undesired consequences in the not-too-distant future.
