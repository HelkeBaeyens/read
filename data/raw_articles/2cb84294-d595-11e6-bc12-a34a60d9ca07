Abstract
A shadow-price profit frontier model is developed to examine production efficiency of Chinese rural households in farming operations.
The model incorporates price distortions resulting from imperfect market conditions and socioeconomic and institutional constraints, but
retains the advantages of stochastic frontier properties. The shadow prices are derived through a generalized profit function estimation. The
shadow-price profit frontier is then estimated and an efficiency index based on the estimated profit frontier is computed and decomposed to
household characteristics. Empirical results using data from China's Rural Household Survey for 1991 reject the neoclassical profit
maximization hypothesis based on market prices in favor of the general model with price distortions. Farmers' resource endowment and
education influence their response to the market restrictions, thus alter their performance in terms of efficiency. The estimated efficiency
index ranges from 6% to 93% with a sample average of 62%. Households' educational level, family size and per capita net income are
positively related to production efficiency. Households living in mountain areas or with family members employed by the government or
state industries are relatively inefficient. Reducing market intervention, allowing right of use of farm land to be transferred among
households, encouraging migration of excess farm labor, and promoting farmers' education will improve rural households' efficiency in
agricultural production.

1. Introduction
The efficiency gains from improving resource
allocation resulting from economic reforms in
China's agriculture have been dramatic. Fan ( 1991)
estimated that about 63% of the productivity change
(at an average of 2.13% per year, 1965-1985) is
attributable to improvement in efficiency. Lin ( 1992)
found that the productivity change resulting from
various reforms made up 42.23% of the output growth
during 1978-1984, and no increasing trend in technological change was detected. Central to this transformation towards free markets in Chinese agricul-

ture is the behavior of the individual rural household.
With the Rural Household Responsibility System
(RHRS) the basic production unit was shifted from
collectivized farms to the rural households. Other
reforms allowed for the sale of commodities to private parties and the free flow of surplus rural labor
to local industries and urban areas. The agricultural
sector responded to these reforms with increased
production for most major commodities due to productivity gains. With the full implementation of
RHRS nationwide in 1983-1984, the question of
whether production efficiency is still a great potential for productivity growth remains unanswered.
Although the economic reforms have greatly reduced
direct control by government over production, various interferences in agricultural markets still distort

farmers' production decisions. The relationships between efficiency and market indicators and household characteristics have not been well studied in
this unfolding process of agricultural reform. A better understanding of these relationships should aid
policymakers in creating improved efficiency-enhancing policies and in judging the efficacy of past
reforms. These relationships are also of interest to
policymakers in other nations where government
plays a major role in traditional agriculture.
Production efficiency is usually analyzed by separately examining its two components: technical efficiency and allocative efficiency. Recent developments reported in the literature combine both measures into one system. This approach enables more
efficient estimates to be obtained by simultaneously
estimating the system (e.g. Kumbhakar, 1989; Kalirajan, 1990). However, previous research (post-1978)
on Chinese agricultural productivity focused on total
factor productivity, while technical efficiency and
allocative efficiency were rarely examined 1•
Although stochastic production frontier functions
are most commonly used in studying production
efficiency, Yotopoulos and others argued that a production function approach may not be appropriate
when estimating the production efficiency of individual farms because they may face different prices and
have different factor endowments (Ali and Flinn,
1989). An attempt to incorporate firm level prices
and input use led to profit function formulation. The
early development of profit function models did not
provide a numerical measure of firm specific efficiency (Aigner et al., 1977). Ali and Flinn (1989)
directly estimated farm-specific efficiency from a
random coefficient profit frontier function using
market prices. In general, the use of standard dual
representations of the production structure requires
the corresponding maintained hypotheses of cost
minimization or profit maximization, subject to parametric market prices. Thus, in the case of regulated
industries or imperfect markets, as in China, these
hypotheses may be invalid.
A generalized profit function (behavioral profit
1 Most post-1978 productivity studies focused on the effects of
institutional changes on output and productivity growth (e.g. Lin,
1992; McMillan et al. (1989); Fleisher and Liu ( 1992). Only Ma
et al. (1989) examined efficiency at farm level.

function) approach which incorporates market distortions resulting from imperfect market conditions has
been developed in the literature. Kumbhakar and
Bhattacharyya (1992) developed a behavioral profit
function to test the appropriateness of a neoclassical
profit function and the effect of education and farm
size on allocative performance. Their model, however, does not provide a numerical measure of profit
efficiency for each farm. A more recent study conducted by Ali et al. (1994) employed both stochastic
frontier and behavioral profit functions separately in
a study of Pakistan agriculture. The rejection of
profit maximization based on observed market prices
from the behavioral profit function, however, indicates that their stochastic frontier function, which
was specified by using observed market prices, is
subject to misspecification. Regarding post-1978
Chinese agricultural efficiency studies, very few employed the dual approach and none incorporated
market distortions.
The objective of this study is to analyze production efficiency of farm households facing various
market constraints in Chinese agriculture. An estimation process that incorporates market distortions but
retains the advantages of stochastic frontier properties in efficiency analysis is developed in this study.
China's Rural Household Survey data for 1991 are
used for the empirical analysis. First~ a behavioral
profit function is used to derive farmers' shadow
prices. Then a stochastic frontier profit function,
using the shadow prices obtained from the behavioral profit function, is estimated and the efficiency
index is derived and related to farm households'
demographic variables to identify the factors that
affect farm households' efficiency.

2. Modeling market distortions and the stochastic
profit frontier
Given the existence of binding constraints on
decision-making, as revealed by a number of studies
(e.g. Toda, 1976; Atkinson and Halvorsen, 1980;
Kumbhakar and Bhattacharyya, 1992), the producers' decision is often made with respect to shadow
prices-i.e. the prices that they actually paid and
received, rather than observed market prices. The
divergence between the shadow and observed market
prices can be interpreted as the result of various

J. Wang et al.j Agricultural Economics 15 (/996) 17-28

market constraints, as well as allocative inefficiency
caused by errors in optimization. One commonly
used measure of the divergence between the two
prices, based on Lau and Yotopoulos (1971), is to
define a relationship between the normalized shadow
price, p' ( w' for input), and the normalized market
price, p ( w), as P} = ej pj and w: = ei W;, where ej
and ei are (non-negative) price efficiency parameters. The subscripts j and i index outputs and inputs,
respectively. If there are no bending market restrictions then () equals unity. Thus, a farmer is allocatively efficient with respect to observed market prices
only when the observed market prices reflect the
farmer's opportunity cost of inputs and outputs 2 •
Based on the above settings, a profit-maximizing
farmer's behavior can be expressed by specifying a
behavioral profit (shadow profit) function, 1T * =
7T( p', w', z) in the translog form, normalized by one
input price, as:
n-1

ln7T

where j,k = 1,2 ... M are number of outputs, i,l =
1,2 ... N-1 are number of inputs, q,h= 1,2 ... Q
are number of fixed inputs, (e1p) and (e;w) are
normalized shadow prices of outputs and inputs respectively, and z" are quantities of fixed inputs.
Eq. (1) cannot be directly estimated to measure
the profit efficiency 3 because the shadow prices are
unobserved, and so is the shadow profit 1T *. In an
empirical sample, however, whether or not a good
approximation of the shadow profit ( 1T * ) exists depends on the specification of 1T *, as well as on
survey design and the data collection mechanism.
Given the shadow profit 1T * defined in Eq. (1),
directly reported net returns that a farmer actually
obtained from his operation under the market distortion can be a close approximation of 1T * in the data
set to be used in this study 4 • To make estimation of
Eq. (1) possible, we need information on () for the
shadow prices. The following transformation serves
the purpose.

2 Allocative efficiency is evaluated from the producer's point of
view of profit maximization. It does not necessarily reflect social
costs and therefore is not necessarily efficient in the sense of
social cost-benefit assessment. It is also to be noted that the
effects of errors in optimization on allocative efficiency cannot be
separated from market distortions in this setting. Thus, the price
efficiency parameter e may contain a combined source of price
inefficiency.

3 This study combines the concepts of technical and allocative
efficiency in the profit relationship. Within a profit function
context, profit efficiency is defined as the capability of a farm to
achieve the highest possible profit given the prices and level of
fixed factors. Since there were very limited market alternatives for
farmers in China to market their products in 1991, much of their
returns was determined by production decisions rather than market
decisions. Thus, the profit efficiency actually measures farmers'
production efficiency.
4 Further discussion will be given in the data section.
5 The terminology of 'actual profit' used for 'ITa= '£p y 1 1
L.w;x; in the literature is misleading. 7Ta states what a farmer's
profit would be if there were no market distortions or what the
profit would be if the market prices were used for profit calculation based on the farmer's choices of y1 and x; made under
market distortions. Since the market prices are not necessarily
equal to the prices that the farmer actually paid and received, 1ra
is not the actual profit that the farmer truly obtained from his
practice in the distorted market.

Substituting xn from Eq. (3) into Eq. (2) and

Further, by specifying a translog function for the

where farmers' actually paid (received) prices are
different from observed market prices and the farmers directly reported their actual profit or total revenue and total costs based on the prices they actually
paid (received). In such a case, 7T * , the profit that
farmers actually obtained in a distorted market, contains more information than 7T a does 6 •
Although the shadow prices are eliminated, Eq.
(6) still contains the unobserved price efficiency
parameters, oj and 0;, which are latent variables.
They are assumed to be farm-specific in order to
reflect an individual farmer's response to market
distortions. Since one of our objectives is to examine
whether education and relative resource endowment
have any influence on price response to market
distortions, we model 0 as follows for each input
and output price:

Further, a profit shifter can be formed to capture
technical efficiency across households. Following
Kumbhakar and Bhattacharyya ( 1992), technical efficiency is modeled as a function of farm size, FS, and
the household labor's highest educational level

It is worth noting that we specify 7T

6 In cases where 7r • is unknown, a more generalized alternative which uses fitted 7T * has been developed by Wang, Wailes
and Cramer.
7 A preliminary statistical analysis shows that the labor /land
ratio is correlated with several farm characteristic variables, such
as farm size, off-farm employment, machinery use, because these
variables are mainly affected by the scarcity of land and abundance of labor in China's agriculture.

estimated to obtain the estimated price efficiency
parameter (} and the effects of FS and EL on technical efficiency.
The second step is to construct a stochastic
shadow-profit frontier function. The estimated (}
values from the first step are used to derive the
shadow prices. The shadow prices are used directly
as arguments in the translog profit function (Eq. (1))
with an error term, g;, which is assumed to behave in
a manner consistent with the stochastic frontier concept:

(IO)
It is assumed that v;, reflecting random disturbance, is normally distributed, while u; is a one-sided
disturbance term used to represent the inefficiency
measures. We assume u; has a half-normal nonnegative distribution, [N(O,a})l. The population average efficiency is given as:

(II)
where F is the standard normal distribution function.
Following Jondrow et al. ( I982), the farm-specific
estimates of inefficiency, u;, for each observation are
derived from the conditional distribution of u;, given

gi = V; + U;:

E( u;l g;) =

a;:v [I ~~C~:)u) - g~A]

=

u;'
( I2)

where u} and u} are the variance of V; and u;.
A= uufuv, u 2 = u} + u}, and f and F are the
standard normal density and cumulative distribution
functions, respectively, estimated at g; A/ u.
Finally, the farm-specific efficiency index
(exp[- u;']) can be constructed using the results
from Eq. ( I2). Since the inefficiency term u; is
truncated at zero by the assumption of the frontier
function, a truncated regression of a semi-log efficiency index against household demographic variables provides an appropriate decomposition of the
efficiency index.

3. Data and empirical estimation
The data used for this empirical application are a
subsample of China's National Rural Household Sur-

21

vey for 1991. This survey, started in 1955 by the
General Organization of Rural Socio-Economic Survey of the State Statistical Bureau (SSB), evolved
from the Chinese Rural Household Expenditure Survey initiated in the late 1970s. Since 1984, a multistage sampling procedure combined with interval
sampling at the lowest level has been used in the
survey design to ensure the random nature of the
sample and to minimize sampling errors (State Statistical Bureau of China, 1993). The survey records
all major production and consumption activities of
70 000 participating households during the survey
year.
Farmers' production activities were influenced by
various market distortions which mainly came from
government intervention. By I991, for example, the
state contract purchase for a specified quantity of
output at a price fixed below the market price and
the procurement of amounts that exceeded the contract quantities under the so-called 'negotiated
prices', which in most cases were also lower than
market prices, were major government influences in
agricultural output markets. In the agricultural input
markets, government-owned businesses delivered
farm inputs, such as chemical fertilizers and diesel
fuel, at low fixed prices to producers for many years.
To facilitate procurement, the government has often
used input subsidies to induce cooperation from
farmers 8 .
Other sociopolitical and institutional constraints
faced by Chinese farmers also cause market distortions. For instance, there are always shortages in
major material input supplies such as fertilizer. Some
farmers may be able to obtain an adequate supply of
fertilizer at the state distribution prices because of
their personal relationship with state agencies, while
others may have to pay a 'shortage premium'. Village leaders andjor families with non-farm-workers
may have special privileges, such as access to credit
or receive cash payment for their sales to the state

8 Since 1993, China has brought reforms to its input supply
system. Currently, a wide variety of businesses owned collectively
and by the government are delivering inputs to rural area (US
Department of Agriculture, 1993). However, the state planning
system still imposes quantitative restrictions on farmers' access to
subsidized inputs (Ye and Rozelle, 1994).

22

purchasing organizations, while others are forced to
accept the state's use of promissory notes (IOU)
instead of cash for their products 9 . In many cases,
special fees have been levied by local governments
on farmers that are related to procurement and input
supply. In these situations, the actual prices received
and paid by farmers are different from what has been
observed in the market because of the existence of
these non-price restrictions.
The subsample used in this study is randomly
selected from the national sample 10 • For the analysis
in this study, 1786 observations were used. The
survey contains no price variables. All farm-specific
price variables in the analysis are unit values, imputed by using quantity and expenditure or revenue
variables 11 • When imputed values are not possible
(i.e. the household did not produce or purchase a
specific output or input), the missing prices are set
according to the average of the province where the
household is located. Price indices for outputs and
variable inputs are constructed using the Divisia
index:

(13)
where lnpf is the price index for the jth aggregate
for the hth household, r;~ is the share of the ith item
in the jth aggregate for the hth household, lnpt is
the price of the ith item in the jth aggregate for the
hth household, r;j and lnp;j are the averages of the
shares and prices for all households in the sample,
respectively. The base for these indices is the aver-

9 Well into the 1991 harvest season, some provinces had reportedly not completely paid off IOUs on the 1990 harvest (US
Department of Agriculture, 1991 ).
10 Several changes were made on the experimental design of the
survey samples between 1950 and 1990. This may raise the
question of consistency in a time series study, but it should not
affect our use of a cross-section sample. Since the subsample we
used in the analysis is randomly selected from the survey, the
inadequate randomness and lack of sampling weight should not
limit our statistical reference drawn from the random sample.
11 The survey requires participating households to record only
immediate revenue and cost without any associated benefits or
expenditures for each sale or purchase. For example, if a farmer
made a trip to buy some fertilizer, his travel and fertilizer transportation expenses would not be recorded under 'fertilizer expenditure' but under 'other expenditure'.

age of the sample. Two output prices of crops and
livestock, two variable input prices of chemical fertilizer and other purchased materials (including fuel,
seeds, plastic sheets, pesticides, etc.), and three fixed
inputs of labor (no hired labor was recorded), land
and capital are aggregated from various of outputs
and inputs recorded in the data set. Through the
above aggregation, all households in the sample
produced the two outputs and used the two variable
inputs.
For the non-land capital inputs, it is assumed that
the service flow from the stock of capital is proportional to the stock. Consequently, a certain percentage of the stock value can be used as a proxy for the
service flow. Land is taken as the total area of
cultivated land including both contracted areas and
private plots. The labor variable is defined as the
total number of male-equivalents engaged in agricultural production. These fixed inputs are expressed in
index form with the average of the sample used as a
base. For the variables FS and EL in Eq. (9), four
dummy variables-SF (small farm), LF (large farm),
LE (low education) and HE (high education)-are
constructed to distinguish relative farm size and the
highest education level household labor achieved.
The selected household demographic variables are
family size, per capita net income, whether the
household has any family member operating as a
village leader or employed by government or state
industries, and the household's geographic
location 12 •
Profit is defined as total revenue (including selfconsumption and storage) minus total variable costs.
The data contain households' total revenue and total
variable costs which are directly reported by the
survey households for their operations of crops and
livestock. The data also record the households' pro-

12 The sample mean for FS is 12.8 mu (I mu equals 1/15 ha).
The small (large) farms are the households that operate less
(great) than 1.3 (100) mu of land. Lower education level is
assigned if EL is primary school or less. Higher education level is
assigned if EL is high school or college graduate. For the dummy
variables used in the efficiency decomposition regression, small
(large) families are the households having less (more) than three
(six) people. High (low) income households are assigned if the
household's per capita net income is greater (less) than 1000 (500)
yuan. They are arbitrarily determined.

factors used for the operations. A means test shows
that the means of the farmers' directly reported
revenues and costs are significantly different from
those computed using market prices. The differences
may be caused by the existence of market restrictions and the prices used in valuing products of

23

inventory and direct household consumption 13 • To
be consistent with the argument that 7T * contains
more information than 7T" does, the revenues and
costs directly reported by the farmer are used to
generate the shadow profit for 7T *.
In the first-step estimation, Eq. (6) is estimated
using sj and sf derived from the non-distorted
translog profit function On1r") to obtain estimates for
the price efficiency parameters (e). It is necessary to
substitute the price efficiency parameters 8 in Eq.
(7) with the regional intercept in Eq. (8) and to add
Eq. (9) to measure the technical efficiency. The
model is estimated using a non-linear iterative seemingly unrelated regression (ITSUR) technique with
symmetry and homogeneity conditions imposed.
Kmenta and Gilbert (1968) have shown that the
parameters estimated from the ITSUR procedure
converge to maximum likelihood estimates. The estimates are reported in Table 1. In the second-step
estimation, the behavioral (shadow-price) profit function (Eq. (1)) with all price variables adjusted by the
estimated 8, along with the error term gi = v; + u;,
is estimated by the stochastic frontier technique
(LIMDEP, Green, 1992) to obtain the shadow-profit
frontier. The estimated coefficients are given in Table

With the estimation of Eq. (6), the hypothesis of
profit maximization based on market prices is tested
by imposing the parameter restrictions of eb = 1 for
all b. The value of the test statistic is 19. Compared

13 The enumerators in each county construct the local prices
used to evaluate products of inventory and own-consumption
according to an average market price for each commodity at its
peak season. Since the proportions of inventory and own-consumption varies across households (national average of own-consumption for grain products was 49.4% in 1990), the effect of
these constructed prices on profit will not be reflected by the
county dummy variables.
14 To save space, the estimates of the county dummy variables

with the critical value 16.92 of x 2 with 9 degrees of
freedom at the 0.05 level of significance, the restricted market price model is rejected in favor of the
model with market distortion and allocative inefficiency. The test result indicates that profit maximization based on market prices may be inappropriate.
Thus, the shadow profit model that incorporates
market distortions is more suitable for this data
sample 15 •
The estimated farm-specific price efficiency parameters for crops (0 1), livestock (0 2 ), and chemical
fertilizer (0) are computed for all observations. On
average, 0 1 takes the value of 0.84 with 99% of the
individual values less than one. The mean for 0 2 is
found to be 0.86 and 96% of the individual values
were less than one, indicating that the 'prices' actually received by farmers for their products of crops
and livestock are less than the observed market price
because of the existence of market distortions. On
the input side, the mean of the farmers' shadow price
of using chemical fertilizer is greater than the observed market price based on a mean for the estimated Oc of 1.16 with 53% of the individual values
greater than one.
The estimated values of 0 1,02 and Oc show that a
farm household's educational level and laborjland
ratio, as two primary variables of resource endowment, influence its allocative performance. The estimated values of 0 1, and Oc approach unity as the
level of education increases, holding the labor/land
ratio at the mean level (the estimated coefficient on
education for 0 2 is not significant). This result indicates that the level of education improves allocative
efficiency. The estimates of households' laborjland
ratio exhibit a mixed effect on allocation performance. For example, a higher ratio raises the distortion effect on crops (in bringing 0 1 below unity); on
the other hand, it reduces the distortion effect on
livestock production and fertilizer use (in bringing
the 0 2 and Oc close to unity) when holding education
at the mean level. These results may reflect the fact
that small-sized crop farms bear much output price

15 Lopez (1985) shows that empirically the most flexible functional forms do not satisfy the properties of monotonicity and
convexity globally. We did not test these properties for our profit
function.

distortion while some livestock producers may take
advantage of specialization in livestock production.
The estimated coefficients of technical efficiency
variables show that the larger farms tend to be
relatively technically efficient ( T 1L = 0.83) and the
small farms are technically inefficient ( T 1s = - 0.57).
Based on the estimated price efficiency parameters (0) from the first step, a maximum-likelihood
estimate of the shadow profit frontier (Eq. (1) with
Eq. (10)) is obtained and a profit efficiency index is
derived. The mean of the profit efficiency measure,
E(e-u), is 0.62. This result implies that an average
of 38% of profit is lost due to inefficiency. The
frequency distribution of the individual household's

J. Wang et al.j Agricultural Economics 15 ( 1996) 17-28

efficiency index (Table 3) shows that there is a wide
variation in the level of efficiency among households. The efficiency estimates range from 0.06 to
0.93. About 11.8% of households are in an efficiency range below 0.50. The standard errors of the
inefficiency factor (a) contribute 91% to that of the
total error term ( u ), which indicates that the inefficiency term dominates the total error term. These
results imply that a considerable amount of profit
can be obtained by improving technical and allocative efficiency in Chinese agriculture.
The derived farm-specific efficiency index facilitates decomposition of the efficiency performance at
the farm level. Such analyses allow us to identify the
factors that influence farmers' efficiencies. Table 4
contains the estimates of the truncated regression of
the efficiency decomposition that explains relationship between a household's profit efficiency and its
demographic characteristics. The results show that a
household's educational level, family size and per
capita net income are positively related to its efficiency. Households in mountain areas and households with family members employed by the government or state industries are relatively inefficient 16 •
The estimated coefficients also show relatively large
magnitude of net per capita income (0.40 for high
net income and - 0.17 for low net income) and
household size (0.14 for a large family and - 0.25
for a small family) to efficiency performance. These
results demonstrate the existence of economies of
size in China's household farming system. The positive coefficients for a more highly educated household and village leader, although of relatively small
magnitude, may reflect these households' privileges
on accessing technology and market information.
To verify how close a farmer's shadow profit can
be approximated by his directly reported profit in the

16 Most off-farm employees, especially those employed by the
government and state industries, are married males. Their wives
and children have remained in rural households. Farm-land was
distributed basically according to the number of people in each
household; therefore, relative lack of labor and experience causes
lower efficiency. In general, this kind of household has less
incentive to improve its performance because its well-being depends on off-farm income.

survey, and to evaluate the effect of this approximation on the farmer's efficiency analysis, we performed a sensitivity analysis by using predicted
shadow profit from a predicted shadow-profit model
suggested in Wang et al. (1996). The distribution of
the estimated efficiency index and its decomposition
from the predicted profit model are very close to that
derived from the model developed in this study. Both
models yield the same mean of the profit efficiency,
0.62. The predicted profit model estimates a slightly
larger proportion of households (12.5% compared to
11.8%) with an efficiency level below 0.50. The
results of the efficiency decomposition (Table 4)
show that the estimates from two different models
are comparable. The sign of the estimates between
the two models is the same for each variable. The
magnitude of the estimates, as well as level of
statistic significance, are similar between the two
groups of estimates. This result indicates that farmer
directly reported profit can be used as a proxy of
shadow profit in shadow-profit analysis to simplify
the estimation procedures. It also indicates the robustness of estimates obtained from the model specified in this study.
The estimated parameters of the county dummy
variables show that there are significant differences

in average profit across the regions. The county
dummy variables explain 20.45% of total sample
variations in this model and 25.56% in the predicted
profit model. This result indicates that regional differences in socioeconomic conditions have a substantial influence on profit patterns among rural households in China. Further discussion of the regional
effects, however, is beyond the scope of this study.

5. Summary and policy implications
This study uses a profit function approach which
combines technical and allocative efficiency in the
profit relationship to analyze farm households' production efficiency in China. To address the existence
of various market distortions in Chinese agriculture,
we adopt a concept of shadow-price profit frontier in
this study. Measurement and decomposition of the
households' production efficiency are obtained by
estimating the shadow profit frontier function, which
incorporates price distortions resulting from imperfect markets, socioeconomic and institutional constraints. Empirical results using 1991 China's Rural
Household Survey data indicate that a profit-maximizing farm's decision on outputs and inputs is
based on their shadow prices rather than observed

market prices. It is also found that there is a significant variation in production efficiency among farm
households in China. Estimated production efficiency, measured by the profit efficiency index, range
from 6% to 93%, with 11.8% percent of the farm
households' efficiency levels being lower than 50%.
The mean of the profit efficiency is 62%, which is
close to the 69% for the coastal region and the 48%
for the central region found in Wu (1995) using
1985-1991 provincial data. These results suggest a
great scope for improvement in production efficiency.
The profit efficiency is significantly explained by
the production-related characteristics and farm management practices. In particular, farmers' education,
farm size and per capita net income are important
variables to raise profit efficiency. The factors affecting profit efficiencies negatively are small family
size (less than three people) and low per capita net
income. Households living in mountain areas and
households with family members employed in the
government or state industries are profit inefficient.
Given the existing regime of input and output
prices in China's agriculture, one conclusion that can
be drawn from this study is that effects of price
distortions must be considered in farm behavior studies. This model has implicitly internalized these distortions through the shadow prices. Rejection of the
market price model indicates that opportunity costs
of resources are not reflected by the observed market
prices when there are binding external constraints
and allocative inefficiency. Thus, empirical studies
that use profit (cost) function with observed market
prices as the opportunity costs of resources may give
inappropriate results.
The second conclusion drawn from the study is
that a great potential of efficiency gain can be obtained by reducing market distortions in China's
agriculture. The Rural Household Responsibility System, as the first phase of the rural economic reforms
that focused on the production operating mechanism,
has substantially improved farm households' efficiency. Although rural input and output market reforms have been implemented since 1985, various
market constraints still remain effective in preventing farm households' optimum resource allocation.
The significant differences between the market prices
and farmer's opportunity costs, found in this study,

J. Wang et al.j Agricultural Economics 15 (1996) 17-28

implies that farm households' allocative efficiency is
influenced by the market distortions.
The study also finds evidence that economies of
scale exist in China's household farming system.
Both technical efficiency and allocative efficiency
are positively related to operational size, which is
also partly determined by family size and per capita
net income.
The above findings have important policy implications. All previous studies reveal that a substantial
improvement in China's agricultural production efficiency has occurred from the institutional changes
made from 1978 to 1984. With the full implementation of the household responsibility system nationwide in 1983-1984, slow growth in crop production
and productivity has shifted the focus of agricultural
development towards technical change. This study
indicates that substantial productivity gains can be
obtained by continuously improving farm households' production efficiency. Both technical and a)locative efficiencies can be improved by eliminating
market distortions that mess up the function of price
signal and cause allocative inefficiency. In particular,
removing the government's monopsonistic power and
administrative forces on major agricultural product
procurement and purchase of quota obligations in the
output market should allow market prices to reflect
the opportunity costs of the products. In the input
market, promoting the supply of inadequate material
inputs, such as chemical fertilizer and fuel, rather
than rationing and price subsidies, could eliminate
the 'shortage premium' paid by some farmers and
over-use of the inputs by others. A more liberalized
market enables production (profit) to return to its
frontier from the interior and shifts the frontier upward. The reason for this shift is that the potential of
the economic reforms and modem technologies appears to be underestimated because the best practice
farms, which are basis for estimating the potential,
would probably also be constrained by socioeconomic and institutional factors.
The study also suggests that potential efficiency
gain can be achieved by increasing a household's
operating scale. In particular, allowing a relatively
scarce resource, land, to be transferred to households
with a high labor /land ratio should increase the
production efficiency of these crop farms. Consequently, improved resource use requires development

27

of a land rental market or a well-conducted land use
right transfer mechanism as a complement to the
land contract system 17 • The market can pick winners
and losers and allocate land to those who can utilize
it efficiently.
Clearly, a farm household's production efficiency
is affected by its management practices and the
farm's production-related characteristics, which in
tum are influenced by socioeconomic conditions. For
instance, a farmer's management capability is influenced by school availability and cost of schooling. It
is thus important for China's agricultural development to have an institutional environment that facilitates the farmers' accessibility to education, and
provides a socioeconomic environment that encourages market exchange in land and labor.

17 Under the original land contract system, land is equally
distributed to households on a per capita basis. Currently, there is
not a well-defined land market in China. Sales of farmland are
very rare. However, the right of land use can be transferred in
accordance with the law that was approved on l 2 April 1988, and
farmers have found a way to transfer land use rights through
village committees and township government that manage the
land contract system (Zhang and Makeham, 1992; US Department
of Agriculture, l 993).
