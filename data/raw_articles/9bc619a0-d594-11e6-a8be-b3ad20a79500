ABSTRACT
Dinar, A. and Yaron, D., 1992. Adoption and abandonment of irrigation technologies.
Agric. Econ., 6: 315-332.
Adoption and abandonment processes are analyzed for seven irrigation technologies. A
procedure is developed to estimate the technology cycle and applied to data available for
citrus groves in several regions of Israel, and Gaza. The technology cycle was used to
estimate diffusion-abandonment patterns for several irrigation technologies that have been
abandoned. Results suggest that the technology cycle is unique to each technology and
similar in length for all regions. Results predict the year of full abandonment of each
technology. For modern technologies still in the diffusion phase, a logistic equation was
fitted to the aggregated data. Results suggest that diffusion is significantly affected by
economic variables such as water price, crop yield price, and subsidy for irrigation equipment. Use of the estimated equations for policy purposes suggest that water price and
subsidy for irrigation equipment can be used to control the diffusion process (speed and
ceiling) of the irrigation technologies.

sion of technologies have estimated rates of adoption and levels of adoption until the stage when the process reaches its ceiling (e.g., Jarvis, 1981;
Jansen, Walker and Barker, 1990). Less attention has been devoted to the
stage when the innovation is abandoned, which occurs at least as frequently
in the history of technological changes. A discontinuance of technology can
be the result of technological substitution (Fisher and Pry, 1971; Rogers,
1983; Cameron and Metcalfe, 1987) which creates technology cycles.
In the development of new technologies it is essential for the developer,
or the policy maker, to estimate the expected life span of the technology in
order to analyze the effects of possible policy variables on the resulting
number of users of that technology (or any other measure for intensity of
use). Several studies have recognized the importance of irrigation technologies in the process of agricultural development (Hayami and Ruttan, 1971;
Kulshreshtha, 1989). The economic literature on irrigation technology
diffusion has generally provided information on diffusion of one or at most
two technologies (Fishelson and Rymon, 1989; Casterline, Dinar and Zitberman, 1989). Less attention has been devoted to the abandonment phase
of the technologies. This is probably due to lack of information on use of
various technologies over time.
The purpose of this paper is to extend the existing literature by depicting
and estimating the diffusion-abandonment processes of several irrigation
technologies. The next section provides a conceptual framework for the
analysis which includes both the procedure for estimating technology cycles
and the framework for estimating diffusion-abandonment and diffusion
curves for several technologies. This framework is applied to survey data
from citrus groves in Israel. As compared to previous studies, this data base
addresses seven irrigation technologies. The estimates for the diffusion
curves are used to demonstrate and estimate policy effects on the diffusion
of irrigation technologies.
CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

The introduction of any technology can be described as composed of two
phases: in the first phase, the technology is introduced to an increased
number of users (or any measure of use, such as number of acres). This
phase is generally defined in the literature as the diffusion of the technology. The second phase is characterized by declining use of that technology.
The economic literature has concentrated mainly on estimating diffusion
curves for technologies (e.g., Griliches, 1960; Jarvis, 1981). However, it is
also important for policy makers to know the rate and time at which a
technology will be abandoned. The analysis provided in this section distinguishes (using the terminology suggested earlier) between two groups of

IRRIGATION TECHNOLOGIES

317

technologies: (1) technologies that are in a process of abandonment or have
already been abandoned, and (2) technologies that are still in the diffusion
process.
For the first group of technologies, a procedure is suggested to estimate
the technology cycle and is applied to data for citrus groves. The technology cycle provides data used to estimate a quadratic expression of share of
users for a given technology over time (a diffusion-abandonment pattern),
which is applied to estimate the time of a complete discontinuance of that
technology. For the second group of technologies diffusion logistic curves
are estimated. Crop yield price, water price, and government subsidy for
irrigation equipment are used to explain diffusion rates.

A procedure for estimating technology cycles
The term 'innovation cycle' in agriculture was used by Kislev and
Shchori-Bachrach (1973). They estimated the effects of different profiles of
adopters on the diffusion rate and ceiling for agricultural use of plastic
sheeting, without, however, estimating the length of the innovation cycle.
Several studies (Coughenour, 1961; Bishop and Coughenour, 1964;
Deutschmann and Hevens, 1965) investigated the reasons for discontinuing
innovations, but no innovation cycle was estimated. Easingwood (1988)
estimated product lifespan patterns for new industrial products. His model
provides an estimate for the overall life of a given technology from the first
day of its appearance in the market until its final disappearance. Although
the concept of technology cycle was implicitly included in Easingwood
(1988), no use or estimate was provided.
Estimation of diffusion and abandonment processes for technologies
used in the distant past may face problems of reliable data since documentation on the number (or share) of users may not be complete for the entire
period. This may partially explain past difficulties in estimating technology
cycles. The current study is fortunate to have data that allows detection of
the diffusion-abandonment process. Several data points exist: (1) the number of users (or acres) and time (year) when the technology was first
introduced, (2) present information on use of the technology, and (3)
information is also available on the number of new adopters during the
diffusion phase only but not during the abandonment phase.
Diffusion and abandonment of a given technology in the absence of a
complete data set for the stage of abandonment can be described using the
concept of technology cycle that provides the rate at which technologies are
being replaced. A technology cycle is defined here as the time period
between the adoption of a particular technology by a decision maker and
its abandonment or replacement by another technology. This concept has

318

A. DINAR AND D. Y ARON

been used broadly in models of equipment replacement (e.g., Rifas, 1957,
p. 67) that suggest replacement patterns for equipment used by identical
producers. Therefore, the technology cycle hereafter presented is not a
behavioral model (such as the model in Kislev and Shchori-Bachrach,
1973), but rather, a procedure to fit a curve to incomplete time series data.
In doing so, one assumes that each technology is associated with a given
life span (cycle) that does not change over time or as a result of market
events. This is a simplifying assumption since technology cycles may be
influenced by competing technologies, and prices, although, there are
circumstances when this is not necessarily true (Dinar and Zilberman,
1991). Therefore, the estimates here can provide an upper bound to the
technology cycle.
Let t = t 0 , .•. , tT, ... , tT be the analyzed time period where t 0 and tT are
the first and last years with observed number of adopters, and t T is the last
year in the sample for which the actual number of users of a particular
technology is known (notice that tT ';:?; tT).
N 1T is the observed number of users of the technology at time tT, and n 1
is the number of new adopters in year t. The variable n 1 is defined as the
cumulative number of adopters in year t, assuming (at this stage) no
discontinuance or abandonment of that technology (pure accumulation).
Then:

(1)
This definition of n 1 accounts for the cumulative number of possible
users as it appears in the data set. Since the above expression does not take
into account the number of growers abandoning the technology, the value
for n 1 at year t is not in agreement with the observed value for users of the
technology in year t, and therefore:

(2)
and

(3)
The variable Nt is the estimated number of users of the technology at
year t that is implicitly expressed as:

(4)
where z is the technology cycle (years).

As a first step, technology cycles are estimated for each irrigation

done using a simulation program (simulated values for drag-line are presented in Fig. 2) and a reasonable range of initial values for z. The chosen
value (z *) is the one that meets the criteria of equation (7).

To demonstrate the use of the technology cycle for creating the data
needed to estimate a diffusion-abandonment curve for a given technology,
assume for example, data for a 7-year period, and a cycle of 4 years. The
number of new adopters each year is 5, 7, 4, 3, 4, 3, 0, over the period of
the 7 years. The actual number of users will therefore be 5, 12, 16, 19, 18
(19 + 4- 5), 14 (18 + 3 - 7), 11 (14 + 0- 3). Notice that for the first 4 .
years, the technology was in a phase of diffusion and then for 3 years it is in
an abandonment process.

Diffusion-abandonment curves for irrigation technologies that have been
abandoned
For technologies in the abandonment phase, a diffusion curve is developed using the initial number of adopters and the estimated technology
cycle, z *. The observed pattern for these technologies displays a quadratic
curve over time (Fig. 2). The quadratic functional form to be estimated for
that process is:

(8)
In this expression N 1 is the cumulative share of adopters by year t. The
index t was normalized by setting the first year of the diffusion at 1. b 1, b 2 ,
and b 3 are the estimated coefficients. First-order conditions with respect to
t provide the estimate for the year (t*) in which the ceiling was reached:

(9)
Substituting t * into the quadratic diffusion curve (8) yields the estimated ceiling, Nt *. For t > t * the diffusion process is negative, meaning
that the technology is being abandoned. For technologies that are still in a

IRRIGATION TECHNOLOGIES

321

process of abandonment, the year of complete abandonment can be estimated by solving equation (8) with the estimated values for the b/s, and
setting N 1 to be zero.
Effect of input and output prices on th£! diffusion of modern irrigation
technologies

A number of studies have recognized that diffusion of a technology
could be affected by the product price and the profitability expected to
result from the technology. Griliches (1960) showed that the rate at which
growers accept a new agricultural technology depends, among other things,
on the magnitude of the profit to be realized from the changeover.
Mansfield (1963) showed that diffusion rates of new technologies in several
industries were positively related to the profitability of those technologies.
Jarvis (1981) showed that both the rate and the extent of diffusion for new
technologies were positively related to the profitability of those technologies. Using a normative model, Dinar and Letey (1989) demonstrated the
positive combined effects of charges for irrigation water and capital subsidies for irrigation technologies on the economics of technology selection
under various limiting environmental conditions. Theoretical and empirical
evidence cited in Feder, Just and Zilberman (1985) and in Thirtle and
Ruttan (1987), provides the basis to develop an empirical model to estimate
effects of output prices and input costs on the diffusion of technologies.
Long-term investment decisions such as in irrigation equipment are based
on past and future price expectations for inputs and output. For the
purpose of our analysis assume that only past prices of input and output (in
year t - t) affect the decision to invest in irrigation equipment.
This section demonstrates the use of economic variables to estimate
diffusion curves. These variables represent crop yield price, water price,
and subsidies provided by the government for the investment in irrigation
technologies. (The model is applied to technologies that are still in the
diffusion phase.)
The basic logistic equation for the diffusion process is:
(10)

where d 3 , which is the rate of diffusion, is assumed to be a function of crop
profitability, water price, and the subsidy for the investment in the technology (capital cost). By expressing d 3 as a linear function of these variables
(d 3 = 1/Jo + I/J 3 P1_t + I/J 4 P1"!.t + !f;5 S1_t), the basic logistic equation becomes
(Jarvis, 1981):

(11)

322

where P1 _ 1 is a variable measuring crop profitability, P1"'!1 is water price,
and S 1 _ 1 is a variable measuring subsidy level for the capital cost of the
technology in year t-t.
DATA AND EMPIRICAL SPECIFICATIONS

The models presented earlier were applied to data from a study of citrus
groves in Israel. The study sample includes only groves which are owneroperated, and are greater than 2.5 ha (1 ha = 2.5 acres or 10 dunams).
Excluded are groves operated either by cultivation companies on the basis
of fixed payment, or by part-time operators 1• These kinds of operators
were observed to be motivated by economic considerations extremely
different than full time owner operators (e.g., Guttman and Haruvi, 1986;
Feder et al., 1988). A total of 209 groves owned by kibbutz (collective
settlement), moshav (cooperative settlement), and private owners were
sampled. These groves are from settlements in six regions (from north to
south: Hadera, Ra'anana, Rehovot, Lackish, Negev and Gaza). The sampled area accounts for 16% of the total citrus area in Israel (Table 1).
Questionnaires were completed during the course of interviews conducted
with growers between October 1986 and April 1987. General information
on sample size and current distribution of irrigation technologies by regions
is presented in Table 1.
Irrigation technologies in common use during the study period were (in
order of their introduction to the market): (1) traditional irrigation such as
border and furrow, (2) hand-moved sprinklers (aluminum pipes), (3) solid
set sprinkers above canopy (hereafter referred to as 'above-canopy'), (4)
drag-line sprinklers under canopy (plastic pipes), (5) solid-set sprinklers
under canopy (plastic pipes), (6) low volume micro-sprinklers and micro-jets,
and (7) drip irrigation. The first four irrigation technologies have been
abandoned by farmers in most of the regions. The later three technologies
are still in a process of diffusion in most of the regions. These three
technologies will be identified hereafter as 'the modern technologies'.
Additional information with regard to the data, as well as detailed technology characteristics and associated costs, can be found in Dinar and Yaron
(1988). Information regarding number of groves, and adoption periods for
various technologies by region is presented in Table 2.
It should be noted that the estimated share of these groves was 40% of the total area, but
their share in production was less than 15% due to bad maintenance. Also, many of these
groves went out of production atfer 1987 (N. Ravid, Head, Ext. Serv. Dep. Citrus, Hakiria
Tel-Aviv, personal communication, 1990).

system, consisting of aluminum pipes, was labor-tensive and allowed very
little flexibility with regard to irrigation schedule.
Drag-line systems which were first introduced in the early sixties have
been in use for the longest period of time, although this technology is
labor-intensive and very difficult to control. The introduction of solid set
sprinkelrs both above and under the canopy saved labor and contributed to
better control of water application to individual trees. Both of these
technologies however, are capital intensive and labor extensive in comparison to the traditional furrow irrigation. Other disadvantages associated
with the solid set technologies involve operational difficulties, irrigation
water uniformity, and salinity problems (in the case of above-canopy).
Micro-jet and micro-sprinker systems (hereafter referred to as microsprinklers) introduced in the seventies are capital intensive, but require
only low water pressure, save labor, provide better irrigation water uniformity, and are easy to control. Drip irrigation systems demonstrate the
same advantages as micro-sprinkers, and are also less capital intensive than
micro-sprinklers.
For the purpose of estimating the effect of economic variables on
diffusion, three variables were used. The first variable is the export price
(P1 _ 1 ) for the shamuti variety of citrus ($ per 10 kg), on the assumption
that shamuti prices represent other citrus variety prices. (Shamuti is also
the main crop in the data base.) The information for constructing this
variable was collected from data recorded in the Statistical Abstract of
Israel (various years) with values represented in 1984 constant dollars. The
second explanatory variable is water price ( P1"!_), calculated in $ jm 3
(1233.5 m 3 = 1 acre-foot) from the Statistical Abstract of Israel (various
years) assuming the same price for all regions. This assumption is quite
reasonable under conditions prevailing in Israel since water prices are
dictated by a central authority which does not discriminate among regions.
The third variable is the subsidy rate (S 1 _ 1 ) on government loans for
irrigation equipment (Israel Ministry of Agriculture, various years). These
rates may differ by technologies, but it is assumed that no difference exists
between regions. This assumption holds for the regions included in the
data base, but not necessarily for other regions which may receive preferred subsidy rates.
For the purpose of estimating the diffusion logistic curves for solid set,
micro-sprinklers, and drip, no distinction is made among regions and all
209 observations are grouped in one data set.
RESULTS

Data on the current shares of the different irrigation technologies in
various regions are presented in Table 1. In 1987, more than 50% of the

325

IRRIGATION TECHNOLOGIES

grove area (groves and growers may be used hereafter in the same context)
was equipped with modern irrigation technologies. The diffusion processes
of these technologies began in the ealry sixties to the early seventies
depending on the region and the irrigation technology (Table 2). Handmoved sprinklers were adopted in the fifties in five regions, but by 1987 this
system was no longer in use (except for less than 1% of the area in
Hadera). Above-canopy sprinklers were adopted in the three northern
regions (Rehovot, Ra'anana, and Hadera), but are found today in only
2.3% and 7.9% of grove area in Ra'anana and Hadera regions, respectively. Drag-line sprinklers were adopted by growers in five regions but are
used today on only 32% of the citrus groves in Negev, 40.5% in Lackish,
21.4% in Rehovot, 23.8% in Ra'anana, and 8.3% in Hadera.
For each irrigation technology with declining use over time, data are
available on the number of groves currently practicing that technology (as
of 1987), and annual number of adopters from as early as 1901 to 1987. The
missing piece of information relates to the number of growers abandoning
the technology each year. The procedure developed to estimate the technology cycle was applied to the data on furrow, hand-moved, above-canopy,
drag-line, solid-set, and micro-sprinklers for each region separately. (The
technology cycle can not be applied to technologies still in a diffusion
process using the approach developed here.) Results for the technology
cycle estimates are presented in Table 3. The estimated technology cycle
for furrow irrigation is 26-30 years; the cycle for hand-moved sprinklers is
22-24 years, for above-canopy sprinklers it is 26-28 years; for drag-line
sprinklers it is 17-20 years; for solid-set sprinklers it is 17 years (only in the
Negev); and for micro-sprinklers the cycle is 15-17 years (only for Negev
and Hadera Regions). In general, the Negev and Lackish regions exhibit
shorter technology cycles for all irrigation technologies than the other

regions. However, these differences were not found to be statistically
significant.
The number of farmers using a particular irrigation technology being
renounced, was calculated for each region using the technology cycle. Then
quadratic logistic equations were estimated using a non-linear, iterative,
least squares procedure (SAS, 1985). Since there is a tremendous volume of
information, only results for Rehovot and Hadera regions are presented in
Table 4. A curve depicting the estimated diffusion and abandonment of
drag-line sprinklers in Hadera region is presented in Fig. 2. Results for all
regions and technologies can be found in Dinar and Yaron (1988).
The coefficients presented in Table 4 (and additional coefficients that
are not presented) were used to estimate the year when the diffusion
process reached its ceiling for different technologies. Application of the
procedure (equation 9) to the drag-line sprinkler equation (Table 4),
indicates that the ceiling was reached 15-19 years after the beginning of
the diffusion process (depending on the region). For technologies being
renounced (but not yet abandoned), the coefficients in Table 4 also make it
possible to estimate, the year when a technology will be fully abandoned.

For the drag-line sprinklers that were still in use on small portions of
groves in the various regions, it is estimated (not presented) that this
technology will disappear 30-35 years after initial adoption. Specifically, it
is estimated that during the year 1990, drag-line systems will no longer be
used in the Negev, lackish, and Hadera regions; and in 1995 they will also
disappear from Rehovot and Ra'anana regions. Similar estimates exist for
other technologies and are available upon request.
The three 'modern technologies' - solid-set sprinklers, micro-sprinklers
and drip systems - are used in all regions (except for Gaza where drip was
not used). Therefore, aggregated logistic diffusion curves were estimated
for the sample data. A range of lag periods from 1 year to 5 years was used
in the analysis (not presented), however, a lag of one year provided the
most reasonable results. A one-year lag is therefore used here, assuming
that a decision regarding the installation of a technology in year t depends
upon conditions existing in year t - 1. Some difficulties were encountered
in estimating these logistic curves. In all cases the Durbin-Watson (D.W.)
statistic is in the intermediate range, indicating inconclusive results with
regard to positive serial correlation. Draper and Smith (1981) suggest such
cases be treated as if a serial correlation had been found. Because of these
difficulties, the coefficients are not presented. In order to correct for the
possible presence of first order serial correlation, the Hildreth-Lu procedure (Pyndick and Rubinfeld, 1981) was applied. The corrected logistic
expression is now:

where
N 1 = N 1 - yN1 _

Pt-1 = Pt-1- yPt-2
Pt"'!_I =Pt"'!_l- yPt"'!_2

and
st-1 = st-1- ySt-2

and y is a scalar of grid values (0 ~ y ~ 1).
Equation (12) was estimated for a range of y values using the same
procedure as equation (10). The chosen value for y is that given by the
smallest sum of squared residual for the regression runs. The chosen values
of y are presented in Table 5 for each technology; an autoregressive
transformation was performed and the results of the regression runs are
also presented. Values for the D.W. statistic are now higher than in the

original regression, indicating that no serial correlation exists in the transformed estimated residual.
In all cases the estimated ceiling (d{) is higher than the actual share of
adopters in 1987, indicating that the diffusion process will reach its ceiling
after that year. All coefficients affecting the diffusion process behave as
reported in the literature: an increase in shamuti export price, in water
price, and in subsidy rate for modern irrigation equipment, will increase
the share of the modern technologies used in citrus groves. These findings
are in agreement also with results provided by Caswell and Zilberman,
1985). The speed at which the ceiling will be reached can also be influenced by those variables. For example (not presented in the tables), if
export prices remain at 1987 level while holding all other variables constant, ceiling will be reached in the years 1999, 2000, and 2001 for solid-set,
micro-sprinklers, and drip, respectively. If export prices increase by 10%
ceiling will be reached one year earlier than in the previous case for all
technologies. A decrease of the same rate in export price will result in a
one-year delay in approaching the ceiling for all technologies.

Fig. 3. Effect of subsidy for irrigation equipment on the diffusion of drip (national data).

There are some tradeoffs between greater use of modern technologies,
or shorter adoption periods, and social cost. For example, in case of
externalities in the production process related to irrigation, a regional
authority might be interested in transition to more efficient irrigation
technologies. This change is associated with additional investment that
might be subsidized by society through tax dollars, and should therefore be
evaluated in this regard. The effect of changes in subsidy rates for irrigation equipment on diffusion of drip is demonstrated in Fig. 3. A subsidy

rate for irrigation equipment of 20% would result in reaching the ceiling
four years earlier (1997 instead of 2001) than with a subsidy rate of 15%,
where as with a subsidy rate of 25%, the diffusion reaches ceiling in 1994.
The time gained by the increased subsidy can be weighted against possible
losses resulting from continued use of the existing irrigation technology.
Another demonstration of the usefulness of the results is presented in
Fig. 4. Here two policy variables are substituted in order to achieve the
ceiling of the diffusion process for drip irrigation at year 2000: water price
and subsidy rate, both of which can be controlled by the government and
used for policy purposes. By drawing a substitution curve between these
two policy variables (using the estimated equation for drip irrigation in
Table 5), it was found that the substitution rate is larger in cases where
water prices are high (substitution rate of 0.1) than in cases of low water
prices (substitution rate of 0.05). These findings can, therefore, serve the
policy maker to optimize the combination between these two variables.
CONCLUSIONS

In this study adoption and abandoment processes of irrigation technologies in citrus groves were estimated and depicted. Data from Israel and
Gaza were used to: (1) estimate technology cycles for different irrigation
technologies, (2) estimate, using the technology cycle, the process of
diffusion-abandonment of technologies already in the process of renouncement, and (3) confirm hypotheses established in previous theoretical and
empirical studies with regard to the effects of input and output prices on
the diffusion processes of irrigation technologies still in the diffusion phase.
It was found that the technology cycle length for a given technology is
dependent only on the technology and not on physical conditions prevailing
in different regions (e.g., weather, soil types etc.). For technologies being
abandoned, the technology cycle was used to estimate the year of discontinuance. These findings can serve policy makers of developing agricultural
regions, as well as manufacturers of irrigation equipment who are interested in predicting years of use for a given technology.
In many cases, policy makers must consider the effects of possible
policies on the behavior of growers in order to achieve changes in resources
use. For example, in the United States, the new 1990 Farm Bill considers
policies to improve water conservation and reduce pollution problems. In
Asia, as irrigation water becomes the binding constraint for rice production, improvements in irrigation efficiencies will need to be found. Studies
suggest, among other means, that farmers should improve their irrigation
performances by transition to modern irrigation practices. The current
study, although based on data from one region, provides insights that can

be used elsewhere. Effects of input and output prices on diffusion of
modern irrigation technologies were estimated and used to demonstrate
the effectiveness of possible combinations of policy variable levels on
achieving a range of technology diffusion rates. These variables were found
to be very effective in determining rate and ceiling of the diffusion process.
