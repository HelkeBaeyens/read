Abstract

At the 1996 World Food Summit, 186 countries made a commitment to reduce the number of chronically undernourished
people by half by 2015. In order to formulate effective policies for reaching this goal, a thorough understanding of the location
and causes of food insecurity is needed. This paper provides a broad overview of the current character of food insecurity in
developing countries, focusing on two questions: (1) Why are they food insecure? and (2) Why are the food insecure? To
answer the latter question data from 58 developing countries with high prevalences of food insecurity are employed to
examine the relative importance of two of food insecurity's most basic causes: national food availability and the inability of
people to access food due to poverty. Using child malnutrition as a proxy (along with descriptive controls for non-food
determinants of malnutrition), the paper finds little correlation between national food availabilities and food insecurity. The
group of countries that exhibit the highest severity of food insecurity are those with high poverty and food (dietary energy)
surpluses, consistent with the view that poverty is the most widespread cause of food insecurity in the 1990s. The paper
concludes by considering the implications of the analysis for appropriate geographical and policy targeting to improve food
security for the greatest numbers of people at the fastest pace, now and into the 21st century.© 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All

1. Introduction
Global 1 food supply is currently sufficient to meet
the food needs of the world's population. It is expected
to continue to be sufficient well into the next century
(Islam, 1995). Despite such abundance of food, over

840 million people (20%) in the developing world
today are estimated to suffer from chronic undernourishment (FAO, 1996a); many more suffer from deficiencies of protein and essential micronutrients, such
as iodine, Vitamin A and iron. Moreover, even those
who consume sufficient food to meet their dietary
needs can suffer from malnutrition due to poor health
and inadequate or inappropriate caring behaviors.
The most vulnerable of the world's citizens are the
first to suffer from such food and nutrition insecurity:
167 million developing-country children under age
five, or about one in three, are malnourished. It is

estimated that over 50% of child deaths in developing
countries are related to malnutrition (Pelletier et al.,
1995). As so vividly portrayed by Haddad (1995), p.
93, malnutrition has far-reaching consequences for the
ability of those children who survive to contribute to
their countries' development as adults:
For nearly half of the children in the ... least
developed countries, being born is a shock from
which they will never recover. In these countries,
nearly all of which are in South Asia or subSaharan Africa, out of every 1000 children born
alive, 112 will die before their first birthday.
Another 48 will die before their fifth birthday.
Of the remaining 840, 300 will be significantly
underweignt. As school-aged children, they will
be less able to learn in school. As adults, they will
earn less income and accumulate less wealth.
Only the remaining 540 children will emerge
relatively unscathed.
In some countries and for some historical periods
the inadequate food consumption and malnutrition
that are partially responsible for such innocent suffering have been partly due to insufficient supplies of
food at a national level. Adequacy of global and
national food supplies was the main concern of the
first world global summit on food security, the World
Food Conference of 1974, which coincided with rising
grain prices worldwide (FAO, 1996c).
While food availability is still a problem for some
countries, the root cause of food insecurity in developing countries today is believed to be the inability of
people to gain access to food due to poverty (Foster,
1992; Von Braun et al., 1992; Alexandratos, 1995;
Serageldin, 1995; Maxwell, 1996a). The problems of
food access and poverty were, appropriately, a focal
point at the second world summit on food security, the
World Food Summit of 1996, at which 186 countries
adopted a Plan of Action with the following commitment2:
We will implement policies aimed at eradicating
poverty and inequality and improving physical
and economic access by all, at all times, to
sufficient, nutritionally adequate and safe food
and its effective utilization (FAO, 1996b, p. 13).

2 A full list of the World Food Summit commitments can be
found in the Appendix.

At the Summit, these countries set a goal of reducing the number of chronically undernourished people
by half by the year 2015 (FAO, l996b).
In order to formulate effective policies directed at
improving food security, a thorough understanding of
the location and causes of food insecurity is needed.
This paper provides a broad overview of the current
character of food insecurity in developing countries.
Focusing specifically on chronic, rather than transitory, food insecurity, the paper addresses two questions: Where are the food insecure? and Why are they
food insecure? We first lay out a conceptual framework for understanding the causes of food insecurity
and introduce the empirical measures employed in the
paper. We then give an overview of the geographic
distribution of food insecurity in the 1990s, broadly
consider its basic causes in the developing-country
regions, and discuss where it is likely to be located in
the early decades of the 21st century. Next we employ
data from 58 developing countries with high prevalences of food insecurity to examine the relative
importance of national food availability and poverty
in determining food insecurity in the 1990s. Finally,
we consider the implications of the analysis for appropriate geographical and policy targeting to improve
food and nutrition security for the greatest numbers of
people at the fastest pace, now and into the 21st-first
century.

2. The causes of food insecurity
A person is food secure when he or she has access at
all times to enough food for an active, healthy life.
Accordingly, people are food secure when their consumption of food is sufficient, secure (not vulnerable
to consumption shortfalls), and sustainable (Maxwell,
1996). The list of causes of food insecurity is long and
multifaceted: they range from political instability, war
and civil strife, macroeconomic imbalances and trade
dislocations to environmental degradation, poverty,
population growth, gender inequality, inadequate education, and poor health. All, however, can be related in
some fashion to two basic causes: insufficient national
food availability and insufficient access to food by
households and individuals. A broad conceptual framework for food security is given in Fig. 1, in which it
is seen to be part of an overall process linking global
and national food availability, households' and indi-

victuals' access to food, and individuals' nutrition
security. 3
Global and national food availability stand at the
most macro level of the food security 'equation'.
Global food availability is determined by total world
food production. In any given year, national food
availability is determined by a country's own food
production, its stocks of food, and its net imports of
food (imports minus exports), including food aid.
Still closer to food security is household and individual access to food which, in addition to national

food availability, is determined by a household's 'full'
income. Along with cash income, full income includes
the value of goods produced (such as food) and
services provided (such as child care) in households
that do not enter the market, as well as in-kind
transfers of goods and services. Access to food may
be gained through (1) production or gathering of food,
(2) purchase of food on the market with cash income,
and/or (3) receipts of in-kind transfers of food
(whether from other private citizens, national or foreign governments, or international institutions).
Within households, individual food access is influenced by intrahousehold food distribution decisions.
As shown in Fig. 1, a household's expenditures of full

202

income for achieving food security compete with
expenditures on other basic needs (e.g. health care,
housing, and basic education) as well as non-necessities. A household or individual unable to meet all
basic needs can be considered to be in absolute
poverty (Frankenberger, 1996).
Finally, at the most micro level of the food security
equation is nutrition security, without which food
security is not translated into an active, healthy life.
Nutrition security is defined as follows: 'An individual
is nutritionally secure when he or she has secure
access to a nutritionally adequate diet and the food
consumed is biologically utilized such that adequate
performance is maintained in growth, resisting or
recovering from disease, pregnancy, lactation, and
physical work' (Frankenberger et al., 1997a, b, 1).
In addition to food security, nutrition security has two
other determinants. The first is 'care', or 'the provision
in the household and the community of time, attention,
and support to meet the physical, mental and social
needs of the growing child and other household
members' (ICN, 1992, 1). Examples of important
child care behaviors are the timing and frequency
of breast-feeding, the degree of stimulation and interaction with parents, investments in disease prevention
and domestic hygiene, the use of health services and
regular growth monitoring. The second non-food
determinant of nutrition security is health. Poor health,
or illness, affects nutrition security by depressing
appetite, inhibiting the absorption of the nutrients in
food and consuming calories and other nutrients while
fighting off and recovering from illness, leaving less
energy and nutrients available for growth and weight
maintenance (Ramalingaswarni et al., 1996).

3. Indicators of food and nutrition security
In the remainder of the paper, to examine where the
food insecure are located and the basic causes of their
food insecurity, we rely on three indicators (reported
for 93 developing countries in Appendix Table A.1).
The first indicator, daily per capita dietary energy
balance (DEB), is a measure of national food availability. It gives the sufficiency of a country's dietary
energy supply (DES) for meeting the dietary energy
requirement (DER) of its population if such dietary
energy were distributed among people according to
their requirements. Countries with daily per capita

DESs that are greater than their daily per capita DER
are classified 'dietary energy surplus'; otherwise they
are classified 'dietary energy deficit'. National per
capita DESs are derived from the United Nations Food
and Agricultural Organization (FAO) food balance
sheets and population statistics. Food production
and trade (including food aid)4 data and information
on seed rates, wastage, stock changes, and types of
food use for each country are used to arrive at the totals
of each commodity available for human consumption
each year. Estimates of total energy availability for
human consumption are then derived by aggregating
the energy values (in kilocalories, or 'kcals'). The DER
for each country takes into account the country's
demographic composition (sex and age distribution)
and allowances for physical activity. The DERs
employed in this paper correspond to body mass
indexes (BMI) observed among healthy, active people. 5
The second indicator we employ is a measure of
income-based absolute poverty, a proxy for people's
ability to access food. 6 A country's absolute poverty
rate is defined as the proportion of people whose
income is less than one dollar per day. Such people
4 Note that since food aid is included in per capita DES figures,
the figures are not an indicator of national food self-reliance - or
the ability of countries to meet their food needs on their own - for
all the countries. In the absence of food aid, countries that are
classified as dietary energy surplus may fall into the dietary energy
deficit category (Ramakrishnan, 1997). In 1994-1995, the developing-country region with the highest percentage of its food supply
met through food aid was Latin America (6%), followed by subSaharan Africa (5.6%) (USDA, 1995).
5 The per capita DERs corresponding to BMis observed among
healthy, active people are termed 'average' (rather than 'minimum') per capita DERs (FAO, 1996a). For the developing-country
regions these are estimated to be (in kcals): sub-Saharan Africa
2100, near east and north Africa 2150, east and Southeast Asia
2220, South Asia 2110, and Latin America and the Caribbean 2200
(FAO, 1996a, Table 16).
6 Nationally representative data on direct measures of food
access, such as dietary intakes and food expenditures, are not
available for a large number of countries. To give a rough estimate
of the numbers of food insecure in each developing country, the
FAO uses per capita DES and estimates of the distribution of food
intake within countries to calculate the numbers of 'chronically
undernourished'. While the FAO measure gives a broad idea of the
prevalence and numbers of food insecure in the developing world,
because it is methodologically biased toward national food
availabilities, it cannot be employed for making accurate crosscountry comparisons and in undertaking analyses of the causes of
food insecurity (Smith, 1998).

are unlikely to be able to meet their food needs
sustainably. Where possible, the measure is based
on (1985) purchasing power parity (PPP) prices to
ensure international comparability. It includes the
imputed value of non-market goods (including production of food for own consumption, but excluding
the value of people's time) (World Bank, 1998).
The third indicator, child malnutrition, is a measure
of nutrition security. Specifically, we employ the
prevalence of underweight children under 5 years
measured anthropometrically by weight-for-age, a
summary measure capturing both short stature (stunting) and thinness (wasting) (Martorell and Mason,
1996). Child malnutrition is determined by health and
care as well as food security; all three determinants
may act independently and interact synergistically in
influencing child malnutrition (Haddad et al., 1998).
Nevertheless, it is considered a good proxy measure
for food insecurity (Maxwell and Frankenberger,
1992; Rogers, 1997). In the analysis below, in order
to isolate the influence of food insecurity on child
malnutrition from the influence of health, we employ
an indicator of the quality of countries' health environments. This is an index composed of the percentage
of each country's population with access to health
services, safe water and sanitation.

4. The geography of food insecurity in developing
countries
Employing child malnutrition, absolute pov~rty,
and dietary energy availability data, it is possible to

construct a broad geographic distribution of food
insecurity and to identify its basic causes in the
developing-country regions. South Asia and subSaharan Africa are the regions with the severest food
insecurity problems (see Table 1 and Figs. 2 and 3).
South Asia has by far the highest rate of child
malnutrition, at 50% of all children under five. It also
has the highest numbers of malnourished children (see
dashed line in Fig. 2). At 86 million, this is almost onehalf of the entire developing-country total, which
indicates a massive food and nutrition insecurity
problem. Although the region has a dietary energy
surplus of 270 kcals per capita per day, nearly one out
of every two South Asian people is estimated to be
living in absolute poverty. This suggests that South
Asia's food insecurity is associated mainly with a food

access, rather than food availability, problem. In addition to food insecurity, South Asian countries' high
child malnutrition prevalences are also caused by their
poor health environments (only 46% of the population
has access to health services, safe water, and sanitation) and inadequate care for women and children,
factors that are linked in turn to the very low social and
health status of South Asian women (Ramalingaswami et al., 1996; Osmani, 1997). Within the South
Asian region, the severest problems are in Bangladesh,
which has the highest child malnutrition rate in the
world (56%), India (53%) and Nepal (47%). India is
the country with the highest number of malnourished
children in the world, at 62 million, or 37% of the
developing-country total.
Sub-Saharan Africa's child malnutrition rate of
31% is much lower than South Asia's. Due to the
region's current low population density, the number of
malnourished children in sub-Saharan Africa is also
fairly low, at 31 million. Its poverty prevalence, however, is almost as high as South Asia's, suggesting
severe food access problems. In addition, it has a
major food availability problem, with a dietary energy
balance close to zero. Of the 26 developing countries
that are dietary energy deficit, 17 are in sub-Saharan
Africa. Contributing to child malnutrition is the
region's poor health environment (with only 42% of
the population having access to health services, safe
water, and sanitation). The countries in the region with
the highest child malnutrition rates are Ethiopia (48%)
and Niger (43%). Somalia has the worst food availability problem of all developing countries, with a
dietary energy deficit of 568 kcals per capita per day.
Although the other developing-country regions
have less severe food insecurity and much better

health environments than do South Asia and subSaharan Africa, 7 some countries within these regions
have major food insecurity problems. While the East
and Southeast Asia region has a fairly high dietary
energy surplus of 572 kcals per capita per day, it
maintains relatively high povetty (26%) and child
malnutrition rates (23%). It is the home of a large
number of malnourished children, 38 million, which is
nearly one-quarter of all developing-country malnourished children. Countries with particularly high child
malnutrition rates are Vietnam (45%), Myanmar
(43%) and Laos (40%).
The Near East and North Africa region has the
highest dietary energy surplus of the developing-country regions, at 840 kcals. It also has a low poverty
prevalence, at 4%, suggesting that food insecurity is
not a major problem. Nevertheless, the region's child
malnutrition rate is 15%, suggesting that nutrition
insecurity remains a problem due to poor health or
care. Within the region, Afghanistan has an extremely
high dietary energy deficit of 475 kcals and a 40%
child malnutrition rate.
The Latin America and Caribbean region has the
lowest child malnutrition rate of all the developingcountry regions. Although it has a high dietary energy
surplus (at 613 kcals), its poverty rate (24%) is almost
on par with that of East and Southeast Asia. This
suggests that the main problem underlying food and
nutrition insecurity in Latin American and Caribbean
countries is probably one of food access. Compared to
other countries in the region, Haiti and Guatemala, for
which over one-quarter of all children under five are
estimated to be malnourished, have the severest food
insecurity problems.
Some developing countries have relatively low
overall prevalences of food insecurity but nevertheless
contain large numbers of food insecure people, due
either to large populations or in-country regional differences that cancel each other out (Von Braun et al.,
1992). For example, Brazil and Mexico, with dietary
energy surpluses and child malnutrition rates of 6
and 14%, respectively, nevertheless contain pockets

7 The approximate percent of people having access to health
services, safe water, and sanitation in east Asia is 76. For the near
east and north Africa region the percentage is 78. For the Latin
American and Caribbean region the percentage is 80.

L.C. Smith eta/.! Agricultural Economics 22 (2000) 199-215

of extreme absolute poverty and food insecurity.
China has a dietary energy surplus and a child
malnutrition rate of 17%, which is low compared to
other developing countries. Yet it is the home of the
second largest number of developing-country malnourished children, at 18 million, or 11% of the total.
Across developing countries, the prevalence of food
insecurity is generally higher in rural areas than in
urban areas (Von Braun et al., 1992). An International
Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) study has
found that the prevalence of children's (preschoolers')
malnutrition is consistently lower in urban samples
compared to rural samples (see Appendix Table A.2).
In Peru, for example, only 6.4% of children living in
urban areas are malnourished, compared to 17.7% of
children living in rural areas (Rue! et al., 1998).
However, urban food insecurity and malnutrition will
become increasingly important problems in the future
as rates of urbanization increase and urban sanitation,
diet quality, and food safety problems grow (FAO,
1996d).
Of course future food insecurity is dependent on
what actions are taken now to avert it. Nevertheless,
current regional trends can give us some idea of where
food insecurity may be located in the early decades of
the 21st century. By most projections, both food and
nutrition insecurity are on the decline in developing
countries as a whole. Child malnutrition in Southeast
Asia is falling rapidly, at around one percentage point
per year. It is declining more slowly in South Asia (by
one-half a percentage point per year), where it is
expected to remain high relative to other regions well
into the 21st century. Without accelerated preventative
action, the region's poverty, poor health conditions,
and poor quality of care could persist for some time.
Despite a declining child malnutrition rate, the Latin
American region is also likely, without accelerated
action, to experience a persistence of absolute poverty,
and thus problems of food access, into the 21st century
(ACC/SCN, 1992; IFPRI, 1995).
The only region in which food insecurity is
expected to increase over the next 20 years is subSaharan Africa. Trends show that child malnutrition
has either increased or remained static for most countries. Absolute poverty is expected to rise; predictions
show the region will face continued food availability
problems and probably will be unable to import the
difference between its food needs and production

205

without increased investment (ACC/SCN, 1992;
IFPRI, 1995).

5. National food availability, poverty, and food
security
We have seen that inadequate food availability at a
national level and inadequate access to food due to
poverty are the two most basic causes of food insecurity. Although both are crucial factors, for policy
purposes it is important to know which is relatively
more important in determining food insecurity in each
developing country. In this section we give some
quantitative evidence on this issue for the developing
world as a whole using data from the early 1990s.
As noted in Fig. 1, enough food available in a
country to meet the food needs of all of its population
is a necessary - but not sufficient - condition for
food security. This point is made clear by the fact that
in many countries food supply is ample to meet the
needs of all people but food insecurity nevertheless
remains high. Using child malnutrition as a proxy for
food insecurity, Fig. 4 illustrates how the severity of
food insecurity changes across six groups of devel50 .--------------------------------. 100

percentage of child malnutrition is measured on the left-hand

oping countries differentiated by their food availability positions. The groups range from one containing
high dietary energy-deficit countries through one
made up of high dietary energy-surplus countries. 8
We find that the probability that a child will suffer
from malnutrition, rather than decreasing steadily with
increasing food availability, is likely to be higher in
countries with low dietary energy surpluses than in
those with high dietary energy deficits. Only for the
medium and high surplus groups do child malnutrition
rates show a declining trend with increased food
availability. Overall, the dietary energy-surplus countries have a lower incidence of child malnutrition
(30%) than the dietary energy-deficit countries
(37%). However, the difference is small. Fig. 4 suggests a weak relationship between national food availabilities and people's food security in developing
countries. 9
Fig. 4 also shows the numbers of malnourished
children for the same six groupings. It is apparent
that in any given year a larger number of malnourished
children may live in dietary energy-surplus countries
than in dietary energy-deficit countries. In fact, in
1995 approximately 131 million of the 167 million
children under five who were estimated to be malnourished (78%, or about three in four) lived in
countries with dietary energy surpluses. This suggests
that in the 1990s, for the large majority of food
insecure people, the underlying problem probably

differences across the groups are more likely to be driven by
variations in food security than by variations in health.

is not one of insufficient food availability in their
countries.
To examine the relative extent to which poverty and
national food availability are sources of food insecurity, we focus on a subset of 58 developing countries
with high degrees of food insecurity. This group
includes all countries with dietary energy deficits
and/or prevalences of child malnutrition of at least
15%. To differentiate them by their food availability
positions, the countries are first grouped into dietary
energy deficit and surplus groups. To differentiate
them by their poverty positions, within each of these
groups are embedded a 'high poverty' group and a
'low poverty' group. The criteria for falling into the
high poverty group are that the country has either a
poverty rate of 35% or higher and/or an estimated
1995 per capita gross national product (GNP) of less
than $1000. 10
Table 2 lists the countries in each group, giving a
snapshot of their food security situations. The columns
of the table represent the countries' food availability
positions. The rows represent their (absolute) poverty
positions. Each country's child malnutrition rate is
given in parentheses. In addition, at the bottom of each
quadrant is the total number of malnourished children
in the group. The highest number fall into the food
surplus/high poverty quadrant (75 million), mainly
due to the presence of India. Overall, as was the case
for the entire sample of 99 developing countries (see
Fig. 4), the majority of the malnourished children
living in these highly food-insecure countries (81%)
live in food-surplus countries. In addition, a majority
(83%) fall into the high poverty category.
To see how the severity of food insecurity differs
across the groups, Table 3 gives estimates of the
prevalences of child malnutrition for each. The prevalence is the greatest for the dietary energy-surplus/
high poverty group, at 49%. Consider the differences
in the child malnutrition rates across the dietary
energy-deficit and surplus groups. The incidence of
child malnutrition is slightly lower in the dietary
energy-surplus group than in the deficit group for

10 Where possible, all povetty rates and GNPs are based on PPPconverted international dollars (see Appendix Table 1). The
countries for whom 1995 estimated per capita GNPs alone classify
them as high poverty are those listed in Table 2 but for which
poverty rates are not given in Appendix Table A.l.

Notes and source: after each country name, the percentage of
children malnourished (Appendix Table A.l, column 1) is given in
parentheses. A country is dietary energy deficit if its per capita
dietary energy supply is insufficient to meet its average per capita
dietary energy requirement; otherwise it is dietary energy surplus.
Countries with either poverty prevalences of greater than 35% or
per capita GNPs less than $1000 (both measured in PPP-adjusted
dollars) are classified into the high poverty group; otherwise they
are in the low poverty group.

the low poverty group; for the high poverty group,
however, the incidence is higher in the dietary energysurplus group than in the deficit group by ten percentage points. 11
Next consider the differences in the prevalences of
child malnutrition across the high and low poverty
groups. The prevalence is greater in the high poverty
group than in the low poverty group across both
dietary energy-surplus and -deficit groups, consistent
with the widely held view that poverty is the most
widespread cause of food insecurity. The difference is
particularly pronounced within the dietary energysurplus group, with the prevalence in the high poverty
group being almost double that of the low poverty
group. 12 This difference may partially reflect large
differences in the groups' health environment. 13 Overall, the numbers suggest that for most countries with
high food and nutrition insecurity and for most people
who are food and nutrition insecure, the underlying
11 The health environment index of the surplus group is higher
than the deficit group (77 versus 57). The groups' child
malnutrition prevalence difference may also be due to this
difference. Note that when India is excluded from the high
poverty/surplus group the group's prevalence of child malnutrition
falls to 35%, a number which is still not much lower than that of
the high poverty/deficit group and 10 percentage-points higher than
the low poverty/surplus group.
12 A two-tailed test for the difference in the unweighted means of
the child malnutrition prevalences of the dietary energy-deficit
group (31%) and the dietary energy-surplus group (28%) reveals no
significant statistical difference (t=0.84). The difference between
the unweighted means of the high poverty group (32%) and the low
poverty group (26%) is statistically significant at the 5% level
(1=2.4).
13 The health environment index for the high poverty/surplus
group is 77; that for the low poverty/surplus group is 43.

cause is likely to be poverty rather than national food
availability.

6. Policy to improve food security
The causes of food insecurity are complex and
interrelated. A myriad of interventions could be useful
in reducing or eliminating it. The key policy goal,
however, is not simply to improve food security, but to
improve it in a sustainable fashion for the most people
at the fastest pace. To reach this goal, given financial
and institutional capabilities, policies should be targeted at the underlying causes that pose the most
limiting or 'binding' constraint to improve food security in each specific context.
The above analysis suggests that, in the 1990s,
poverty is the most binding constraint to improving
people's food security in developing countries. In
most settings, policies that improve people's access
to food by reducing poverty are likely to have the
greatest gain in food security improvements. A powerful means of reducing poverty is through equitable
economic growth. In order for growth to benefit poor
people as well as those better off, special efforts are
often needed to enable the poor to participate in the
growth process, such as efforts to enhance their access
to financial and productive resources, information and
training, and physical and market infrastructure. A
second and complementary means of reducing poverty
is investment in the human capital of the poor, mainly
their health and educational attainment. Developing
people's skills and capacities equips them to take
advantage of new opportunities placed before them
by economic growth (World Bank, 1991). A final
means of reducing poverty is investing in the social
capital of the poor. Social capital is the networks,
norms, and trust among members of communities that
enable them to coordinate and cooperate for their
members' mutual benefit (Moser, 1996). It is thus a
further means of enabling poor people to take advantage of economic opportunities and gain access to
services that enhance their human capital.
In addition to poverty, many countries still face
problems of national food availability (particularly
sub-Saharan African countries). Most countries also
face nutrition security problems linked to problems of
health and care (particularly South Asia and sub-

Saharan Africa). To make good the gains of food
security in terms of actual human physical well-being,
attention to these problems must continue as well.
How then do governments and international organizations committed to reducing food insecurity go
about choosing appropriate interventions? Choice of
priority interventions requires, above all, identification of the people who are food and/or nutrition
insecure and of the primary causes of their insecurity.
In this way, interventions that are appropriate for the
given context can be chosen to alleviate the constraints
posed by these causes (FAO, 1996d; Frankenberger,
1997). Because there are many factors that are necessary but not sufficient for bringing about food and
nutrition security, all possible causes - whether
related to problems of food availability, food access,
or the non-food determinants of nutrition security
(care and health) - must be considered simultaneously for an optimal choice and sequencing of
interventions. Beyond identification alone, priority
setting requires knowledge of the relative importance
of each cause in determining food and nutrition insecurity. Emphasis can then be placed first on those
causes that pose the most binding constraint.
In general, when more than one cause is being
addressed at a time, policy objectives should be linked
so that multiple causes can be tackled with single
interventions and synergies can be obtained from
multiple interventions (Frankenberger, 1997). In
countries where food production is the main income
source of the poor, policies that increase agricultural
productivity can, when appropriately formulated,
improve food access at the same time as they improve
food availability because they can raise incomes and,
in the long run, lower real food prices. Similarly,
productivity-enhancing plant breeding that enriches
staple foods with scarce micronutrients ameliorates
not only food availability problems but micronutrient
malnutrition as well (Bouis, 1996). An example of a
case where multiple interventions can have a synergistic effect is combining income generation (especially of women) with nutrition education (Von Braun
et al., 1993). Combining human capital development
and food assistance in low-potential agricultural areas
where high food insecurity exists with investments in
increased food production in adjacent high-potential
areas is another example. In this case, jobs that are
created in the high-potential areas through increased

L.C. Smith eta!. I Agricultural Economics 22 (2000) 199-215

productivity can be filled by people from the lowpotential areas, both food availability and food access
problems are addressed (Frankenberger, 1997).
With an eye both to solving immediate problems
and reaching long-term goals, choice of an optimal
mix of interventions should consider interventions that
have an impact in the long run as well as those having
an impact only in the short run (Von Braun et al.,
1992). The benefits of investments in agricultural
research, population stabilization, basic education,
and economy-wide economic growth may only accrue
after several years. Yet they can have powerful positive impacts on a large number of people's food and
nutrition security. To avert or respond to crisis situations, some interventions are needed to tackle immediate problems. Examples of interventions that have
their impact mainly in the short run are supplementary
feeding, food stamp and food rationing programs.
Sometimes it is possible to contribute to both shortand long-term goals simultaneously. For example,
programs to combine supplementary feeding with
nutrition education, as well as food-for-work with
investment in rural transport and health infrastructure,
can improve food and nutrition security both immediately and in the future.
In many cases there will likely be trade-offs in
reaching policy goals directed at different problems,
and an optimal balance between competing goals must
be achieved. For example, a focus on food availability
leads in the direction of investment in new technologies to increase food (or export crops) production in
high-potential areas. A focus on poverty reduction, on
the other hand, leads in the direction of investment in
programs to raise incomes of poor people who often'
live in resource-poor, low-potential areas where
obtaining large food surpluses may not be possible
(Maxwell, 1996b). Beyond cost considerations, the
optimal investment balance should ultimately depend
on the relative importance of food availability and
food access in determining food and nutrition insecurity in the particular context.
Finally, in formulating efficient food security policies targeted at the underlying causal problems, care
must be taken to account for possible negative side
effects so that new problems are not created. Actions
that focus on improving food availability and/or
access may have negative consequences for nutrition
security by affecting its non-food determinants. For

209

example, interventions that lead to increases in household members' time in income-generating activities
may lead to a decrease in the time they spend in child
care or health enhancement, slowing down improvements in children's nutrition that accompany increases
in food access (Smith, 1995). Macroeconomic and
trade policies that are designed to promote foodsecurity-enhancing economic growth may have harmful impacts on some people's food security. For example, reductions in food subsidies raise food costs for
net food consumers, reductions in public expenditures
on health services can lead to a deterioration in health
environments, and currency devaluations can reduce
the incomes of those relying on imported productive
inputs. Increased food production that takes place
through expansion onto marginal lands (or through
shorter fallow periods) causes soil degradation, compromising future food production and income. As a
final example, influxes of food aid, without precautions, can lead to dependence and production disincentives, undermining long-term food production and
poverty-reduction efforts. Such possible adverse consequences should be taken into account in policy
formulation and either averted or compensated for
through complementary interventions.

7. Conclusions
To improve food security for the greatest numbers
of people at the fastest pace, policies must be targeted,
first, on the regions, countries, and people who are
most food insecure. Second, they must be targeted on
alleviating the underlying problems causing food
insecurity. To ensure that food security results in
actual improvements in human physical well-being,
nutrition security must be improved as well. Thus, it is
not only food itself that is important in efforts to
improve people's food security, but also health and
care (especially of children), both of which are necessary for nutrition security.
Geographically, South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa
are the developing country regions with the most
severe food and nutrition insecurity. These regions,
as well as countries in other regions with dietary
energy deficits and high levels of poverty and malnutrition, should be the focus of international efforts to
improve food and nutrition security. Whereas poverty

L. C. Smith et al.l Agricultural Economics 22 (2000) 199-215

210

is the leading cause of food insecurity for most
developing countries, including those that are dietary
energy surplus, many countries also have problems
related to national food availability (especially subSaharan African countries) and to health and care
(especially South Asian and sub-Saharan African
countries) that must be resolved as well.
In general, policy combinations that improve food
and nutrition security for the greatest number of
people at the fastest pace have the following qualities.
First, they focus on the most binding constraint to their
improvement. Second, they are based on linked policy
objectives so that single interventions can be used to
solve multiple problems and synergistic impacts can
be obtained from multiple interventions. Third, they
contain, as needed, both long-run and short-run instruments. Fourth, they achieve an optimal balance
between competing policy goals. Finally, they avoid
or compensate for any possible negative side effects of
interventions.
Improving people's physical well-being through
improving their food and nutrition security will have

two beneficial effects that enhance the long-run sustainability of interventions. The first is to increase the
capacity of the poor to pull themselves out of poverty,
thus improving their access to food in a sustainable
manner. The second is to provide the human capital
basis for accelerated economic growth and national
development (Behrman, 1992; Martorell, 1996), in
turn enabling countries as a whole to obtain sufficient
food for their populations over time, whether through
domestic production or imports.

a Notes and sources (Table A.l): The superscript '"' means data are not available or (for poverty ) not necessary for the paper's analysis.
The superscript ,b, is explained in the following footnote.
b Prevalence of children under five underweight: A child is considered underweight when his or her weight falls below -2 -standard
deviations of the expected weight of healthy children of her or his age using National Center for Health Statistics/WHO norms. The majority
of the data are from WHO (1999) and are based on nationally-representative surveys. Among these some of the underweight rates are reported
for 0-3 year olds rather than 0-5. We have adjusted these downward using the average adjustment factor employed in ACC/SCN (1993). The
supersCJipt ,b, denotes these cases. The underweight rates with superscript .c, are 1990 predicted rates from (ACC/SCN, 1993) Table 2.6.
These are estimated using data from nationally representative surveys that took place from 1975 to 1991 using two multivariate regression
models: (1) a global model estimated with data from 100 surveys in 66 countries; and (2) a sub-Saharan Africa model using data from 20
surveys in 20 countries. The independent variables employed were per capita dietary energy supply, infant mortality rates, percent government
fiscal expenditures on health, education, and social security, education of females, and the under five child population. The global and subSaharan African models had (adjusted) R 2 s of 0.9 and 0.82, respectively. See ACC/SCN (1993) Chapter 2 for further explanation.
c Number of children under five underweight: Calculated from column (1) and data on the numbers of children under five found in United
Nations (1998).
d Health environment: This is an average of three indicators: the percentage of the population with access to health services, safe water, and
sanitation (each indicator is given equal weight). Note that data on all three indicators are not available for a small number of countries.
Source: UNDP (1993), Table 12.
e Prevalence of absolute poverty: Data are only given for countries defined to be 'highly food insecure' (see Table 2). The majority of the
data are from the World Bank (1998) Table 2.7. They are derived from nationally representative surveys. For Benin, Burundi, Gambia, Ghana,
Togo, Yemen, Bangladesh, Laos, Mongolia, Vietnam, and Malawi, nationally defined poverty lines were employed. For the rest, an
'international poverty line' of one dollar per day in 1985 international prices was employed. Most surveys included the imputed value of
income earned from non-market goods (including production of food for own consumption).
r Per capita dietary energy supply (daily): Source: FAO (1998).
g Per capita dietary energy balance (daily): Calculated as per capita DES (using the data in Table A. I, column 5) minus average per capita
dietary energy requirements. A negative national food energy deficit indicates that a country's DES is insufficient for meeting the requirements
of its population. A positive national food energy deficit indicates sufficiency. Regional requirements, which are used as proxies for national
requirements, are given in FAO (1996a) Table 16.

2. We will implement policies aimed at eradicating
poverty and inequality and improving physical
and economic access by all, at all times, to
sufficient, nutritionally adequate and safe food and
its effective utilization;
3. We will pursue participatory and sustainable food,
agriculture, fisheries, forestry, and rural development policies and practices in high- and lowpotential areas, which are essential to adequate
and reliable food supplies at the household,
national, regional, and global levels, and combat
pests, drought, and desertification, considering the
multifunctional character of agriculture;
4. We will strive to ensure that food, agricultural
trade, and overall trade policies are conducive to
fostering food security for all through a fair and
market-oriented world trade system;

213

5. We will endeavor to prevent and be prepared for
natural disasters and man-made emergencies and
to meet transitory and emergency food requirements in ways that encourage recovery, rehabilitation, development, and a capacity to satisfy future
needs;
6. We will promote optimal allocation and use of
public and private investments to foster human
resources, sustainable food, agriculture, fisheries
and forestry systems, and rural development in
high and low-potential areas;
7. We will implement, monitor, and follow up
this Plan of Action at all levels in cooperation
with the international community. Source: FAO
