Abstract
Despite the wider application of efficiency analysis in Indian agriculture, little has been done on the investigation of intra and
interecological variations, size differences and their interactions. However, ecological issues have paramount implications for the low-input
sustainable agricultural production. Furthermore, due to the various causes of efficiency, the age-old size-based debate on efficiency
differences is not yet resolved. The present study examines the level of technical efficiency across ecological zones and farm size groups in
paddy farms of the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu. The study showed that 90% of the variation in output among paddy (IR-20) farms
' in the state is due to differences in technical efficiency. Land, animal power and fertilisers have significant influence on the level of paddy
production. Varying from 0.59 to 0.97, the mean technical efficiency was found to be 0.83. The use of F-test in two-way analysis of
variance (ANOV A) and censored regression (Tobit model), with dummies for ecological zones, farm size groups and their interactions, has
shown that, at mean level, the level of technical efficiency among paddy farms of the state differs significantly across agro-ecological zones
and size groups as well. The study further indicated that small-sized paddy farms in zone II and medium-sized paddy farms in zone III are
represented by ecologically size-biased production techniques; thus achieving higher technical efficiency. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

1. Introduction

The measurement of efficiency (technical, allocative and economic) has remained an area of important research both in the developed and developing
countries. Especially in developing agricultural
economies, where resources are meagre and opportunities for developing and adopting better technologies are dwindling, (Ali and Chaudhry, 1990) efficiency measurement is very important because it is a
factor for productivity growth. Such studies help

benefit these economies by determining the extent to
which it is possible to raise productivity by improving the neglected source, i.e., efficiency, with the
existing resource base and the available technology.
Hence, by doing so, they could also help decide
whether to improve efficiency first or develop a new
technology in the short run.
Pertaining to the enduring view in literature that
farmers practising traditional agriculture are 'poor
but efficient', and the resulting emphasis on increased investments in generating new and more
productive techniques, several studies that investigated the relationship between farm size and output
in Indian agriculture have been conducted since the
late 1950s. Regional variations, together with

input-output relations and enterprises, have also been
taken into account since the 1960s. These include the
works of Saini (1969), Sahota (1968), Hopper (1965).
These studies were conducted to evaluate, recommend and formulate appropriate productive techniques that lead to improved resource-use efficiency.
However, as they represented the production process
of the sample farms on an input-output space (production function) with a given technology, they were
not able to separate causes of efficiency due the
biological nature of agricultural production from the
farm-specific differences in the use of the available
technology.
Later, despite the conceptual difficulties and analytical differences, efficiency measurements have
been attempted in Indian agriculture since the 1970s
(see for example, Huang and Bagi (1984), Kalirajan
(1981), Junankar (1980), Sidhu (1974), and Lau and
Yotopoulos (1971); in fact, the latter two measured
relative technical efficiency using shadow profit
function). With particular reference to rice farming,
the studies by Shanmugam and Palanisami (1993) in
Tamil Nadu, Datt and Joshi (1992) in Uttar Pradesh,
and Jayaram et al. (1987) in Karnataka are among
the prominent works. These studies, although framed
on deterministic or probabilistic estimates of the
frontier production function, reported a mean technical efficiency of 75%, 66% and 74% among paddy
farms in the respective states.
On the other hand, although we observe wider
applications of efficiency measures in paddy farms
of India, only very few of these studies have investigated the same across size groups and agro-ecological regions (zones) simultaneously. Besides, there is
no consensus among the available studies on the
age-old debate of efficiency differences in the smallvs. large-sized farms. The earlier notion was that,
under the traditional labour intensive technology,
output per hectare on large farms was lower mainly
because of higher cost of hired labour. Nevertheless,
with the progressive introduction of technology, new
production possibilities have been opened for large
farms (Singh, 1992). Therefore, with their better
capital position, as well as institutional, extension
and credit advantages, large farmers are able to
substitute manpower by labour-saving devices; thus,
they are more efficient than small farms. Available
evidence suggests that various factors cause differ-

ences in efficiency even among farms of similar size
and other factors of production. The debate will
further be heated when ecological (environmental)
issues are incorporated. This is an important issue of
the present time, because ecological issues are the
core elements of sustainable development. The present study, therefore, is an attempt partly aimed at
investigating technical efficiency in paddy farms
across ecological zones and farm size groups and
their interactions in the southern Indian state of
Tamil Nadu.

2. The study area and data
The state of Tamil Nadu is one of the major
rice-growing regions of India that is located in the
southeastern extremity of the Indian peninsula. With
basically a tropical climate of 18°C-43°C (minimum
and maximum daily temperatures), the state receives
an average of 925 mm annual rainfall distributed
over four major seasons: the Southwest monsoon
(Jun.-Dec.), Northeast monsoon (Oct.-Dec.), Winter (Jan.-Feb.) and Summer (Mar.-May). A predominantly red loam, lateral black and alluvial soils
suitable for cultivation of cereals and fibre crops
prevail in the state.
The state is divided into seven distinct agroclimatic zones; viz., the Western zone (Zone-1 in this
study), Southern zone (Zone-11), Northeastern zone
(Zone-ill) and the Cauvery Delta area (Zone-IV).
The remaining three zones include the Northwestern
(dry belt) zone, the high-rainfall coastal areas and the
hilly zone, which altogether account for relatively
less than 15% of the total area under rice in the state.
Due to their special features and the minimal area
under rice, the last three zones were not considered
in this study.
Data pertaining to crop cultivation in all agroclimatic zones of the state, collected from 60 clusters
taken on a proportionate random sampling basis, are
available for each year in the comprehensive scheme
for estimating the cost of cultivation for principal
crops (CCPC) in the Department of Agricultural
Economics, Tamil Nadu Agricultural University.
Data for the present study refer to 129 high-yielding
variety rice (IR-20) cultivators distributed over the
four zones during the major production season of

B. Tadesse, S. Krishnamoorthy j Agricultural Economics 16 (1997) 185-192

October-December (Northeast monsoon) for the year
1992/1993. Although rice is grown in two seasons,
a single production season was selected in order to
minimize the effect of seasonal variation on input
use and the yield. HYV rice (IR-20) was selected
due to its wider cultivation in the state during the
particular season. Further, the analysis was limited to
the first four zones in order to maintain homogeneity, by excluding zones with special features and
which are less suitable for rice cultivation.

3. The econometric model
Following the Aigner et al. (1977) and Meeusen
and Van den Broeck (1977) method of estimating a
stochastic frontier production function in which the
disturbance term (E) is composed of two parts, a
systematic (V) and one-sided (U) components, a
Cobb-Douglas production function of the following
form was specified:
lnlj = lnf3 0

+ I:i f3;lnXij + Ej

(1)

where lj =paddy output in Quintals, X 1j =land area
under paddy in ha, x2j = human labour used in
man-days, X 3 j = animal power used in bullock h,
X4 j = machine power used in tractor h, X 5 j =
fertilizer (NPK) used in kg, X 6 j = Seed used in kg,
X7j = expenses on irrigation water, pesticides and
chemicals in rupees (Rs), In = natural logarithm, and
the error term (E) is defined as
Ej =

~- ~

187

and the ratio of the two standard errors as used by
Jondrow et al. (1982),
,\=8uj8v

(4)

or

(5)
is defined as the total variation of output from the
frontier which can be attributed to technical efficiency (Battese and Corra, 1977). Hence, on the
assumption that ~ and ~ are independent, the parameters of the production frontier (Eq. (1)) were
estimated using maximum likelihood method by an
econometric software called LIMDEP. Further, given
a multiplicative production frontier for which CobbDouglas production function (Eq. (1)) was specified,
the farm-specific technical efficiency (TE) of the jtlt
farmer was estimated by using the expectation of ~
conditional on the random variable Ej as shown by
Battese and Coelli (1988). That is,
TEj = exp(- ~)

So that,

After obtaining farm-specific technical efficiency using Eq. (6), the farms were segregated into their
respective regions and different size groups, for
which the average technical efficiency was computed
and compared using F-test and censored regression
(Tobit) model.

j = 1, 2, ... n farms.

The systematic component ~· which captures
random variation in output due to factors outside the
control of the farmer, is assumed to be independently
and identically distributed as N (0, 8 2 v ), independent of ~ which measures the technical efficiency
relative to the stochastic frontier. Following most of
the empirical literature, Neff et al. (1993) and Dawson and Lingard (1989), ~ is assumed to have a
non-negative (one-sided) half-normal distribution
with IN (0, 8 2 u)l.
Now, let 8 2 u and 8 2 v be the variances of the
parameters one-sided (u) and systematic (v ). Therefore,

4. Results
Ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates of the
parameters which show the average performance of
the sample farms are presented in Table 1. With the
adjusted R 2 value of 0.96, the inputs used in the
model were able to explain 96% of the variation in
paddy production for the state. The coefficients of
land, labour, animal power and fertilizers were highly
significant, but animal power has an unexpected
sign. This is due to the fact that, in many of the
farms, own bullocks, for which the farmer pays no
hiring charge, are available. Hence, given the minimal opportunity cost of own bullocks, it is likely that
animal power could be overused. Similarly, the coef-

188

ficients of expenses on irrigation, pesticides and
chemicals, although not significant, was unexpected.
On the other hand, the estimates of the stochastic
frontier which shows the best practice performance,
i.e. efficient use of the available technology, is presented in Table 2. It is evident from the table that the
estimates of A(3.1748)and u (0.2411)arelargeand
significantly different from zero, indicating a good
fit and the correctness of the specified distributional
assumption. Moreover, the estimate of y, which is
the ratio of the variance of farm-specific technical
efficiency to the total variance of output, was 0.909.
This would mean that more than 90% of the variation in output among the farms is due to the differences in technical efficiency.
With an upward shift in the constant term 1 , the
coefficient of land, animal power and fertilizers remained significant in the Cobb-Douglas stochastic
frontier production function 2 , implying that farmers
could be advised to use more fertilizers and less
animal power than what they presently use to increase production.
In addition, given the prevalence of numerous
marginal and small farmers in the state, from the
highly significant coefficient of land, we could infer
that it is possible to increase rice production by
consolidating holdings through cooperative effort.
It was also observed that the farm-specific technical efficiency varied between 0.59 and 0.97 with a
mean of 0.83. Thus, in the short run, there is a scope
for increasing rice production by 17%, by adopting
the technology and the techniques used by the best
practice paddy farms.
The frequency distribution of the farm-specific
technical efficiency segregated into the four agroecological zones (Table 3) shows that 36.4%, 29.4%,
16.0% and 30.0% of farms in Zones I, II, III and IV,
respectively, were operating at a technical efficiency

of more than 90%. On the other hand, relatively
more farms (15.6%) in Zone III, Zone I (12.12%)
and Zone II (8.8%) were found to be the least
efficient. Although, in terms of the most efficient
farms, Zone IV rates second to Zone I, no farm was
found operating in the least technical efficiency range
(55-65%) as in the other three zones.
Overall, the average technical efficiency in the
four zones varied between 80.46% in Zone III to
85.90% in Zone IV. As a result, the null hypothesis

An upward shift in the constant term is specific to the COLS
estimation procedure. However, in the maximum likelihood estimation of the stochastic frontier, the same shift may occur,
although it is not a built-in nature of the model.

such as the translog production function was tried. However, it
gave low t-ratios for all inputs used and a highly significant

of no difference in the mean technical efficiency
across the four ecological zones, evaluated using a
two-way ANOVA, was rejected. As the data are
unbalanced, the two-way ANOVA was worked out
through general linear model (GLM), the value of
which is derived based on the sequential sum of
squares. The rejection of the null hypothesis would
mean that at mean level, there exists significant
(F6, 128 a= 0.10) variation in the technical efficiency
achieved by paddy farms across the four ecological
zones in the state.
Nonetheless, ANOVA presupposes normally distributed data. Although the data are originally normally distributed, estimated efficiency measures are
decidedly (in the present analysis) half-normally distributed. Hence, the use of ANOVA may involve
specification bias. Therefore, the technical efficiency
measures were regressed on dummies for ecological
zones, farm size and their interaction. These were

censored between 0 and 1 without a constant term
using Tobit regression.
The results were consistent with the ANOVA
table but depicted detailed outcomes. Accordingly,
with a log likelihood ratio of - 94.021 for the censored Tobit regression model, t values for individual
coefficients indicated that farms in Zone II and Zone
ill are less efficient than paddy farms in Zone IV
(Table 6). However, the average efficiency attained
by paddy farms in Zone I was not significantly
different from that of paddy farms in Zone IV.
Further comparison by using individual {3 coefficients of the dummy variables by t-test (Gujaratti,
1995) showed that paddy farms in Zone I operate at
higher efficiency levels than those in Zone II, and
the difference between efficiency of farms in Zones
II and ill was not significant.
We can therefore conclude that paddy farms in
Zones IV and I are more efficient than those located

in Zones II and III, respectively and consistently.
This would imply that, given the existing technology
for rice production in Tamil Nadu, further improvement in paddy productivity can be made by farms in
Zones II and III if extension packages are geared to
advising rice farms in these zones to use the practices of those in Zones IV and I.
A similar analysis was done by aggregating groups
of farms into small, medium and large based upon
the size of operational holdings 3 . This was done in
order to provide an insight into the age-old debate on
the small vs. large farm size efficiency differences
(variation), which has not been resolved yet. The
frequency distribution is provided in Table 4. It is
evident from the table that 37% of the most efficient
(91-97% technical efficiency) farms comprise those
that operate small farms. The same was only 26 and
13% in medium and large farms, respectively. On
the other hand, the largest proportion (14.3%) of the
least efficient farms were those that operated large
farms while the same was about 8 and 7% for smalland medium-sized farms.
On these bases, the two-way ANOV A, with a
calculated F ratio of 6.07 at 2.128 degrees of freedom gave strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference in the average technical
efficiency across small-, medium- and large-sized
farms (Table 5). The Tobit model's dummy coeffi-

3 Small farms are those operating less than 1.5 ha of land, while
medium-sized farms are those operating 1.5 ha to 4.00 ha of land.
Those operating more than 4.00 ha of land were considered
large-sized farms.

cients further revealed the existence of significant
differences in technical efficiency across the farm
size groups considered (Table 6). That is, paddy
farms on small- and medium-sized holdings operate
at a higher level of technical efficiency than largesized farms. This is likely because under conditions
where accessibility to institutional finance depends
on asset position, particularly land (Lahiri, 1993),
small farms will be forced to allocate their meagre

resources more effectively. In this regard, the studies
of Sekar et al. (1994), Bagi (1981) and Lau and
Yotopoulos (1971) in different parts of India depict
similar findings. Specially in the examination of the
relationship between farm size and economic efficiency, Bagi ( 1981) has shown that using more own
resources such as human labour, bullock power and
fertilisers per hectare of land, small farms attain
more output and better technical efficiency than large
farms.
However, this study has not considered ecological
effects as an important issue of the present time. To
this end, the size-ecological zone-interaction-effect
dummies, in the present analysis, revealed that
small-sized farms in Zone II and medium-sized farms
in Zone III are peculiar. That is, the dummy coefficients are significant (at p s 0.01 and p s 0.05)
implying small- and medium-sized paddy farms, in
these zones, are represented by ecologically size-biased production technologies (practices). This could
be taken as an advantage in the short run by the state
policy makers to increase rice production.
In a nutshell, we could infer that the variation in
the level of technical efficiency among paddy farms
in the state exists across agro-ecological regions and
the size of operational holdings as well. Identification of specific factors that led to such variations in
the farm-specific technical efficiency is of profound
relevance for formulating strategies necessary to narrow the prevailing gap and increase productivity.
With the given database, this was imponderable.
However, the resource use pattern of some of the
most efficient (above 90% technical efficiency) farms
were examined. It was found that the most efficient
farms employed 150.94 man-days of labour, 112.22
h of animal power and 11.04 tractor h, used 222.48
kg of fertilizers and 40 kg of seeds, and spent
Rs484.66 as payments on irrigation, pesticides and
chemicals for cultivating a hectare of land, which
produced 57.49 quintals of paddy.

production is more prominent. Farmers were overusing animal power in rice cultivation.
Overall, the mean technical efficiency of 83.3% is
achieved by paddy farms in the state showing the
scope for increasing paddy production by 17% with
the present technology (technique) itself. A significant variation was observed in the mean level of
technical efficiency among the four major rice growing zones of the state, and farmers operating on
small and medium sized farms achieved a higher
level of technical efficiency than those with large
holdings. The farm size-ecological zone interaction
effects also reveal that small- and medium-sized
paddy farms in Zones II and III, respectively, are
operating at a higher level of technical efficiency
than all other farms.
Consequently, paddy farmers, in general, could be
advised on the use of less animal power, and more
consolidated use of land. Besides strengthening extension services to enable farmers to follow the
resource use pattern and practices of the paddy farms
in Zones IV and I, special attention should be given
to improve the efficiency of paddy farms with large
holdings through the adoption of practices of smalland medium-sized farms, particularly in Zones II and
III. This could help increase rice production in the
state in the short run.
