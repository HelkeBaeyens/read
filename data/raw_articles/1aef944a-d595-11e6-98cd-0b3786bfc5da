Abstract
This paper presents case-study results and aggregate data to evaluate the impact of research in African agriculture. Of 32 case
studies, all but eight report annual returns over 20% and many are far higher, with most gains arising in the late 1980s and
1990s. Spurred by policy reforms and changing incentives, these innovations have led to sustained growth in aggregate cereal
crop yields since 1985. Africa's belated 'green revolution' is based on new varieties (often with early maturation for drought
escape), complemented by new management techniques (typically labor-intensive efforts to conserve soil moisture and build
soil fertility). © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
Total investment in African agricultural research
increased during the 1960s and 1970s, but has stagnated or declined since then (Pardey et al., 1997). Low
levels of support may be due to the failure of research
to generate visible gains. This paper shows that past
benefits of research in Africa were obscured by other
factors, and that recent changes have made the gains
from research much clearer.
Using aggregate data, we show that the continent's
decline in per-capita production occurred between

1973 and 1985, a period of exceptionally rapid population growth, frequent civil unrest, and heavy taxation
of agriculture, all of which severely reduced productivity. Without research, performance during this period might have been even worse than it was.
Using case studies, we show that by the late 1980s,
numerous techniques produced by research were
being adopted, and are now producing high levels
of social gain. These include new varieties, whose
principal feature is often early maturity for drought
escape, as well as new management techniques aimed
at moisture retention and soil fertility. This type of
technical change is very different from that which
produced the green revolution in Asia and Latin
America, where greater moisture availability made
short stature and fertilizer responsiveness the keys
to higher yield.

2. Aggregate evidence on agricultural
performance
0.9

Although the data are limited, Africa-wide conditions can perhaps best be described using FAO index
numbers for production, exports and imports, as
shown in Fig. 1. After a period of relatively good
performance in the 1960s, the FAO index of total
agricultural production per capita fell consistently
from 1971 to 1984, for a cumulative decline of
22% (from about 115 to 90). In the same period,
the volume of agricultural exports fell even more
sharply, for a cumulative decline of over 40% (from
about 120 to near 70). And the volume of agricultural
imports rose also, more than tripling over the period
(from around 40 to 130).
The onset of the decline in the 1972-1973 and the
beginning of recovery in 1985 can perhaps be linked to
climate change, particularly in the Sahel region where
rainfall was below long-term averages during this
entire period. But Africa as a whole appears to have
had normal weather (Nicholson et al., 1988; Le
Houerou et al., 1993), so sustained agricultural weakness during the long 1971-1984 period, and subsequent recovery must have been due to causes other
than climate.
Some clues as to the causes of agricultural stagnation are provided by focusing on cereal grains. In
Fig. 2, we show average cereal grain yields for all

Sub-Saharan Africa, West Africa, and the Sahel from
1960 to 1995, calculated from USDA data. The continent, region and subregion show somewhat different
year-to-year variation, but a strikingly similar 20-yr
period of yield stagnation from 1964 until their lowest
point in 1984. Most remarkably, after 1984, there is a
sustained improvement in yields through 1995 in all
three areas.
Total production, shown in index-number terms on
Fig. 3, is a result of both yields and area. Again,
USDA data show a break after 1984, which is most
dramatic for the Sahel. All three areas had significant
increases in total cereal grain production from 1960 to
1984, but growth accelerated sharply in the following
decade particularly in the Sahel.

plays a role, although sustained trends such as those
shown here are unlikely to be due to chance alone.
And it is important to note that aggregate growth could
occur even if yields for all crops and countries are
constant, if production were to shift towards higheryield crops and countries.
Several possible explanations could account for
Africa's apparent success in raising aggregate yields
over the past decade. Access to markets and improved
incentives after policy reforms is clearly important, as
is higher rainfall in some regions, reduced population
growth, and relative political stability. But Africa's
success in increasing average cereal yields also points
to an untold story of successful technology development and transfer, as farmers adopt increasingly productive seed varieties and production techniques.
Some of the intensification observed after 1984
involves pre-existing techniques that were used more
intensively after policy reform changed farmers'
incentives. But the mid-1980s also saw the widespread
release of new grain varieties and cultivation techniques developed by African researchers and their overseas partners. It was only in the 1970s that many
research programs began to focus on food crops or on
smallholders in marginal areas, and agricultural
research programs often take 10 or more years to bear
fruit. The exact duration of research and extension
effort varies widely by program, but across Africa and
in the Sahel, the fruits of the first post-Independence
research programs began to reach farmers only in the
mid-1980s.

3. Case studies of agricultural research impacts
To assess the contribution of research to Africa's
agricultural recovery and economic growth, it is helpful to proceed on a case-study basis, with impact
assessments of individual research programs. Since
1993, the authors have provided training and technical
assistance to colleagues in numerous national agricultural research services, and collaborated directly on a
number of studies across the continent.
In this paper, to present as large a sample of case
studies as possible, we provide rate-of-return estimates from other comparable studies alongside our
own research. This compilation updates previous surveys of research impacts in Africa (Oehmke and
Crawford, 1996), permitting comparison with results
for the world as a whole (Echeverria, 1990; Evenson
et al., 1979).
Estimates from 11 analyses done prior to 1993 are
summarized in Table 1, while Table 2 summarizes the
results of 21 case studies completed since then. Most
of these 32 studies were never published, as they were
written for and circulated among an audience of
specialists in a particular country. Perhaps the most
striking result of this compilation is that, of the 32
studies we found, only 8 report rates of return below
20%-and the costs of these relative failures would be
more than offset by the numerous cases of very high
returns.
The research programs addressed in these studies
may not be a random sample of research activity, but

they cover programs facing heavy criticism, as well as
those seen as successful, and include a broad crosssection of the major types of research programs. Our
compilation confirms that returns to research in Africa
are similar those found elsewhere, showing high payoffs for a wide range of programs. The contribution of
research to agricultural performance and economic
growth is not obvious, since it occurs gradually, and is
spread widely across the population, but the net
benefits are significantly larger than the funding provided.
A striking result from our compilation is that the
research failures are often-but not always-in the
most difficult agroecological regions. Several competing hypotheses could explain this result. The first and
perhaps dominant view is that payoffs tend to be lower
in lower-potential areas because the environment's
low reserves of soil and water limit any possible
production increases. A second and more nuanced
view would be that those productivity-enhancing

innovations, which are discovered in these regions,
are limited in their applicability, due to the diversity of
micro-environments found in low-rainfall areas. A
third explanation would involve the political-economy
problems of these areas, where weak governments are
often unable to provide key public goods. But all of
these hypotheses are contradicted by the sustained
yield increases observed for the Sahel in Figs. 2 and 3
above, which shows that sustained productivity
growth is possible even in that very harsh environment.
Perhaps the most compelling general explanation
for some programs' failure is simply that local institutions had not (yet) found the right mix of activities to
produce cost-effective technologies in those locations.
For example, on Table 1, the very low rate of return to
research in Niger found by Mazzucato and Ly (1992)
can be associated with that country's very weak seedmultiplication system, which effectively prevented the
widespread dissemination of new varieties. On

Table 2, the relatively low gains from a project to
promote stone dikes in Burkina Paso documented by
Ouedraogo and Illy (1996) can be associated with that
project's provision of credit to farmers for the purchase of rock phosphate to accompany the stone dikes,
which accounted for a significant portion of the project's costs, but may have contributed little to its
benefits. In these and other cases, detailed impact
assessments provide key lessons for the design of
future projects, but provide no evidence that research
itself is unproductive. Indeed, despite the late start and
occasional failures of Africa's foodcrop research programs, case studies provide ample evidence that highimpact innovations are now emerging in all of Africa's
agroclimatic zones.

Mrican research, like similar efforts elsewhere, does
yield great economic gains in terms of the level and
stability of farmers' income, and in terms of national
economic growth.

4. Conclusion: aggregate and case-study results
in comparative perspective

The aggregate and case-study evidence presented
here helps explain why productivity growth in Africa
has occurred later and less dramatically than the
'green revolution' in Asia and Latin America. Africa's
agricultural intensification in the late 1980s and 1990s
shares some features of the earlier changes in Asian
and Latin American agriculture, notably the increased
use of labor and purchased inputs to sustain higher
yields per hectare. But there are also major differences, and Africa's productivity growth is clearly less
visible in farmers' fields or off-farm markets. In
particular, much productivity growth in the green
revolution areas of Asia and Latin America was driven
by the adoption of short-stature fertilizer-responsive
crop varieties, in the context of relative moisture
abundance-and led to sharp rises in marketed surplus
of food grains (Falcon, 1970). In contrast, much of
Mrica's productivity growth has occurred through
early-maturing varieties aimed stabilizing yields in
short rainy seasons-and has occurred in food-deficit
environments, where marketed surplus consists of
livestock, oilseeds, cotton and other products (Sanders
et al., 1995). This contrast suggests that Africa's
productivity growth was delayed in part simply
because the relevant research occurred relatively late,
and has been hidden from view simply because the
relevant benefits are not easily observed. Nonetheless,
the work reported here demonstrates convincingly that
