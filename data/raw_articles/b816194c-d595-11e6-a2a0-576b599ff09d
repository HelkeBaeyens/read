Abstract
Both informal and formal loans matter in agriculture. However, formal lenders provide many more production loans than
informal lenders, often at a cost (mostly loan default cost) higher than what they can recover. For example, the Agricultural
Development Bank of Pakistan (ADBP), providing about 90% of formal loans in rural areas, incurs high loan default costs.
Yet, like other governments, the Government of Pakistan supports the formal scheme on the grounds that lending to agriculture
is a high risk activity because of covariate risk. Hence, such policies are often based on a market failure argument. As farm
credit schemes are subsidised, policy makers must know if these schemes are worth supporting. Using a recent large household
survey data from rural Pakistan (Rural Financial Market Studies or RFMS), we have attempted to estimate the effectiveness
of the ADBP as a credit delivery institution. A two-stage method that takes the endogeneity of borrowing into account is
used to estimate credit impact. Results reveal that ADBP contributes to household welfare and that its impact is higher for
smallholders than for large holders. Nevertheless, large holders receive the bulk of ADBP finance. The ADBP is, thus, not a
cost-effective institution in delivering rural finance. Its cost-effectiveness can be improved by reducing its loan default cost
and partially by targeting smallholders in agriculture where credit yields better results.

1. Introduction

Credit is important for development. It capitalises
farmers and entrepreneurs to undertake new investments or adopt new technologies. It helps smooth
consumption by providing working capital and reduces poverty in the process. Both formal and informal
lenders are active in rural credit market (Adams and

transactions are some of the attractive features of informal credit. 2 However, informal finance may not be as
conducive to development as formal finance because:
2 Although the nominal rate of interest is lower for formal loans
than for informal loans, the transaction costs of borrowing are
higher for formal loans than for informal loans. Some informal
lenders also perform an important role by facilitating the marketing
of products or purchasing of inputs, such as fertiliser. Additionally,
since informal loans are often given in kind and for specific
purposes, some client needs are served better by informal than by
formal loans.

(i) it is expensive; 3 (ii) it is short-term and largely
used for consumption; and (iii) it is not generally large
enough to spur investment and growth.
Notwithstanding the limitations of informal finance,
many governments have attempted in the past to develop alternative financial institutions to provide credit
to farmers and other rural producers. Many such attempts have failed not only in delivering credit to target households but also in promoting a viable credit
delivery system. High covariate risk of agricultural
production (Binswanger and Rosenzweig, 1986), the
asymmetric information, lack of enforcement of loan
contracts (Hoff and Stiglitz, 1990),4 government imprudent interference in credit markets, and rent-seeking
as a result of credit rationing (Braverman and Guasch,
1989) are some of the factors alleged to be responsible
for the poor performance of the government-directed
credit schemes in many countries.
With the dismal picture of state-owned rural finance
organisations, non-governmental micro-finance institutions have been growing to meet the credit needs of
small producers in many countries. Reports indicate
that they now meet the credit demand of 10-12 million people in Africa, Asia and Latin America. 5 Many
of these organisations are subsidised not for absorbing high loan default costs but for covering high transaction costs associated with group-based lending and
other social intermediation costs (Khandker, 1988). If
agricultural credit and other targeted schemes are to be
supported, policy makers must know how much they
are subsidised, who receives this subsidy, and whether
it helps the borrowers.
Assessing the net contribution of a program means
evaluating both its costs and benefits. Assessing the
costs of lending involves the imputed market cost of
the subsidy these schemes receive from the government and donors. Assessing benefits is often problematic because funds are fungible and it is not clear if
3 Some studies, however, question the excessive interest rates of
informal lenders (e.g. Hussain and Demaine, 1992).
4 To reduce the moral hazard problem and associated transaction costs of lending, financial institutions often ask for physical
collateral. Collateral restrictions exclude the poor who do not have
assets, such as land, to offer as collateral but are otherwise good
credit risks.
5 For a discussion of a broad range of programs, see Otero and
Rhyne (1994), Christen et al. (1994), Brugger and Rajpatirana
(1995), and Hulme and Mosley (1996).

the measured credit effect reflects the borrowing constraint or the unobservable characteristics of a borrower. The presence of bias caused by self-selection of
borrowers into credit programs may bias assessment
of benefits of these programs by as much as 100%. 6
Nonetheless, there are a number of studies that have
successfully estimated program benefits (Binswanger
and Khandker, 1995; Carter, 1988; Carter and Weihe,
1990; Feder et al., 1990; Pitt and Khandker, 1996,
1998). Binswanger and Khandker (1995) estimated the
impact of formal credit using district-level panel data
from India and found that formal credit increases rural income and productivity, and that benefits exceed
the cost of the formal system by at least 13%. Feder
et al. (1990) estimated a switching regression model
for households in China and distinguished between
households that are credit-constrained and those that
are not.
Pitt and Khandker (1998) examined the impact of
credit from the Grameen Bank and other two targeted credit programs in Bangladesh on a variety of
individual and household outcomes, including school
enrolment, labour supply, asset holding, fertility and
contraceptive use. They found credit to be a significant
determinant of many household outcomes, and
that program credit has a significant effect on
the well-being of poor households in Bangladesh.
Khandker (1988) observed that micro-credit programs
are as cost-effective as other programs, such as the
food for work, in benefiting the poor.
The objective of this paper is to analyse the role
of the Agricultural Development Bank of Pakistan
(ADBP) in rural areas and assess its cost-effectiveness
in delivering farm credit. The paper's contribution lies in adding to the existing literature on the
cost-effectiveness of a government-supported farm
credit program which has not been managed well
for years. The data used in this paper's analysis
are drawn from the Rural Financial Market Studies
(RFMS) of Pakistan. Results suggest that the effect
of ADBP finance is substantial, and that the impact
is higher for smallholders than for medium and large
holders in agriculture. But, given the distribution of
loans and loan recovery rates, ADBPs lending program is not cost-effective. The program can be made
cost-effective by supporting smallholders (who own

up to 2.5 acres of land) more than medium and large
holders, by improving both loan recovery and administrative efficiency, and by making operations liable
to a lending portfolio.?
The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 describes the survey and sample data used for the study.
Section 3 describes the rural credit market in Pakistan. A number of studies including recent data show
that the market share of institutional credit is low despite government intervention since 1960. Also, formal credit has failed to reach the borrowers who may
be able to use credit more productively. Section 4 explains the econometric model used to asses the credit
impacts on different household outcomes. Section 5
discusses the regression results. Based on two-stage
estimation techniques, formal credit is found to have
significant positive impacts on most household outcomes considered in this paper. Section 6 shows how
much social costs are involved for ADBP in providing credit. Section 7 presents the cost-benefit analysis
of the ADBP. The concluding section summarises the
findings and discusses policy options.

2. Data
Data from the RFMS, collected for the State Bank
of Pakistan with financial assistance from the World
Bank in 1996, are used. Household survey and informal lenders' survey data were collected by two
organisations: (1) the Applied Economic Research
Centre (AERC, 1998) of the University of Karachi
and (2) the Punjab Economic Research Institute
(PERI) in Lahore. The Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE) in Islamabad collected
the institutional data on the ADBP and commercial
banks working in the rural sector. Household survey
data were collected for all five provinces of Pakistan,
namely, north western frontier province (NWFP),
Sindh, Balochistan, Punjab and Pakistan controlled
Kashmir (AJ&K). A rural household survey was
conducted on the pattern of the LSMS surveys conducted by the World Bank to provide the data base.
7 By providing more loans to smallholders, transaction costs
may increase but loan default costs will decrease, because the loan
recovery rates are higher for smallholders than for large holders
in agriculture.

The survey covered various aspects of the household
economy, including demographic information, labour
supply, household expenditure, income sources, farm
production, borrowing practices, assets and liabilities.
A two-stage stratified sampling strategy was
adopted for selection of villages and households. In the
first stage, 250 villages were selected randomly from
a total of approximately 50,000 villages in Pakistan
(as reported in Agricultural Statistics, 1994-1995).
The allocation of villages within the provinces was
done in proportion to cultivated area. A completely
randomised sampling strategy was adopted for each
provincial sample. Villages were selected randomly
from the province after excluding very small and very
large villages, depending on the size distribution of
villages within each province.
In the second stage, household information from
each village was used to sample households on the
basis of landholding size and/or occupational distribution. A census of households was conducted in each of
the selected 250 villages to gather information on landholding size and occupational distribution. To sample
households within a village, a three-stage procedure
was adopted. First, the number of households selected
from a village was in proportion to the total household counts of villages. Second, the distribution of the
households drawn from a village was in proportion to
the distribution of landholding categories. Finally, the
households to be interviewed were drawn randomly
from the total number of households in each category
in each village. In all, the survey covered 6000 households from the 250 selected villages, for an average of
24 households per village. However, because of data
collection errors, we finally managed to use data on
4380 households from 217 villages in this paper. In order to reflect the actual distribution, we used sampling

Table 1.

Table 3
Distribution of loans by sources
Formal sources

Our data collection strategy was such that we collected consumption and other information for the last
reference agricultural year (1995/1996), while information collected on loans referred to the 5 years preceding the survey. Table 2 presents the distribution of
sample households (4380) by loan categories. A total
of 2581 households (that is, 59%) were reported to
borrow from any source over the 5 year period. A total of 180 households borrowed from formal sources.
Out of these households, 91 also borrowed from informal sources. Table 2 also shows the distribution of
borrowing status by province. As Punjab has by far
the largest population (55% of households sampled
were from Punjab), it is no wonder it has the highest
percentage of borrowing households (51%). Although
households borrowing from formal sources represent
only 7% of all borrowing households, formal sources
account for 21.9% of total loan volume, because the
average size of formal loans is much larger than that of
informal loans (Table 3). This means informal sources
still account for 78% of the loan volume in rural Pakistan. However, the share of formal credit has been
increasing gradually and consistently (PACC, 1973,
1985, 1995).
The data show that ADBP has been the dominant
source of formal credit, while 'friends and relatives'
is the largest source of informal credit. The ADBP

provides 86.5% of total institutional loans followed
by government sources (4.8%), NGOs (3.7%), commercial banks (3.2% ), and co-operatives (1.8%)
(Table 3). Friends and relatives, who do not usually
charge any interest, provide 57.2% of the informal
loan volume, while interest charging informal lenders
(such as arthi, 8 input suppliers, shopkeepers, commercial agents and others) provide the remaining
42.8% (Table 3). Of these 42.8%, landlords account
for 12.8% followed by shopkeepers (7%), arthi (6%),
input dealers (6% ), and a host of other suppliers (11%
together) (Table 3).
8 Arthi is an informal lender (similar to input suppliers), who
provides lending for an activity and in return gets repaid mostly
in kind in terms of output. For example, an arthi can lend money
for fertiliser purchase and the borrower can pay back in terms of
output crop.

Operational landholding = land owned+ land rented+ land sharecropped-in - land rented out - land left uncultivated. Household category
by operational holding has been defined as: landless (no land), subsistence (0 acre > land ::::: 5 acres), small (5 acres > land ::::: 12.5 acres),
medium (12.5 acres > land ::::: 25 acres), and large (land > 25 acres).

The data show that formal credit is meant largely
for production and investment, while informal credit
is mostly for consumption smoothing. As Table 4
shows, only 5.2% of formal loan volume, compared
with 55.5% of informal loan volume, went to meet
consumption and other personal needs. However,
informal loans are given mostly for shorter periods
(77.5% of them are for a duration of l year or less),
while formal loans are mostly long-term (76.7% are
for more than a year). More importantly, formal credit
goes overwhelmingly to support agricultural production (87.5%), while only 26.9% of informal loans
support agriculture. Past studies also have shown that
formal credit contributes significantly to agriculture
of rural Pakistan (Zuberi, 1989; Malik et al., 1991).
Zuberi (1989) finds that 70% of total formal credit is
used to purchase seed and fertiliser.
The issue now is to what extent formal credit matters to agriculture. Zuberi (1989) concludes that most
of the increases in agricultural output can be explained
by changes in the amount of seed and fertiliser expenditure. Malik et al. ( 1991) attempts to provide evidence
for the role of formal credit in agricultural produc-

tion. They use a two-stage structure in which the probability of taking a formal loan is predicted in the
first stage and the predicted value is used in the second stage to estimate the impact of fertiliser use per
acre. 9 Like Zuberi's study (1989), their results show
that formal credit is an important determinant of fertiliser and seed expenditure. The study of von Braun
et al. (1993) shows that farmers with access to credit
have 37% higher input expenditures than those without such access.
The impact of credit in agriculture, however, depends on who receives formal loans. Our survey data
shows that, households with large operational holding (more than 25 acres), who are about 4.1% of
all households, account for 41.6% of all households
borrowing exclusively from formal sources (Table 5).
In contrast, households with no operational holding,
9 Malik et a!. ( 1991) use variables such as household attitude
toward interest-bearing loan and village credit to measure the total
institutional credit obtained by the households in the village other
than the household in question. The latter instrument measures the
impact of infrastructure and other village variables on the demand
for credit.

202

S.R. Khandker, R.R. Faruqee/Agricultural Economics 28 (2003) 197-213

who constitute 34.2% of all rural households, account
for only 5.2% of the exclusive borrowers of formal
loans. A reverse scenario is found when it comes to
informal loans. Landless households comprise 24.6%
of the households that borrow exclusively from informal sources, whereas wealthiest households constitute only 9.4% of the households in the same
category.
The skewed distribution of formal credit may have
an impact on agricultural growth and rural poverty in
Pakistan. Since the productivity of small householders is higher than that of large holders according to
established development literature, the impact of formal credit is expected to be higher for smallholders
than for large holders. Since the large holders receive
the lion's share of formal credit, one can hypothesise that the skewed distribution of formal credit
has a restraining effect on rural growth and welfare.
This is indeed a concern, even when only one-third
of rural borrowing in volume comes from formal
sources.

4. Credit impact assessment: an econometric
framework
The purpose here is to estimate the impacts of formal/institutional credit on rural welfare. Since formal/institutional sector in Pakistan is dominated by
the ADBP, this amounts to estimating the impact of
ADBP loans on rural household welfare. What researchers observe is the amount of credit received from
ADBP that is based on both the demand for and the
supply of credit. The real difficulty is how to disentangle the demand from the supply. Often household
and area characteristics determine the household's demand for credit. But these same characteristics also
influence the supply of credit, giving rise to a problem of selection bias. It is possible that borrowers are
more productive not because of the loan, but because
they are more entrepreneurial, and hard-working. It
is also possible that borrowers are productive and,
hence, able to repay, not because they have better ability but because operate in a more productive environment.
Lenders such as the ADBP screen borrowers based
on their traits and environmental characteristics which
are not easily observed by researchers. Thus, the al-

location of ADBP credit is not random. 10 As funds
are fixed, the lenders would like to allocate funds
to the best possible borrowers and in the best possible agroclimate area. We used a competitors' model
framework for the decision making process of ADBP
lending.
Consider the quasi-reduced form of a welfare equation
(1)

The left-hand side variable, Yij, indicates the outcome
of interest such as the consumption of household i in
village j, Cij denotes household's receipt of ADBP
credit, X; denotes the observed household characteristics such as age, education and sex of head of the
household, fhj is an unmeasured determinant of Yij
that is fixed within a village, sij is a nonsystematic error reflecting, in part, unmeasured determinants of Yij
that vary over households such that E(sij [Xij, fhj) = 0,
and fJ y and 8 are unknown parameters. If all variables
are observable, 8 would determine the impact of the
credit without bias. However, since fhj is unobservable, if the receipt of the credit serves as an indicator
of these unobserved variables, this would result in biased estimates of ADBP credit in Eq. (1).
The standard approach to the way out of this
predicament is to use instrumental variables. So we
estimate the determinants of borrowing in a first stage
that includes the instrumental variables which do not
enter into the outcome Eq. (1), but are able to predict
the amount borrowed that does not depend on the
household/individual characteristics. We then insert
the predicted, rather than actual, amount in the second stage equation, which helps correct for selection
bias in the second stage. Consider estimating first the
following borrowing equation:
(2)

The left-hand side variable of (2) denotes borrowing
from the ADBP, Zij (instrumental variables) is a set of
household or village characteristics distinct from the
X's so that they affect only Cij but not other household behaviours (y;j) conditional on Cij; f3c, and JT
are unknown parameters, fh} is an unmeasured determinant of Cij that is fixed within a village, and sij is
10 See Pitt and Khandker (1996) for a discussion of selection
biases.

S.R. Khandker; R.R. Faruqee/Agricultural Economics 28 (2003) 197-213

a nonsystematic error that reflects unmeasured determinants that vary over households such that E(c:ijiXiJ,
Zij, IL}) = 0.
One possible way of resolving the endogeneity of
credit is to determine whether there is any exogenous eligibility criteria used by lenders in selecting
borrowers. Such an eligibility rule was used by Pitt
and Khandker (1998) to sort out the endogeneity of
credit obtained from micro-credit programs such as
the Grameen Bank. They used a quasi-experimental
survey design as an identification strategy in a setting where eligible and non-eligible households based
on landholding were interviewed in both program and
control areas. Such an eligibility-based instrumentation is not appropriate for assessing the impacts of
ADBP loans, since the ADBP has no exogenous loan
eligibility criteria.
Finding convincing instruments (Zij variables) is
therefore a critical part of this exercise. According to
demand theory, the price can be a good instrument
for predicting the demand for a good. The price of an
ADBP loan is its interest rate, which hardly varies.
Hence, the interest rate cannot be a good predictor
of the demand for credit. We propose a set of instruments based on the assumption that the loanable
fund of the ADBP is fixed and the demand for ADBP
loans is much larger. Moreover, the ADBP disburses
much more than what it mobilises as savings and its
loanable funds mostly come from the government and
donors. In this case, it is not the price of a loan but
the availability of the fund that matters most in determining how much a household can borrow from the
ADBP. That brings us to the loan allocation hierarchy
of ADBP funds based on the competition among borrowers. ADBP funds are first allocated at the province
level, then at the district level, and then at village
level before they are finally disbursed to borrowing
households. At the district level certain districts are
preferred to others based on certain criteria and allocations are made to those districts. In those districts
again, certain villages are preferred to others and funds
are made available to those villages accordingly. Finally funds are disbursed to certain households based
on their qualifications. So these funds are subject to
competition at each level and the final disbursement
is the cumulative outcome of all competitions.
So given the available funds, a household's borrowing from the ADBP depends not only on its own

203

characteristics but also on the characteristics of other
competing households who also seek ADBP loans.
The competitor's characteristics are possible instruments in the borrowing equation. The competitors can
be at the village level as well as at the district level
where their characteristics would influence a particular household's demand for credit without influencing
its outcomes, such as consumption and investment.
Thus, for the allocation of a scarce fixed fund, formal financial institutions such as the ADBP would
consider the characteristics of individuals, such as education and landownership of borrowers. 11 But while
these characteristics of a borrower living in a district
are important, similar characteristics for other competing districts are also important in determining the fund
allocation in a particular district. So, at the national
level we calculate not only the averages of household
indicators for district k but also the same for other districts excluding k. Then within the district k we calculate averages for both village j and other villages
excluding j.
For each village we calculate similar averages of
household variables. These competitors' indicators
are then the instruments for identifying how much a
household can obtain from ADBP. So the Eq. (2) can
be rewritten as

+ XU-i)ka + x1k1J + Xk-JP + Xko
+ X p-kA + IL} +ILk: + c:ij
(2a)

CiJk = XiJkf3

where the additional subscript is introduced to indicate district (k). For example, Cijk represents credit of
household i in village j and district k, and ILk: is the
11 The idea is, given a fixed amount of loanable funds, the more
creditworthy the household's competitors are (as perceived by a
lender such as the ADBP), the less likely the household will be to
get credit. Creditworthiness may mean different things to different
lenders. For example, if lenders look at the amount of landholding in deciding whether to give loans, a household may be less
likely to obtain a loan if its competitors hold more land on average. Another lender may focus on household head's education and
yet another lender may take village characteristics into consideration in deciding on creditworthiness. Even if the within-village
competitors' characteristics may not be good instruments because
of 'spill-over' or 'social capital' arguments, the characteristics of
other villages in other districts are still valid instruments, as they
are unlikely to have any spill-over effect. In any case, we carry
out a specification test to justify whether they are valid instruments, implying whether 2SLS model is more appropriate than
OLS model (where the amount of loan is taken as given).

Borrowing reflects three possible outcomes: (i) no
borrowing for lack of access to the ADBP; (ii) no borrowing when households decide not to borrow, even if
the ADBP is there; and (iii) a positive amount of borrowing, given that the household decides to borrow
and the ADBP branch is available. The coefficient of
credit in Eq. (la) measures the impact of one more
rupee of borrowing from a formal source, such as
the ADBP, on household outcomes such as consumption, allowing the household to adjust its borrowing
'portfolio' and all other behaviours, in response. 12
Although the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) is
better since it yields efficient estimates, running MLE
is a cumbersome process compared to the two-stage
method which provides consistent estimates. Hence,
we use a two-stage method to estimate the impact of
credit.

5. Estimates of credit impact
In order to distinguish the results based on two-stage
method just discussed with those that do not account
for possible selection bias, we present both sets of results for outcomes of particular interest. Data on borrowing from the ADBP and other formal sources is
given for each household over the 5 years preceding
the survey. The cumulative amount of borrowing from
formal sources over the 5 year period is the policy
variable. This would reflect the long-term decision of
12 We know that the rural credit market is segmented because of
restricted information flow. So there are other lenders in addition
to the ADBP serving different market segments. But our focus is
on the ADBP and we are interested in the additional role that it can
play in raising household welfare, given the role of other lenders.

We use observable household characteristics including the highest grades completed by a male and a female, the total numbers of adult males and females in
the household, the sex and age of the household head,
and land owned by the household as independent variables. Village characteristics, including the prices of
rice, wheat, gram, milk products, beef, fish, vegetables, molasses and sugar, fruits and maize are also
used to control for village effects in the regression,
which may reflect the 'distance effect'. The cumulative amount of credit taken by the households from the
ADBP, or the households' status of borrowing from
the ADBP over the last 5 years prior to the survey, is
used as a separate explanatory variable in the welfare
equation, although it is the dependent variable in the
first stage regression.
The first stage to bit regression includes competitors'
characteristics as instrumental variables. Table 6 gives
13 For many households the observed amount of credit from the
ADBP is zero. This is why observed credit is a truncated variable,
and a tobit specification is appropriate for tbe cumulative borrowing
equation.

summary statlstlcs of these variables excluding the
village price variables. Table 7 presents the tobit estimates of the borrowing Eq. (2a). The significance of
the education variables in the first stage tobit regression for ADBP loans indicates that policies directed
towards increasing the flow of information may improve access to ADBP loans. Note that households
with educated members take more formal credit. Similarly, households with more land enjoy greater access
to formal loans. But the education and landholding of
the competitors of the same community seem to reduce a household's borrowing, given its education and
landholding. Note also that communities with higher

male education and higher average household landholding tend to receive a higher allocation of ADBP
loans.
We use the logarithmic specification for both the
cumulative amount of credit and the other outcome
equations of interest. Table 8 summarises the effects
of formal credit on selected household welfare outcomes. For comparison, we present both the OLS
and the two-stage results. Full regression results of
the two-stage equation can be found in Appendix A
(Table A.l). While the two-stage results control for endogeneity of credit, the ordinary least squares (OLS)
estimates assume that credit is randomly given.

The Durbin-Wu-Hausman test simply tests the significance of the
residual value that is predicted in the first stage regression and
included in the second stage regression.

To determine whether 2SLS (where endogeneity is
controlled using the competitors' characteristics as instruments) is more appropriate than OLS, we carried
out the Durbin-Wu-Hausman (DWH) test, which basically calculates an F-statistic for the residual term
that is predicted from the first stage Eq. (2a) and then
used as an explanatory variable in the second stage
Eq. (1). 14 Table 9 reports the test results. They show
that in four out of six outcomes there are systematic
differences between the two models. This means in
these cases, the OLS results show that the amount of
credit from formal sources cannot be taken as given,
and it responds to the same variables that affect the
outcomes of interest. Hence, the two-stage estimates
are preferred over the OLS estimates.
14 The second stage equation uses both the credit variable and
the predicted residual as explanatory variables.

The two-stage estimates reported in Table 8 measure the response elasticity of outcome with respect
to borrowing from the ADBP. They reveal that ADBP
credit has a positive impact on household per capita
consumption, for example. Thus, a 10% increase in
borrowing increases consumption by 0.04% for formal loans. Formal credit also increases crop production expenses of rural households. One major purpose
of credit is to support production costs such as hiring labour or purchasing fertiliser and other inputs. A
10% increase in borrowing from the ADBP increases
agricultural production costs by about 1%.
The effect of ADBP credit on the net value of agricultural production (i.e. gross value of production less
variable production cost) is positive and significant.
A 10% increase in borrowing from a formal source
increases agricultural production by almost by 1%.
ADBP loans also increase female labour supply, without having any significant effect on male labour supply. The elasticity of the response of female labour
supply with respect to formal credit is 0.098, implying that a 10% increase in formal lending is associated with a roughly 1% increase in female labour
supply.
We calculate the marginal impact of ADBP loans
based on the estimated response elasticities at the
mean values of both outcome and credit variables,
based on the preferred 2SLS model. Table 10 provides
these estimates which can be considered marginal
returns to borrowing from the ADBP for different outcomes of interest. Results indicate that the marginal
return of borrowing from the ADBP is 5% to consumption and 69% to net farm production.

6. The AD BPs cost of lending
How much does it cost the ADBP to lend to the
farming community in Pakistan? The costs of and benefits (income) from lending by a formal lender such
as the ADBP are based on the costs of lending and
interest income derived from lending. In addition to
lending, investment and other businesses that a bank
undertakes can generate income. These can be found
in the bank's annual report which provides a statement of income and expenditure from its activities.
However, the annual report of the ADBP does not
reflect the true cost of its activities. For example, it
receives subsidised funds from the government and
donors, and the annual report does not reflect the opportunity cost of such funds (PIDE, 1998). In order
to assess ADBPs true cost of lending, we must account for the subsidies it receives since these subsidies come at a cost to the government and the society.
Since an overwhelming portion of the formal loans
comes from the ADBP (86.5% as shown in Table 3),
the cost of (that is, the net subsidy provided to) the
ADBP can be used to represent the costs of formal
lenders.
The subsidies to the ADBP come from interest-free
grants and concessionary funds (that are obtained at
below-market interest rates). The subsidy from concessional funds is defined as the difference between
the market interest rate (which is the opportunity cost
of the subsidised funds) and the actual interest rate
times the total value of the funds. Since no interest
is charged on grants, the subsidy from grants is the
market interest rate times the grant amount. The total subsidy provided to the ADBP is the sum of these

207

two subsidies plus equity subsidy calculated from annual equity. The net subsidy is the subsidy after the
profit is netted out. As Table ll shows, the net subsidy of ADBP increased from 1685 million rupees in
1991 to 3312 million rupees in 1995 (Qureshi et al.,
1999). This increase was due to the increase in borrowing funds and equity that occurred while interest
rates remained largely constant. The average subsidy
was 4.7% of the loans outstanding in 1991 and 7.5%
in 1995. 15
The nominal interest rate of ADBP loans increased
slightly from 1991 to 1995 and from 12.5 to 13.5%.
The rate of inflation during this period increased from
9.6% in 1991 to 13.9% in 1993, and then decreased to
10.4% in 1995. The data clearly show that the real rate
of interest on an ADBP loan was negative for most of
the time during the study period. So one way of reducing the subsidy dependence of the ADBP would be to
increase the nominal interest rate it changes. To determine how much the nominal rate of interest would
have to be increased to eliminate the subsidy, we use
the subsidy dependence index (SDI) measure (Yaron,
1992). The SDI is expressed as the net subsidy (total
subsidy less accounting profit) as a percentage of interest income received from on-lending (which is in tum
defined as the average loan outstanding times the nominal interest rate). The SDI measures the percentage increase in the average on-lending interest rate required
to eliminate all subsidies in a given year while keeping the return on equity equal to the non-concession
borrowing cost. Between 1991 and 1995, the SDI increased from 0.38 to 0.56. Thus, in order to eliminate
subsidy it receives, the ADBP would have had to increase the on-lending interest rate by 38% in 1991
and by 56% in 1995. Using the nominal rate for those
years, this means that the nominal rate should have
increased from 12.5 to 17.2% in 1991 and from 13.5
to 21% in 1995.
Another way of reducing subsidy dependence is to
improve the loan recovery rate. Loan recovery has
been a major concern for all government-run credit

15 The subsidy provided to the ADBP is comparable with that
of other successful financial institutions around the world. For
example, the Grameen Bank of Bangladesh, which is a role model
for micro-credit programs worldwide, enjoyed a subsidy rate of
5.6% in 1994 (Khandker, 1988). But unlike the Grameen Bank,
ADBP loans are received mostly by large landholders.

institutions worldwide and Pakistan is no exception.
The ADBPs loan recovery rate was 59% in 1991 for
all past loans and declined further to 45% in 1996
(Table 12). Most interestingly, as we found earlier, the
bulk of ADBP loans are received by large landowners, who are generally able to repay the loan. Yet
because of their political clout they do not repay in
many cases and get away with it. As a result, the loan
recovery of the state-controlled ADBP has suffered
a lot.
A final way of reducing the subsidy dependence of
the ADBP is to make it more dependent on its own
resources for lending, i.e. to require it to mobilise
savings to support its lending. This savings-based
lending practice would make it more accountable
for its loan disbursement, repayment and the cost
of operation. From 1991 to 1996, the ADBPs savings and deposits accounted for only 23% of its loan

7. Cost-effectiveness of the ADBP
If the subsidy dependence of the ADBP cannot be
fully avoided, can it be justified in terms of the social
benefits that it generates? We have discovered that
the ADBP is not a cost-effective delivery system as
it depends on subsidies. Despite the high loan default
costs and subsidy dependence, it is important to find
out whether it is efficient from the perspective of the
social objective to deliver targeted credit. Since the
delivery of farm credit embodies government policies,
it is worth exploring whether it is cost-effective to
deliver farm credit through the ADBP. Alternatively, as
ADBP loans are highly politicised and loans are often
not repaid (Qureshi et al., 1999), the question worth
exploring is who are the beneficiaries of its subsidised
operation, and whether the society benefits from such
operation.
We assess the social cost-effectiveness of the
ADBP by looking at the ratio of social costs to social benefits. As indicated earlier, the social cost of
the program is measured by the net subsidy provided to the ADBP. In 1995 the ADBP received a net
subsidy of 3312 million rupees (Table 11). Benefits
are measured from the impacts of ADBP loans on
household consumption, where higher consumption

means a reduction of poverty. 16 Social benefits can
be calculated in two ways: one based on average
benefits accruing to all borrower households, and the
other based on the sum of benefits accruing to different groups of households based on their operational
holdings. Based on operational holdings, households
are categorised into three groups: smallholders (operational holding up to 12.5 acres), medium holders
(operational holding between 12.5 and 25 acres) and
large holders (operational holding over 25 acres).
Like the impact estimates based on the entire sample
of households, two-stage regressions were carried out
for the three groups of households separately to estimate the marginal returns to consumptions for these
households.
The ADBP had a total loan portfolio of 44,160.31
million rupees in 1995 and we assume that the dis16 The impact of credit on consumption is taken as a measure
of social benefit for calculating cost-benefit ratios. Credit is used
for production and consumption. The loan used for consumption
increases consumption directly by helping consume more and
indirectly by increasing labour productivity through sustaining the
consumption required for maintaining physical strength of a person.
Credit used for production increases income and net worth which
in turn help increase the consumption. Hence, the consumption
impacts measure the appropriate social benefits of credit.

tribution of this portfolio among different operational
holding was the same as observed in our sample. Using sample weights we determine the amount of credit
that each group received from the ADBP. This amount,
when multiplied by the marginal return to consumption, provides an average amount of benefit for
different categories of ADBP borrowers. Aggregating
benefits across groups results in a program-level benefit of 2485 million rupees, leading to a society-level
cost-benefit ratio of 1.347 (3312/2458) (Table 13).
Hence, the social cost of ADBP lending exceeded the
social benefit by as much as 35% in 1995. This is very
similar to the estimated cost-benefit ratio (1.331) of
ADBP lending based on the single equation run for
the entire sample. We conclude that ADBP lending is
not socially profitableP
Since the social benefit of ADBP lending is positive only for small producers, the question is whether
17 Note that this is calculated using the estimates of marginal
returns. Ideally one should use the average returns, which, under
the assumption of diminishing returns, are higher than marginal
returns. If average returns are higher than marginal returns, it is
possible that the ADBP may be cost-effective. Nonetheless, based
on the same type of analysis, the ADBP seems less cost-effective
than the Grameen Bank of Bangladesh, which is highly successful
in reaching the poor households, especially women.

it would be socially profitable if it were disbursed exclusively to smallholders. The re-calculation of the
social benefits and the cost-benefit ratio for ADBP
lending shows that benefits exceed costs by 73% (the
cost-benefit ratio is 0.58) in the case (Table 13). Therefore, even if the ADBP is subsidised, a better targeting
of its operations could make it worth supporting by
society. Of course, this does not mean that the ADBP
must receive subsidies. It means that if a subsidy is
a necessary condition for running a highly targeted
scheme in rural areas, the generated benefits should be
large enough so that society would find it worth supporting. It follows that the ADBP must be redesigned
to reach the poor households and small producers. If it
cannot improve outreach, then its current subsidy dependence cannot be justified, as its loans are largely
benefiting medium and large landlords, who should
not qualify for receiving subsidised credit.

8. Conclusions and policy implications
The purpose of this study was to provide econometric evidence on the impact of farm credit on household welfare and the role of the state-owned ADBP.
Like past studies, we find statistically significant effects of institutional credit not only on the determinants of agricultural output, but also on household
consumption and other household welfare indicators.
Like earlier studies, we also find evidence of poor
access of small landowners to formal credit. Clearly,
formal lenders are biased towards larger farmers who
can provide collateral, and as a result smaller and tenant farmers are left out. In Pakistan, large landowners,
who constitute only 4% of rural households, account
for 42% of formal finance, while subsistence households, who constitute more than 69% of rural households, receive only 23% of formal loans.
Formal loans are taken mostly for production purposes. Data shows that only 5% offormalloans finance
consumption, and an overwhelming 95% support production (88% to farm and 7% to non-farm production). In contrast, 56% of informal loans were used for
consumption, while 44% were used to support production. These production loans are used for income generation, which can then support higher consumption.
Thus, the effect of such loans on consumption is indirect. If household consumption is taken as a measure

211

of household welfare, the estimated marginal impact
of formal loans on consumption is substantial. An additional 100 rupees of loan from a formal source such
as the ADBP can increase per capita consumption by
as much as 5 rupee. When the impacts of credit are
estimated by operational landholding, the distribution
of benefits is found to vary by the size of operational
holding. In particular, the returns to consumption of
borrowing from the ADBP are as much as 13% for
smallholders (who own up to 2.5 acres of land) compared with 0% for medium and large farmers.
Is ADBP lending cost-effective? Using some estimates of the net cost that is not recovered from its income, we find that the ADBP is subsidised, even more
subsidised than the Grameen Bank of Bangladesh, a
highly donor dependent and poor-focused micro-credit
program. 18 Using the subsidy provided to the ADBP
as the cost of delivering formal credit to rural households, estimates show that the government of Pakistan
has to provide a subsidy of 7.5% of its loans outstanding (as of 1995) to support ADBP operations; otherwise the ADBP cannot run its business. Reduction
of subsidies could be accomplished through cost savings such as reducing loan default costs and by raising
nominal interest rates to a level that at least reflects
a positive real on-lending rate. The ADBP could also
practice self-reliance by relying more on mobilised deposits and savings, and less on government and donor
resources for on-lending.
More importantly, the ADBP may find it necessary
to extend its outreach so as to reach out the poor and
the asset-less, whose repayment record is better than
that of large holders. Results suggest that institutional
credit is productive, but that its outreach is limited to
a small proportion of the population that perhaps does
not need subsidised credit. There is little doubt that
credit channelled in the right direction has significant
anti-poverty effects, and that broadening the outreach
of formal lending institutions would represent a step
in the right direction.
