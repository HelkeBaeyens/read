Abstract
In some cultures inheritance customs results in land fragmentation such that over time operating farms become
composed of a collection of spatially dispersed fields rather than a contiguous land unit. This study was conducted to
determine the impact of land fragmentation as measured by average field size on the average cost of producing
wheat in the rain-fed region of Northern Jordan. Primary data were collected from farmers in the region.
Generalized Least Squares was used to estimate the average variable cost of producing wheat. It was determined
that the average variable cost of producing wheat is a decreasing function of field size. Land fragmentation increases
production costs. Continued land fragmentation will lead to decreasing efficiency and is problematic when it results
in small fields.

1. Introduction

Small farm size and land fragmentation have
been hypothesized to be impediments to economical wheat production in Jordan. They are believed to be a principal cause of Jordan's low
productivity and major obstacles to the development of the rain-fed agricultural region (ElHurani and Duwayri, 1986).
In some cultures the desire to leave each heir
an equal portion of the farm leads farmers to
divide each field in each generation (Binns, 1950).

Partial inheritance leads to ever-diminishing field
size (Clout, 1972; Moore, 1972; Burton and King,
1983). Operating farms are often composed of a
collection of spatially dispersed fields rather than
a contiguous land unit.
Land fragmentation is defined as the division
of a single farm into several separate, distinct
parcels (Binns, 1950). Many developed and developing countries encounter a land fragmentation
problem. Some consider land fragmentation to be
a major impediment to efficient field crop production (Binns, 1950; Dovering, 1965; Grigg, 1983;
Jacoby, 1971; Karouzis, 1971; King and Burton,
1982). Small and irregular fields increase the costs
of moving workers and equipment and reduces
the field efficiency of machines relative to that

obtainable in large, rectangular fields (Buller and
Bruning, 1979).
While there are costs associated with land
fragmentation, under some circumstances spatial
dispersion may be beneficial. An individual farmer
who manages several dispersed parcels may exploit differences in elevation or soil type by
scheduling plantings to reduce risk and distribute
labor requirements over time (Bentley, 1987). In
addition, fields in different zones may permit a
farmer to produce a more diversified portfolio of
crops (Cole and Wolf, 1974; Forbes, 1976; Friedl,
1974; Weinberg, 1972). In mountain regions, crops
at lower elevations mature before those at higher
elevations. A farm family may exploit differences
in elevation to synchronize harvest with available
family labor, reduce requirements for hired labor,
and spread out fresh food supplies over time
(Netting, 1972; Forbes, 1976; Friedl, 1974; Galt,
1979).
Land fragmentation may facilitate risk management through diversification even in relatively
homogeneous environments such as that found in
the Great Plains of the USA For example, hail
storms are often localized such that the probability of a total loss is less for a farmer with spatially
dispersed land tracts. Similarly, rain from thunderstorms is often localized such that some fields
may produce well in certain years, while others
do well in other years (Carlyle, 1983; Heston and
Kumar, 1983).

2. Land fragmentation in Jordan

One factor which influences land fragmentation in Jordan is the law which governs the partitioning of land into a single landholding. Outside
the city or village limits, the minimum size of a
landholding which can be divided into a separate
holding is one hectare. However, the law permits
for common ownership of one single piece of
land (in some areas as small as one-tenth hectare).
Common ownership is a routine consequence of
inheritance under Islamic law or purchase. Land
owned by an individual passes to heirs after death.
Available data indicate that the average farm
size in the rain-fed regions of Jordan is 8 ha
(Agricultural Statistics Indicator, 1988). However,
most farms are composed of dispersed parcels.
The average landholding is divided into 2.5 pieces
such that the average contiguous field size in one
location is 32 dunums (a dunum is one-tenth of a
hectare).
Arabiat and Al-Kadi (1988), concluded that
the degree of agricultural land fragmentation as
measured by an index they developed, is very
high in northern Jordan. Qasem (1985) has reported that land fragmentation is a continuous
process. The number of individuals who acquired
ownership rights increased every year from 1976
to 1981. The data in Table 1 show that in 1976,
for example, 2657 individually owned land parcels
changed ownership in Jordan. The ownership of

these parcels was transferred to 7033 individuals.
During the period from 1976 to 1981, a total of
17 668 individually owned parcels were transferred to 59 070 individuals. The number of owners of the transferred land almost tripled. These
data do not address the issue of parcel dispersion
for individual farmers. While the number of owners may have increased, data are not available to
determine the change in the number of farmers
over this time period.
Data are not available to directly measure the
impact of decreasing parcel size on farm size or
the size of fields farmed. For example, a single
farmer may acquire the rights to farm a number
of contiguous but independently owned parcels
through various tenancy arrangements. However,
for a given size of farm, the transactions costs of
renting could be expected to be an increasing
function of the number of landlords. For example, a farmer with 100 units of land and two
landlords is likely to incur less transactions cost
than a farmer with 100 units of land and twenty
landlords. An underlying assumption of the analysis presented in this paper is that the average
field size available for farming decreases as the
number of individual land owners increases.
Arabiat and Al-Kadi (1988) have determined
that land fragmentation is a serious problem in
Jordan. The analysis presented by Qasem (1985)
indicates that the degree of land fragmentation
has increased. However, it remains to be determined if this fragmentation reduces economic
efficiency or alternatively, if the benefits of fragmentation exceed the costs. No research has been
conducted to measure the impact of fragmentation on production costs.
The objective of the research reported in this
paper is to determine if field size influences production costs. One measure of economic efficiency is average per unit production costs. Hence,
the specific objective is to estimate the average
variable costs of producing wheat in the rain-fed
region of Northern Jordan and to determine if
land fragmentation as measured by average field
size is beneficial, costly, or an insignificant factor.
The results are expected to be of use to those
Jordanian farmers who have flexibility regarding
field size. In addition, the results may be of value

193

to those responsible for setting and modifying
Jordanian public policies which influence land
fragmentation.

3. Data and model
Primary data were collected by personal interviews of 63 farmers in the northern part of Jordan. The survey was conducted in July 1992 to
obtain information regarding production practices. The area is relatively homogeneous. However, for the statistical analysis the farms were
classified into one of three adjacent geographical
regions. The regions differ slightly in elevation,
soil, and expected precipitation.
Wheat enterprise cost and return budgets were
prepared for each farm. The cost of land preparation, seed, seeding, fertilizer, combine or stationary thresher rental, hired harvest labor, and
sacks were included as variable costs. Costs of
land use, family labor, overhead and management
were not obtained in the survey, and were not
included as variable costs. The average variable
cost of producing wheat was generated for each
farm by dividing the total variable costs by yield
and is expressed in terms of Jordanian dinar per
kilogram (JD /kg) of wheat produced.
Some of the farmers reported that they used a
traditional harvest method which requires the
transfer of wheat shocks from the field to a
stationary thresher for grain separation. Others
reported that they hired a custom harvester who
used a combine. All farmers who were surveyed
and who reported the use of fertilizer indicated
that they used ammonium sulfate. The fertilizer
levels are expressed in kg of fertilizer used per
dunum. Wheat grain yield is expressed in kg per
dunum.
To determine if field size influences production costs, the estimated average variable cost is
fitted as a function of the production region,
fertilizer applied, harvest method, land seeded to
wheat on the farm, and average wheat field size.
The full model is represented in Eq. 1. The
primary purpose of the model is to determine if
production efficiency as measured by the average

where Ave; represents cost of land preparation,
seed, seeding, fertilizer, combine rental, thresher

region two and 0 otherwise; FERT; is fertilizer
level in kg per dunum used on farm i; HARV; = 1
if the wheat on farm i was harvested with a
combine and 0 if harvested with a stationary
thresher; SIZE; is land area (dunums) seeded to

4. Statistical method

The Glejser test confirmed the presence of
heteroskedasticity which is a common problem
with cross-sectional data (Kennedy, 1989; Berndt,
1991; Judge et al., 1985; Salvatore, 1982). Heteroskedasticity is the term used to describe the
violation of the ordinary least squares assumption
that all the disturbance (error) terms have the
same variance. In these instances ordinary least
squares generates inefficient estimates of the
standard errors and thus incorrect statistical tests.
Because of the presence of heteroskedasticity,
Estimated Generalized Least Squares (EGLS)

(Judge et al., 1985) was used to estimate the
model. A three-step procedure was used to obtain the EGLS estimates. In the first step, ordinary least squares was used to fit the model. The
absolute values of the ordinary least squares
residuals from the first step were regressed on
the independent variables of the full model. The
predicted residuals obtained from the second step
were squared and their reciprocals were used to
weight the original variables. The weighted average variable cost values were regressed on the
weighted independent variables to obtain the
EGLS parameter estimates.

5. Results

Statistical results are presented in Table 2.
The first model includes two regional dummy
variables, the dummy variable for harvest method,
and continuous variables for fertilizer, land
seeded to wheat, and average field size. Based
upon the t-tests, the use of fertilizer decreases
the average variable cost of producing wheat. The
use of a combine also decreases average variable
cost. The estimated coefficient for the land seeded
to wheat on the farm variable is not statistically
significant. However, the average field size variable is significant.
The variable for farm size (land seeded to
wheat) was dropped and Model 2 was estimated.
All parameter estimates in Model 2 are significant at the 191a level except for the intercept

shifting dummy variable for region 2. The F-statistics for both models are also significant at the
1% level. The results indicate that fertilization,
harvest method, and average field size significantly influence the variable cost of producing a
kilogram of wheat.
The model confirms the hypothesis that average variable cost is a decreasing function of average field size. Average variable cost of producing
wheat on the farms included in the survey is
greater with small fields. That is, land fragmentation is an economically important issue.
Table 3 includes estimates of the A VC of
producing wheat for three alternative field sizes
based on parameter estimates of Model 2. As the
field size increases the average variable cost decreases. A further decrease in the average variable cost resulted when as the fertilizer level was
increased from zero to 10.3 kgjdunum which was
the average level of fertilizer applied by those
farmers who used fertilizer. For a given field size
(AFS), say 20 dunums, the AVC decreases from
JD 0.175 to JD 0.141, when the fertilizer level
increases from 0.0 kgjdunum to 10.3 kgjdunum.
In other words the A VC curve shifts up, indicating an increase in the AVC when the field size
decreases.

6. Conclusions

Upon death of the owner, it is common for
agricultural land in the rain-fed region of northern Jordan to be divided among heirs. Over time

195

the size of an average land holding has decreased. This process of land fragmentation has
been cited as a major impediment to efficient
production of field crops. However, the consequences of land fragmentation on the cost of
producing wheat in Jordan has not been determined.
The objective of the research reported in this
paper was to determine if field size influences
production costs. The specific objective was to
determine if land fragmentation as measured by
average size of wheat fields is beneficial, costly,
or an insignificant factor. Primary data were obtained from a sample of 63 Jordanian farmers.
Estimated Generalized Least Squares was used
to derive parameter estimates. Land fragmentation as reflected in average field size was found
to be significant. The average variable costs of
producing a kilogram of wheat in the region
increases as the average field size decreases.
The modelling effort leads to several implications. Land fragmentation is indeed an impediment to efficient wheat production in the region.
Clearly, within relatively large families, if land
division among heirs is continued over several
generations, at some point, fields would become
so small that they could not be farmed. Individual
farmers may have limited options to increase
average field size and thus reduce average variable cost of production. However, if the land
market is fluid, as the average field size decreases
and the cost of production increases, there is an
incentive for an entrepreneur to acquire and
combine small adjacent plots into larger more
efficient fields. The question remains as to what
type of public policies may be put into place to
reduce the degree of land fragmentation or to
mitigate the cost imposed by land fragmentation.
If the land market in the region is well developed, there may be some possibility for individual
farmers to increase average field size by acquiring
the rights to farm contiguous units. The transactions costs of working with numerous landlords
has not been addressed. It is not clear if government policy can contribute to this process. However, it is clear that continued land fragmentation, will lead to decreasing efficiency and is
problematic when it results in small fields.
