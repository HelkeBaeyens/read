Abstract
The study takes a historical perspective to trace the path of evolutionary reforms in agricultural input markets of
Bangladesh. It estimates the magnitude of the impact of these reforms on rice production, the most important crop
in Bangladesh agriculture. It is estimated that the production of rice could have been 20-32% lower than the level of
1992/1993, depending on the rice price that would have prevailed under alternative scenarios. The 20% credit to
market reform relates to a real rice price level 19% higher than the actual 1992/1993 prices. The 32% credit to
reform relates to the actual 1992/1993 price levels. The lower contribution of reform (20%) to increased production
implies a loss to consumers not accounted for in the production benefit of reform, while the higher contribution
(32%) of reform entails no loss to consumers. The bottom-line conclusion is that Bangladesh, without the market
reforms described in the paper, would have reverted back to the situation of regular food crisis and high rice prices,
as was the case historically.
The analysis of the process of reform provides interesting lessons for developing countries. A gradual process
based on a well-designed sequencing of various steps of market reform, particularly in the case of fertilizer, was a
crucial factor for success. Careful monitoring during the period of transition is another crucial factor that has to be
institutionalized in the system. Second generation problems of market reforms, particularly the emergence of an
oligopolistic market structure, are possible and warrant a cautionary watch.

1. Introduction

After a long period of chronic foodgrain shortages, Bangladesh has recently achieved a remarkable success in emerging as a marginally self-sufficient producer of rice. It is argued in this paper
that the market liberalization measures in agriculture made a significant contribution to this
success in rice production. Bangladesh is a country with about 115 million people, 21 million
acres of cultivated land, and 12 million farms
averaging about 1.8 acres of land per farm in

1990. Because of little scope for extensive farming, most of the increased production has had to
come from application of modern agricultural
inputs and intensive cultivation. The first serious
public effort for introduction of modern inputs in
agriculture began with the recommendations of
the Agricultural Commission of 1960 (Ahmed,
1978). A public parastatal, the East Pakistan
Agricultural Development Corporation (later
known as the Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation (BADC)), was established in
1963, following a recommendation from the Com-

mission. This parastatal was given the task of, and
resources for, procurement and distribution of
agricultural inputs such as fertilizers, seeds, agricultural equipment and pesticides.
The BADC soon developed an elaborate organization and physical capacities all over the country in order to deliver the goods and services to
farmers. It had a virtual monopoly over the four
agricultural input markets in Bangladesh, even
though it had to conform to the pricing and
related policies that the government used to formulate from time to time. The purpose of this
paper is to examine the process and measure the
impact of the recent liberalization of the agricultural input markets that were once vested in a
powerful public parastatal. It is hoped that in
doing so it will be possible to derive a few lessons
relevant to other developing countries.

2. Liberalization of input markets

The step-by-step liberalization of markets for
modern inputs in agriculture was carried out
partly under pressure from foreign donors and
partly on the realization that various direct interventions in these markets were unsustainable and
unproductive in a longer-term context.
2.1. Pre-liberalization structure of markets
2.1.1. Fertilizer market
The use of chemical fertilizers was primarily
limited to tea estates and to the extent of about
11400 nutrient tons in 1959-1960. A significant
spread of fertilizers to peasants began around the
time that BADC was established. The sale of
fertilizer by BADC in 1977/1978 was 354000
nutrient tons (equivalent to 725 000 material tons),
consisting of 65% N, 25% P2 0 5 , and 8% K 2 0
(see Appendix, Table A1). This is the picture of
progress in the consumption of fertilizer before
the process of liberalization was set in motion.
BADC was the sole organization procuring
fertilizers from domestic factories and foreign
sources. These fertilizers were first shipped to
transit warehouses, intermediate warehouses at
strategic points, and Thana Sales Centers (TSCs);

a thana is an administrative unit consisting of
about 80-90 villages. During 1963-1978, there
were 67 intermediate warehouses and 423 TSCs.
TSCs functioned as both wholesale and retail
points in the sense that these sources used to sell
fertilizers to private dealers for retailing to farmers as well as directly to farmers. The other
category of wholesalers was the Thana Central
Cooperative Associations (TCCAs) that sold fertilizers to private dealers and agricultural cooperatives at the village level for retail sales to farmers. The share of cooperatives in the total sale
was small, only about 12-17%. Private dealers
were appointed for sales to farmers through a
licensing procedure and only about three or four
dealers used to serve seven to ten villages. The
dealers were not supposed to sell outside a defined area. Dealers would procure fertilizers from
specified TSCs and sell to farmers at prices fixed
by the government. The fixed price included a
commission based on the distance from the TSC
to the operation center. Dealers were required to
maintain registers, which were subject to occasional inspection by BADC officers. Excluding
the commission prices of fertilizers were supposed to be uniform throughout the country. The
system suffered from numerous problems arising
from excessive bureaucratic controls.
2.1.2. Irrigation equipment
BADC started the low-lift pump irrigation
(lifting water from surface sources to adjoining
fields) using diesel engines and distribution pipes,
mainly for reclamation of Haor areas of Sylhet
and Mymensingh districts (Haor is a lake-like
depression in low-lying marshy stretches of land).
Most of these engines were of 2 cusec capacity.
BADC used to own, maintain, and operate these
pumping sets to supply water to groups of farms
on the basis of a flat charge per acre. At the
beginning, the charges covered only about 60% of
the operating cost. This experiment in Haor areas
led to a rapid expansion of the scheme throughout the country along riverbanks, large ponds,
and lakes. Operation of a large fleet of pumping
sets became an unwieldy task and expensive too.
Therefore, by the end of the 1960s, some reforms
were introduced. Farmers were required to orga-

R. Ahmed/ Agricultural Economics 12 (1995) 115-128

nize into irrigation groups, supply all diesel fuel
costs, and pay a share of the maintenance cost at
flat rates per acre of irrigated land. Farm groups
were responsible for water management, diesel
fuel, and collection of charges. By the mid-1970s
a rental system was introduced, whereby BADC's
responsibility was only to supply an operationally
good pumping set on a rental basis and farm
groups had to bear all costs, including wages of
pump operators.
Tube-well irrigation is the other mode of
small-scale irrigation development in Bangladesh.
This is suitable for areas where surface water is
not available and underground water is the next
best source of water supply. The first program on
tube-well irrigation was initiated by the Bangladesh Water Development Board in the early 1960s
with 90 tube-wells of 2-3 cusec capacity engines
in northern Bangladesh. For many years, the project could not successfully attract farmers, even
with 100% subsidy. BADC began a deep tube-well
program (2 cusec capacity) around the time when
its low-lift pump program reached saturation. In
the meantime, Camilla Academy for Rural Development was successfully experimenting with
shallow tube-wells of 0.25-1 cusec capacity
through cooperative societies. These shallow
tube-wells were found to be much cheaper than
BADC tube-wells. The Camilla Academy also
implemented a program of training for development of private sector tube-well installation capacity in the country. BADC started a modest
tube-well irrigation program based on 2 cusec
wells as early as 1970. Initially, BADC operated
these tube-wells on the same principles for low-lift
pumps. Around 1978 BADC was asked to install
tube-wells for farmers on payment of the subsidized cost (20-30% subsidy). Except for these
publicly initiated programs of tube-well irrigation,
there was hardly any private initiative in the
development of modern irrigation until the mid1970s.
Irrigation equipment (engines, pumps, etc.) had
all along a small private market for use in nonagricultural purposes. BADC's equipment was
mostly imported under foreign aid. Domestic capacity for production of diesel engines and pumps
was small. Therefore, liberalization of import

117

trade became the key element of market liberalization in agricultural equipment. Before the
mid-1980s, the following types of import restrictions were in effect.
(a) Private import of diesel engines for irrigation
was not allowed except for makes and models
approved by a Standardization Committee in
the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) and with
special permission from MOA.
(b) Private import of pumps for irrigation was not
allowed except with MOA permission, with
foreign exchange through a donor-funded
project, and with no objection from the Ministry of Industries.
2.1.3. Cultivation equipment
As with other modern inputs in agriculture,
BADC started a mechanized cultivation scheme
based on tractors from the inception of BADC.
However, experiments with tractors became unsuccessful rather quickly. Thereafter, the PakJapan (later known as Bangladesh-Japan) Cooperative Scheme on Agricultural Machineries successfully introduced power tillers for plowing of
land by farmers. However, no special public
agency was created, as had been done for other
inputs, for marketing and distribution of power
tillers. Private importers and distributors have
been performing this function, since some demand for power tillers has been felt in the market. Medium-to-large farms purchase power tillers
for renting to neighbors and for meeting their
own draft requirements. Thus the domestic market was free but the import market was constrained. Before the mid-1980s, private import of
power tillers was not allowed except for makes
and models approved by a standardization committee in the MOA (Gisselquist, 1992).
2.1.4. Pesticides
BADC was given the task of procurement of
plant protection materials, and the Agricultural
Extension Department was supposed to conduct
operations for crop protection. Because of numerous complexities in the storage and handling
of poisonous materials and in dispensing these
materials to farmers, and because of the recognition that a bureaucratic agency can hardly take

118

R. Ahmed/Agricultural Economics 12 (1995) 115-128

timely measures against pests, the ground measures of crop protection, including procurement
and distribution of pesticides were privatized at
the end of the 1960s. Private importers began
importing and distributing pesticides through private dealers and general retailers of consumer
goods. However, import of pesticides by private
dealers was allowed only for approved brands
and approved dealers with permission from MOA.
This approval process might have implied hidden
costs for traders, and import only by brand names
was potentially oligopolistic. A 1991 study by
Canada's Agricultural Sector Team in Bangladesh
found pesticide prices as much as double the

prices in Pakistan despite the absence of tariffs
(Canadian Agency for International Development, 1991).
2.1.5. Seeds
The traditional seed markets in Bangladesh
involve farmers producing seed for their own use
and for sale to markets. Those who need seeds
buy from the market. It is not uncommon for
some farmers to specialize in the production of
seeds. These traditional markets have been the
channel of distribution not only among farmers
within the country but also between adjoining
farmers of Bangladesh and India. The other

channel that provides improved varieties developed in research stations is the public system.
BADC has been operating about 19 seed multiplication farms for production and distribution of
such improved seeds of various crops. The government has developed a seed certification mechanism for ensuring quality. But complaints that
publicly produced seeds are frequently of poor
quality and not available in time are quite common.
BADC has imported seeds in the past in order
to introduce high yielding varieties (HYVs) of
crops. Examples of imports of Dutch potatoes
and Mexican wheat in order to increase production of these two crops are well-known. It is
believed that the liberalization of seed markets
aimed at promoting free and competitive international trade in seed would be a potent mechanism
of technological progress in the agriculture of
Bangladesh.

2.2. Reforms in input markets
The chronology of reforms in the agricultural
input markets is summarized in Table 1. Liberalization of the fertilizer and the irrigation equipment markets was the dominant feature of the
reform that produced a substantial impact on
production. In the case of fertilizer, the response
of private trade was very vigorous. It was estimated that 8000 wholesalers and 50 000 retailers
operated competitively in the fertilizer market by
1988 (Infanger et al., 1988). The share of private
trade went up quite fast; the share was 75% in
1989 and about 100% in 1992. Nevertheless, some
doubts still persist that the trade at the import
level may ultimately turn into an oligopolistic
structure because of economies of scale in importation and differential access of traders to capital
markets. Throughout the entire process of reform, a carefully designed mechanism of monitoring was working to identify emerging problems
and solve them in time.
Perhaps the most significant effect of reforms
was realized in the case of irrigation equipment.
By early 1989, the cost of a shallow tube-well
complete with sinking, pipe, pump, and engine, to
irrigate 4-5 ha of land, had fallen to below the

119

20 000 ($600) which is about 60% of the subsidized price for such equipment through BADC.
As a result, during the period 1988-1990, irrigated area expanded at a rate roughly twice as
quickly as had been achieved in 1978-1986. The
practice of using power tillers for cultivation is
still very thin in Bangladesh. The price of a power
tiller had decreased to $1500 in 1989 from $2500
only a few months before the liberalization of
import ( Gisselquist, 1992). The use of power tillers
is spreading faster than before due to the removal of import restrictions; liberalization of
markets for seeds and pesticides has only a modest implication for impact in the short run. But in
the long run their impact, particularly that of
seed, is likely to be perceptably large.

3. Impact of liberalization

The impact of liberalization can be assumed to
consist of two elements: (a) direct impact on
agricultural production due to changes in the
level of input use; (b) indirect impact on the
production of both agricultural and nonagricultural products arising from reallocation of budgetary savings achieved through reduction or
elimination of input subsidies. These savings are
likely to impact the price of foreign exchange,
which in turn may influence production. It is the
direct impact that is traced and measured in this
paper. Measurement of the indirect impact warrants an economy-wide modeling that is not attempted here. Nevertheless, some assessment of
the fiscal impact or the magnitude of a subsidy
that was eliminated from the budget is provided
here.
Detailed calculations indicate that the budgetary subsidy on fertilizers was of the order of
TK 1286 million ($83 million) in 1979/1980, TK
1426 million ($57 million) in 1983/1984, TK 1273
million ($40 million) in 1988/1989, and only about
TK 25 million ($0.6 million) in 1992/1993
(Ahmed, 1987; Renfroe, 1991; and personal contacts in the Bangladesh Ministry of Agriculture,
July 1993). The small subsidy in 1993 is meant for
correction of minor and trace-element deficiencies in certain soils. The 1983/1984 figure was

120

R. Ahmed j Agricultural Economics 12 (1995) 115-128

equivalent to about 14% of the total public development expenditure on agriculture and rural development, and the 1979/1980 figure was equivalent to 28% of such expenditure (International
Food Policy Research Institute, 1985). Budgetary
savings arising from liberalization of the fertilizer
market are quite significant. A comparable estimate of the subsidy for irrigation is not available.
However, the budgetary subsidy on the low-lift
and tube-well irrigation program of BADC was
estimated to be TK 1035 million ($66.7 million) in
1979/1980 and TK 830 million ($33 million) in
1983/1984 (Rashid, 1986). By 1986, almost the
entire subsidy on low-lift and tube-well irrigation
of BADC had been eliminated.

3.1. Model for measuring direct impact on rice
production
Although the impact of policy reform on aggregate production of rice is the objective, the
approach to measurement must be rooted in the
farm level behavior. Consider a typical farm with
a production function

(1)
where V is output, X represents variable inputs,
and Z represents fixed inputs and other shifter
variables of the function. The farm is seeking
maximization of profit
m

IT=PF(Xl""Xm; zl'"Zn)- LqjXj

(2)

j

where P is the unit price of output, qj is the unit
price of the jth variable input. The fixed costs are
conveniently ignored. The profit maximizing level
of input use is given by

(3)

By substitution of Eq. (4) into Eq. (2), the restricted profit function becomes

(5)

IT=G(P, q 1 ... qm; z 1 ... zn)

This general function gives maximized values for
the optimal sets of (q 1 .â¢. qm) so that

(6)

IT=G*(P,q 1 ... qm;z 1 .... zn)

It is possible to derive output supply and input

demand functions from Eq. (6) via Shepard's
(1970) lemma.
The output supply function

V*=IT(P,q,z)

(7)

and input demand function:

(8)

X/= Fj(P, q, z)

The function is negative in input prices.
Note that p and q can be expressed in relative
terms collapsing the two vectors into one of relative prices of output and input.
The values of v * and x/ relate to a typical
farm. If there are n number of such farms (measured in efficiency units) in an economy, the
aggregate values can be obtained by multiplication of v * and x / by n
aggregate V:, * = nv *

(9)

aggregate Xa = nXj

(10)

At the household level, it has been assumed
that farms are price takers. In aggregate levels,
the prices of outputs and inputs may have to be
appropriately treated in the context of the problem at hand.
Grounded on the microeconomics of production as outlined above, an empirical aggregate
model is developed that simultaneously determines input use and crop production. The model
is specified as follows

FCt = f(PFRt!PR~' AG~' NAR~' CDSt/P~' D)
(11)
(PFRt!PRt)
=

f(PFDJPR~'

HYV,

PFMt!PR~'

D)

(12)

Eq. (3) can be solved for optimal quantities of
variable inputs denoted as x/ as a function of
prices and Z

AGt = f(DPt!PR~' EGt!P~' CDLt!P() D)

(13)

DARt= f{AG() PRt!PO~' D}

(14)

X/

QRt = f(FC~' AG() DAR~' D)

(15)

=Fj(p, q, z)

(4)

R. Ahmed 1Agricultural Economics 12 (1995) 115-128

where FC 1 is consumption of fertilizers (urea,
triple superphosphate, and murate of potash) in
year t (measured in thousands of tons); PFR 0
PFD 0 and PFMr are, respectively, retail, domestic factory gate, and border prices of fertilizer in
year t (measured in TK ton -I; prices are weighted
average of three types of fertilizers); PR 1 is the
wholesale price of rice in year t (TK ton -I); AG 1
is the total irrigated area in year t (thousands of
acres); NARr is the nonirrigated crop area in
year t (acres in thousands); CDS 1 is the shortterm crop loan advanced to farmers from banking
institutions and public agencies in year t (10
million TK); P is the general price index; PD 1 is
the price of diesel fuel in year t (TK ton- 1 ); D is
the dummy variable that takes a value of 0 for
years from 1975 to 1984 and 1 for years from
1985 to 1993; EGr is the public expenditure on
water control and irrigation development in year
t (10 million TK); CDLr is the long-term loan to
farmers from banks and public agencies in year t
(10 million TK); DARt is the dryland rice in year
t (acres in thousands); HYV is the area under
high-yielding varieties of rice (in thousand acres);
P0 1 is the price of mustard oil seeds (TK ton -I)
as proxy for crop prices other than rice.
Rice production is selected as the proxy for
total crop production. Rice contributes about 73%
of GDP in the crop sector; 85% of fertilizers and
95% of irrigated areas in Bangladesh are used for
rice (Chowdhury, 1993).
The following hypotheses are considered very
plausible in the light of evidence from previous
studies (Ahmed, 1978; Stone, 1987; Hossain,
1988):
(a) change in fertilizer consumption
- due to change in real price of fertilizer: negative
- due to change in irrigated area: positive
- due to change in nonirrigated area:
zero or positive
- due to change in volume of crop loan:
positive
(b) change in irrigated area
- due to change in real price of diesel
fuel which is critical for tube-wells and
low-lift pumps: negative

121

- public expenditure on water control
and irrigation: positive or zero
- long-term credit to agriculture: positive
(c) change in retail price of fertilizer
- due to change in domestic factory-gate
price: positive
- due to change in border price (world
price and exchange rate): positive
- due to change in HYV: positive
(d) change in dryland rice area
- due to irrigation expansion: negative
or zero
- due to increase m relative price of
rice, positive
(e) change in rice production
- due to change in fertilizer use: positive
- due to change in irrigated area: positive
- due to change in dryland rice area:
positive
Most of the hypotheses may appear to be quite
obvious and sensible except the effects of (a)
nonirrigated area on fertilizer, (b) public expenditure for water control and irrigation on irrigated
area, and (c) long-term credit to agriculture on
irrigated area. In Bangladesh, fertilizer use in
nonirrigated crops is generally very spotty due to
various risks associated with such land and underdeveloped technology for nonirrigated crops.
In the case of public expenditure for water control and irrigation, the effect is hypothesized to
be either zero or positive mainly for three reasons. First, the bulk of this expenditure is meant
for flood control that does not influence irrigation. Second, the part of this expenditure that
goes for irrigation is meant for large (greater than
2 cusec capacity) tube-wells and surface irrigation
structures. Both these types are known to be
extremely ineffective in getting farmers' participation. Third, public expenditure on irrigation
and actual irrigated areas perhaps bears a lagged
relationship that could not be realistically specified with the information available. Long-term
credit to agriculture in Bangladesh is largely
meant for modern farm equipment. Tube-well
and low-lift pump equipment for irrigation and

122

R. Ahmed/ Agricultural Economics 12 (1995) 115-128

power tillers for cultivation constitute the main
opportunities for such investments in the country's
agriculture.
The most important and relevant hypothesis in
the context of the focus of this analysis is the
effect of the dummy variable, D. The dummy is
designed to capture the complex effects of various changes induced by the liberalization measures on the levels of use of inputs and production. There is no a priori presumption that the
effect of the dummy would be positive or negative, except that the coefficient of the dummy in
Eq. (15) is expected to be not significantly different from zero. This is so because the impact on
production occurs through the impact on the
levels of use of inputs, particularly in the case of
fertilizers, and because the irrigation input is
measured in terms of irrigated area that already
is inclusive of any effect of change in irrigation
techniques. The productivities of these inputs are
not expected to be influenced by the liberalization measures. Shifts in productivity are more a
function of technological change that do not pertain directly to the liberalization measures, at
least within the context of time to which this
analysis is limited. However, a brief reflection on
these complex changes that are likely to be induced by policy liberalization measures and expected to be captured by the dummy is in order.
In the case of fertilizers, the complex changes
induced by liberalization measures that are not
explicitly included as explanatory variables concern real costs of fertilizers to producers and
availability of the input at the right time and
place because of a greatly enhanced competitive
market after privatization, deregulation of market, and decontrol of prices. The price of fertilizer that is included as an explanatory variable
does not include various discounts that the dealers are known to have been providing to purchasers of fertilizers in order to reap quick profits
by increasing business turnovers. Similarly, fertilizer dealers are known to have resorted to sales
on informal credit to their subordinate retailers
and farmers (World Bank, 1992; Chowdhury,
1993). Moreover, increasing the access of fertilizer dealers to factory-gate deliveries, instead of
previously practiced controlled delivery from

BADC stores, must have enhanced the speed and
volume of overall supply in the market. In the
case of irrigation, it was mentioned in Section 2
that the price and supply of low-lift pump and
tube-well engines were suddenly changed (price
decreased and supply increased) by market liberalization, including withdrawal of import restrictions. These price and supply data are not systematically recorded anywhere for their treatment as explanatory variables in the model; hence
the dummy variable is designed to pick up the
effects.
Besides the foregoing hypothesis, three other
considerations bearing upon the specification of
the model need a brief explanation. The first
consideration concerns the selection of 1984/1985
as the splitting point between the post- and preliberalization periods. Although the process of
liberalization had proceeded in a gradual fashion,
certain major and most relevant ones occurred
around 1984. The deregulation and privatization
of the fertilizer market, particularly the decontrol
of prices, were effectively completed by 1984. The
access of dealers to factory gate supply was initiated around that time. Similarly, the deregulation
and privatization of low-lift and tube-well irrigation formally took effect in the years from 1981
through 1986, although the trade restriction on
import of irrigation equipment took effect a few
years later. The second consideration concerns
the fact that HYVs of rice do not appear in any
equation. Analysis of HYV area and irrigation
indicated that the correlation between the
changes in HYV area and changes in irrigated
area was very high (0.91). For this high degree of
multicollinearity between the two variables, the
effect of irrigation has to be viewed as inclusive
of the effect of HYVs. Although fertilizer and
irrigation are also positively correlated, this correlation is not as strong as between irrigation and
HYVs. The third consideration regarding the
specification is that the variable NAG and a few
others have not been endogenized in the model.
The type of information (e.g. relative profitability
in irrigated and nonirrigated crops in a time-series
framework) were not available to endogenize
NAG. Moreover, given the known high profitabil.:
ity of irrigated rice crops, NAG remains primarily

R. Ahmed/ Agricultural Economics 12 (1995) 115-128

a function of weather conditions (rainfall,
drought, etc.). CDS, PD, and COL were not
endogenized partly because they are hardly influenced directly by the input market liberalization,
and partly because such an extension of the model
would ultimately devolve into a general equilibrium framework that is beyond the scope of the
study.
The last consideration relates to the labor
market. No variables on supply and demand for
labor are included in the model. Rural labor
markets are generally not as distorted as urban
labor markets because the distortive labor laws
are inoperative in rural areas. Therefore, it is the
effect of reforms in fertilizer and agricultural
equipment on labor utilization in agricultural
production that remains to be a valid concern.
Moreover, annual data on labor services (as opposed to stock of labor) used in production are
not available to incorporate such variables as
explanatory factors in the equations. In a generally labor surplus economy, such as Bangladesh,
and with a relatively undistorted rural labor market, the exclusion of labor from the model is not
likely to influence the measurement of the contribution of input market reform to production. In
terms of labor's contribution to production in Eq.
(15), the implication is that such a contribution is
mixed with the contribution of land and other
inputs.
With this brief discussion on hypotheses and
model specification, results of estimation are now
presented.

4. Estimation and results

The system of Eqs. (11)-(15) is estimated using
Zellner's Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR)
model. This model is efficient in situations where
the equations are closely interrelated with the
possibility of the error term of one equation
being correlated with the error term of another.
Before using the SUR model, the equations were
estimated using the simple OLS model. The adjusted R 2 values were generally quite high.
The results prove that most of the hypotheses
concerning input use are true. The effects of the

123

dummy variable designed to capture the influence of liberalization on fertilizer consumption
and irrigated area demonstrate that these measures have had a positive and substantial impact.
This positive impact on irrigation and fertilizer in
turn resulted in a positive impact on rice production. These findings belie the arguments by
vested-interest groups that liberalization of agricultural input markets have been counterproductive in Bangladesh.
Fertilizer consumption increased at an annual
rate of 9.0% in the preliberalization period
(1975-1984) compared with the growth rate of
10.04% year- 1 during the postliberalization period. However, the growth in the former period
occurred from a low base of only 450 thousand
tons (see Appendix, Table A2). The consumption
function of fertilizer shows that fertilizer price
relative to rice price, irrigated area, short-term
crop loans, and the complex sets of forces represented by the dummy are the significant explanatory factors for use of fertilizer. Of these factors,
the real price of fertilizer at the retail level increased annually at about 4% in the first period
but decreased annually at about 3% in the second
period. This is primarily because of a fast increase in nominal fertilizer prices during the later
part of the first period. Even though the government attempted to control fertilizer prices during
the preliberalization period, rapidly growing factory-gate prices spurred by increased production
costs, and rising world prices contributed to these
increases in fertilizer prices during the preliberalization period. Once the rise in fertilizer prices
reached a peak by 1984, further growt.h was
slowed by slow growth in factory-gate as well as
world prices in the second period (see Appendix,
Table A2). A slow growth in rice prices in the
second period was of course not low enough to
match the very slow rate of increase in the nominal price of fertilizer, thus resulting in a decline
in the rate of change in the real price of fertilizer
and a positive price effect on fertilizer consumption in this period.
Fertilizer prices at the retail level are found to
be primarily dependent on factory-gate prices
and world prices as hypothesized, the effect of
the former being about four times the effect of

124

R. Ahmed/ Agricultural Economics 12 (1995) 115-128

the latter. However, the difference between retail
and factory-gate prices peaked just around the
time of liberalization but substantially narrowed
in recent years after the liberalization measures
had some time to increase competition and thus
reduce the marketing margin of traders.
The effect of forces underlying the dummy
variable has a significantly positive impact on the
consumption of fertilizers. The value of the
dummy is equal to about 55% of the average
consumption of fertilizer in 1984 and 1985. The
other two significant factors, short-term credit
(CDS) and irrigated area (AG), had opposing
trends between the two periods. Irrigated area
increased at an annual rate of 5.4% in the first
period and 20.49% in the second period. But
short-term credit increased at an annual rate of
28.83% in the first period and declined at a rate
of 7% in the second period.
The higher rate of increase in irrigated area in
the second period is largely attribut.ed to liberalization policies underlying the dummy variable as will be seen from the results presented in
Table 2. Besides the dummy variable, the other
two significant factors are diesel price (PD) and
long-term credit to agriculture (CDL). The negative relation between diesel price and irrigated
area, in conjunction with a faster increase in
diesel price in the first period compared with a
slower increase in the second period, implies a
positive impact of diesel price on irrigated area in
the second period compared with the first. But
long-term credit bears a positive relation to irrigated area. The faster increase in long-term credit
in the first period compared with the rate in the
second period implies that this factor produced a
net depressing effect on the expansion of irrigated area in the second period compared to the
first. The effect of the forces underlying the
dummy variable is reflected in the coefficient of
the dummy. This value is about 130% of the
average irrigated area in 1984 and 1985 and about
33% of the irrigated area in 1992.
The statistically insignificant coefficient of the
dummy variable in Eq. (15) indicates, as hypothesized, that the effect of input market liberalization on the production of rice was realized primarily through the changes in the levels of input

use rather than any technical changes outside the
markets for fertilizer and irrigation inputs. Such
technical changes (e.g. replacement of diesel by
electric engines, use of new rice seeds imported
from India, change in composition of fertilizers)
might have occurred on a small scale but was not
significantly large to create a perceptible impact.
The net effect of the input market reforms,
defined as the difference between the scenarios
with and without reform, is shown in Table 3.
This is estimated by solving the models for

1992/1993. The solution is conducted first by
estimating the irrigated area (AG) from Eq. (13)
with 1992/1993 actual values of exogenous variables and using the value of 0 for D in the case of
the without-reform scenario and the value of 1
for D in the case of the with-reform scenario.
These solutions are then plugged into Eq. (11) for
estimating the levels of FC under two scenarios.
Other exogenous variables in Eq. (11) are assumed to prevail at the actual levels of 1992/1993.
These solutions for AG and FC are then plugged
into Eq. (15) to arrive at production of rice under
the two scenarios. In Table 3, there are, however,
two versions of the without-reform scenarios so
that we have three scenarios in all: (a) with reform, (b) without reform version 1, and (c) without reform version 2. It was clear from the preliminary estimate of the 'without reform' scenario
that the growth in rice production would lag
substantially behind the demand so that
Bangladesh would be reverting back to the status
of a consistent importer. Under this condition,
the acutal 1992/1993 level of rice price that was
assumed in (b) would no longer be valid. Therefore, the scenario (c) was estimated, using the
import parity price rather than the 1992/1993
actual price. The import parity rice price in
1992/1993 was about 19% higher than the actual

125

price; the actual price was slightly above the
export parity price.
The counterfactual results in Table 3 indicate
that the reforms in the fertilizer and irrigation
markets of Bangladesh can be reasonably credited with the remarkable success in rice production. The reform measures contributed to about
20-32% of the increase in production. This increase is primarily attributed to the impact of
reform on fertilizer consumption and private sector irrigation development.
The range of increases in production and input
use shown in Table 3 reflect the differences that
prices of rice under the scenarios of with and
without reform would entail. Version 1 of the
without-reform scenario imposes no change on
consumers' welfare by assuming a price level for
rice which prevailed in 1992/1993. Without reform, as the production slows down or stagnates,
the rice price would rise imposing a welfare loss
to consumers, although inducing some gain in
production and to producers. This is shown in
version 2 of the without-reform scenario. The way
contribution of reform has been defined, limiting
only to production and producers, version 1 credits reform policies with 32% of the increase in
rice production. However, with version 2 that
assumes a welfare loss to consumers via the increase in rice prices, the share of credit to reform
policies drops from 32% to 20%. The basic conclusion that can be drawn from this exercise is
that Bangladesh would have remained immersed
in foodgrain shortages and higher food prices had
there been no changes in the fiscally unsustainable public interventions in agricultural input
markets.

5. Lessons and conclusions
This paper takes a historical perspective to
trace the path of evolution of the contemporary
reforms in agricultural input markets. In the context of Bangladesh, no such study is known to
have been done evaluating the contribution of
reform and deriving lessons therefrom. However,
Osmani and Quasem (1990) conducted a study at
the beginning of market reform, when the debate

126

R. Ahmed 1Agricultural Economics 12 (1995) 115-128

on fertilizer subsidy peaked in Bangladesh. This
study argued in favor of fertilizer subsidy as a
strategic factor for foodgrain self-sufficiency and
asserted that market reform meant to create a
capitalistic mode of production would make the
goal of foodgrain self-sufficiency recede further.
Of course, the literature on macro-economic reform globally, focusing on the general structures
of incentives that such reforms imply, is quite rich
(Schiff and Valdes, 1992; McKinnon, 1993). Studies on sectoral policy reforms on Africa are similarly quite numerous but not always grounded on
systematic case studies (World Bank, 1994). This
paper is expected to contribute to the understanding of the process and the impact of sectoral
policy reforms in one of the poorest countries of
the developing world.
Liberalization of the agricultural input markets of Bangladesh can be credited with the remarkable success in rice production in recent
years. It is estimated that the production of rice
could have been 20-32% lower than the level of
1992/1993, depending on the rice price that
would have prevailed under alternative scenarios.
The 20% credit to market reform relates to a real
rice price level 19% higher than the actual
1992/1993 prices. The 32% credit to reform relates to the actual 1992/1993 price levels. The
lower contribution of reform (20%) to increased
production implies a loss to consumers not accounted in the production benefit of reform while
the higher contribution (32%) of reform entails
no loss to consumers. The bottom-line conclusion
is that Bangladesh, without the market reforms
described in the paper, would have reverted back
to the situation of regular food crisis and high
rice prices, as was the case historically.
Many developing countries are currently attempting to liberalize their input markets. Therefore, the lessons from Bangladesh can have some
usefulness internationally, except, perhaps, former communist countries.
(1) Modern inputs such as fertilizer, power-driven
equipment, HYV seeds, and pesticides are
technologies generally unfamiliar to farmers
at the introductory stage. Initially, markets do
not exist, and public initiative begins with
market creation. This initial period of "market

failure" is quite different from the period
when modern inputs have become reasonably
well known to farmers and market size has
become reasonably adequate for a viable
competitive market. The Bangladesh case
demonstrates that such a stage was possibly
attained by the end of the 1960s in the case of
fertilizers and pesticides and by the end of
the 1970s in the cases of agricultural equipment and seeds. In that sense, the liberalization of input markets could have productively
begun much earlier than it actually happened.
(2) The evolution of the forces that drove public
marketing out of circulation in Bangladesh
provides an interesting lesson. Donor conditionality was definitely a powerful factor. But
that alone does not explain the changes. There
were a number of other compelling factors of
domestic origin. Budgetary burden is one of
them. The rapid changes in removal of subsidies, privatization, and liberalization of import restrictions that have happened in recent
years bear testimony to the political will of a
government to change its mode of agricultural development.
(3) Liberalization of markets at one shot - the
so-called shock therapy approach, and liberalization in phases (the so-called gradual approach) - have been much debated in the
literature as well as in policy circles. If phasing is unavoidable, the question of what sequence should be followed becomes quite relevant. The Bangladesh experience provides a
lesson on this issue. The successful one-shot
approach has rarely been a real-world example, and sequencing of reform measures generally plays a strategic role in liberalization.
One order of sequencing is the introduction of
competitive trading in various layers of the marketing channel from grass-root retailing to wholesaling and thence to the apex involving external
trade, in a stage-by-stage fashion. There is merit
in this approach. Generally, the public-sector efficiency improves as it withdraws from retail to
wholesale and thence to the apex; it loses efficiency as it extends from the apex level to the
wholesale and thence to the retail links of the
marketing channel. Contrary to this experience,

R. Ahmed 1Agricultural Economics 12 (1995) 115-128

the degree of competition in private trade generally diminishes as one moves from retail to wholesale to the apex. The relative strength and weakness of the public and private sectors in marketing imply that the best strategy of sequencing is
the privatization of the retail market first and
then a gradual move up to the apex level. This is
the sequence followed in the input markets of
Bangladesh.
(4) Another order of sequencing would be a
gradual geographical coverage of markets by
reform measures, as was done in the case of
privatization and price decontrol of fertilizers
in Bangladesh. This is generally done to avoid
a risky failure at the beginning. A countrywide privatization and liberalization may occasionally create turmoil and unforeseen side
effects that a weak administration may not be
able to handle. When no side effects are
observed, a quick extension to all regions can
be made. This gradual geographical coverage
is an option for consideration only when the
risk of failure is very high and a vested interest is perceived to be working to demonstrate
a failure. When a gradual regional coverage is
adopted, it is desirable to begin with the
region that has a relatively strong basis in
terms of demand for the input in question.
(5) Complementary support to the principal program of liberalization is almost always a critical factor for success. Monitoring of changes
in supply, demand, prices, and emerging situations is essential. Without a well-thought-out
support plan, the liberalization process has
often been found to falter. In the case of
fertilizer in Bangladesh, the monitoring role
of IFDC has been a profound factor in the
success of liberalization.
