Abstract
Many mechanized crop producers and agribusinesses are fascinated with precision agriculture technology, but adoption
has lagged behind the expectations. Among the reasons for slow adoption of precision agriculture technology is that initial
users focused excessively on in-field benefits from variable-rate fertilizer application using regional average fertilizer recommendations. This article illustrates how greater use of site-specific crop response information can improve variable rate input
application recommendations.
Precision agriculture is spatial information technology applied to agriculture. The technologies include global position
systems (GPS), geographic information systems (GIS), yield monitoring sensors, and computer controlled within-field variable
rate application (VRA) equipment. Experimentation with these technologies is occurring everywhere there is large scale
mechanized agriculture. Commercial use has been greatest in the US, where 43% of farm retailers offered VRA services in
2001. Except for certain high-value crops like sugar beet, farmer adoption ofVRA has been modest. The farm level profitability
of VRA continues to be questionable for bulk commodity crops.
The theoretical model and illustration presented here suggest that VRA fertilization has not yet reached its profitability
potential. Most VRA field trials to date have relied upon existing state-wide or regional input rate recommendations. Unobserved soil characteristics can potentially interact with an input to make its effect on yield vary site-specifically within fields.
Failure to use site-specific response functions for VRA applications may lead to a misallocation of inputs just as great as that
which results from using uniform applications instead of VRA.
Agricultural economists have a long history of estimating output response to input applications. Several have started to
develop tools to estimate site-specific responses from yield monitor and other precision agriculture data. Likewise, agricultural
economists have developed an important body of research results on information value based on managing variabilitytypically in temporal settings. With these tools, a major potential exists to develop further benefits from precision agriculture
technologies that permit truly spatially tailored input applications.

1. Introduction

2. Background and hypothesis

Global positioning systems (GPS) and sensors are
turning the data-poor agricultural production sector
into a data-rich environment. Farmers have always
known that crop yields vary spatially. But until the
early 1990s the technology of commercial farm
equipment did not permit much in the way of spatial management, and gathering data on spatial variability of yields or farm land characteristics for the
purpose of fine-tuning management was too expensive. Because of this expense, generation of detailed
crop production data was limited to small plot trials, mainly on experiment stations. One-size-fits-all
extension recommendations based on these small
plots were extrapolated over large areas. But in the
1990s, the civilian use of GPS and availability of low
cost computers made spatially-related management
technologically feasible, and created an explosion of
agricultural data with locational attributes.
It will be argued in this paper that the way in which
crop input application recommendations are developed has not caught up with the technological progress
that has made spatial management technologically
feasible. Thus, at this point in time there remains a
disconnection between the regional-scale recommendations for input management put out by extension
services, and the detailed spatial data that are now inexpensively recoverable with the newest technologies.
This disconnection raises important questions about
whether more spatially tailored input recommendations could add value for crop producers. The purpose
of this article is to raise these questions explicitly,
and to begin to address them. In particular, this paper
aims: (1) to summarize economic research on variable rate input use, including diagnosis of adoption
constraints; (2) to restate the crop production economics problem in spatial terms; and (3) to illustrate
how incorporating site characteristics into variable
rate application (VRA) fertilization recommendations
can make variable rate farming more' profitable and
spatial field data more valuable. Accomplishing these
objectives leads to the conclusion that the way in
which agronomists and agricultural economists recommend input application rates to farmers should
change radically to make better use of spatial input
management technology in both production and data
collection.

Use of GPS, geographical information systems
(GIS), electronic sensors and other spatial information technology in farming is often labeled "precision
agriculture." Though the technology has wide implications for marketing, risk management, logistics and
other whole farm information system issues (Swinton
and Lowenberg-DeBoer, 1998), its initial use has been
on intrafield management of crop inputs by varying
application rates within fields. Experimentation with
precision agriculture technology is occurring throughout the world wherever farming is mechanized. The
technology is being used commercially in the US,
Canada, Argentina, Brazil, South Africa and in most
western European countries (Norton and Swinton,
2002; Swinton and Lowenberg-DeBoer, 2001). (A
fuller description of precision agriculture technology
and potential uses can be found in Lowenberg-DeBoer
and Erickson (2000) and Morgan and Ess (1997).)
The crop GIS has many layers. From an economic
perspective, the yield layer is the integrator of all the
factors that influence crop growth, but many factors
and their interactions influence that yield. Much of the
early interest in spatial crop growth variability came
from soil scientists. The soils layers include soil test
results on macro- and micronutrients, organic matter level and soil physical characteristics. One of the
first observations from yield maps was that production seemed closely linked to water availability and
movement. This triggered an interest in topography,
micro-climates and drainage layers. Since the 1970s,
there have been attempts to use remote sensing images in crop production. Including aerial and satellite
images in a crop GIS potentially provides low cost
information on crop growth and plant population.
Spatial management of seasonal inputs is made
possible by VRA controllers. These controllers can
modify rate of input flow or switch input source (e.g.
between seed or fertilizer types) in response to computer signals as farm equipment moves through a
field. VRA equipment makes it possible to implement site-specific input control in response to GIS
records of input needs and GPS location data. This
site-specific control of inputs has two possible benefits. First, it allows farmers to tailor their input
application rates to the varying yield response characteristics in different parts of a field. Second, it allows

D.S. Bullock et al.! Agricultural Economics 27 (2002) 233-245

for inexpensive gathering of site-specific data, which
can provide the farmer desiring to farm using VRA
with valuable information.
In Section 3, a literature review is presented to argue that economic performance of VRA in general has
been poor. A variety of economic and technical reasons are presented to explain why most VRA has been
implemented with an estimate of input needs based on
whole field information. This observation leads to the
key hypothesis, illustrated in Section 5 using the theoretical framework developed in Section 4, which is
that the poor economic performance of VRA has come
about chiefly because information on the spatial variability of crop response has not been used sufficiently
in developing input recommendations (Swinton and
Lowenberg-DeBoer, 1998).

3. Economic research on adoption of VRA
In 2001, about 46% of all farm retailers m the
US offered some type of intensive soil sampling services, most commonly on a 1 ha (2.5 acre) grid basis (Whipker and Akridge, 2001). About one-third of
US retailers offered some type of computer-controlled
fertilizer VRA in the 2001 crop season. In the Midwest, almost 43% of retailers offered VRA in 2001.
Computer-controlled VRA services in the US were
introduced in the late 1980s, and grew rapidly in the
1990s, but sales have been flat since 1999.
For some higher value specialty crops, like sugar
beets, usage of variable rate nutrient spreading is quite
high. Grower surveys indicate that in 1996 about 25%
of the beet acres in the Red River Valley of North
Dakota and Minnesota were grid soil sampled and had
nitrogen applied at a variable rate. In 1999, variable
rate nitrogen was used on about 40% of the sugar beet
acreage in the two states (Franzen, 2000).
For bulk commodities (e.g. corn, soybeans and
wheat), the rate of intensive soil sampling and variable rate application has been substantially lower than
dealer service offerings would indicate. Khanna et al.
(1999) showed that about 14% of farmers in Illinois,
Iowa, Indiana and Wisconsin used some GPS soil
sampling in 1997 and about 12% some variable rate
fertilizer in 1997. USDA data from 1998 show that
nation-wide in the US, about 2% of all farms were
using grid soil sampling or VRA (Daberkow and

235

McBride, 2000), but adoption was higher for grain
and oilseed producers. The 1998 USDA data shows
that 7% of grain and oilseed producers used grid soil
sampling and 6% used VRA. A 1999 Ohio survey
showed that about 8% of farmers had done some GPS
soil sampling and about 7% some VRA of fertilizer
or lime (Batte, 2001).
Many US producers of bulk commodities (corn,
soybeans and wheat) are fascinated by the idea of
site-specific management of soil fertility. It is an intuitively appealing concept, but has been plagued by
continued questions about the profitability of the practice. The response of many growers has been to enroll part of their acreage in one of the site-specific
soil management programs offered by fertilizer retailers. For many farmers this is a low cost way to learn
about precision farming without long-term investment
in equipment.
In western Europe, Latin America and Australia
there is experimentation with VRA, but relatively little commercial use (Norton and Swinton, 2002). In
Latin America and Australia the high cost of soil sampling limits the intensive soil sampling that is currently the basis of VRA decisions. In western Europe
VRA seems to be driven mainly by environmental concern and regulation. In a 1997 mail survey of 90 crop
farmers in Great Britain, Fountas (1998) found that
7% used VRA and 12% used spatially referenced soil
sampling and mapping.
Use of variable rate planting and variable rate pesticide application is more scattered than is use of variable rate fertilizer application. Khanna et al. (1999)
found that in 1997 about 2.1% of farmers in Illinois,
Iowa, Wisconsin and Indiana practiced variable rate
pesticide application, and about 1% did variable rate
seeding. Daberkow and McBride (2000) show that
about 1.7% of US producers used variable rate pesticide application in 1998, and the use of variable rate
seeding was less than 1% of farmers.
3.1. VRA profitability in field trials
The data cited above indicate that while for some
higher value crops, VRA seems to have been adopted
on a systematic and wide scale, for the great majority
of crops, VRA adoption rates remain quite low. An
obvious candidate to explain low adoption rates is the
possibility that profit rates from VRA are low. Most

236

economic studies of precision agriculture technology
have focused on VRA of fertilizer because that was
the first technology to be commercialized and it was
also the one on which the most data was available
for economic analysis. The published results on profitability of VR nutrient applications can be difficult
to interpret, due to differences in experimental design
and assumptions about included costs. Lambert and
Lowenberg-DeBoer (2000) reviewed 108 studies of
precision agricultural profitability. Some 63% report
profits, but many of those omit important costs, make
unrealistic yield advantage estimates, or use simulation methods that may underestimate non-treatment
effects. Partial budgets on VR fertilizer application are
driven by three elements: (1) increased cost of soil
sampling information and VRA; (2) change in cost of
fertilizer applied; and (3) change in revenue due to
crop yield. The added information cost is central, yet
it is omitted from some studies.
Swinton and Lowenberg-DeBoer (1998) examined
profitability results from nine university field research
studies of VRA fertilization (Table 1). They applied
standard minimum cost assumptions to all studies
where selected cost items had been omitted. They
found that the value of crop yield gains was especially important. High-value crops that responded to
VRA of fertilizer tended to do so more profitably than
low-value crops, because the yield gains were worth
more. VRA of fertilizer on wheat and barley was
nowhere profitable, the results for corn were mixed,
and VRA fertilizer on sugar beet was profitable. By
contrast, cost savings from reduced fertilizer application were much less important. The fertilizer inputs
being managed are fairly low cost and only one study
managed more than two of them. Given that soil
testing is fairly costly, most of the crops are of fairly
low value, and macronutrient fertilizers are relatively
cheap, the cost of over-fertilizing is fairly low.
3.2. VRA profitability in simulation studies
There is a similar group of studies using crop growth
simulation to evaluate site-specific soil nutrient management. Lowenberg-DeBoer and Swinton (1997)
review the simulation studies through 1997. Simulation studies that have appeared after 1997 include:
Thirkawala et al. (1999), Babcock and Pautsch
(1998) and English et al. (1999). Like field studies,

the simulation studies give mixed profitability results
for VRA fertilization, but they are more likely to show
VRA profitability because they do not always include
other yield limiting factors. For example, intensive soil
sampling may show areas of low phosphorus in a field.
Simulation may suggest a yield increase with VRA of
phosphorus. The reality may be that these are areas in
which water holding capacity is the most limiting factor and increasing phosphorous has little yield benefit.
3.3. Other VRA input technologies
Scattered studies have dealt with the economics of
VRA of inputs other than fertilizer. In on-farm experiments Barnhisel et al. (1996) showed that variable
rate plant populations can be profitable in the Kentucky karst landscape, which are characterized by wide
variation in yield potential. Lowenberg-DeBoer (1998)
showed when management zones are determined by
yield potential, variable rate seeding for corn is profitable only when some parts of the field have potentials
below 6.3 Mg/ha. Bullock et al. (1998) analyzed small
plot data from 1987 to 1996 and found that there may
be small yield gains when plant population is varied
by soil type, but the cost of determining optimal plant
population by soil type probably exceeds the benefit
in most cases. Bongiovanni and Lowenberg-DeBoer
(2000a) used a simulation model to analyze the profit
potential of VRA of lime in Indiana. They found that
VRA of lime was profitable under a wide range of
circumstances, largely due to the fact that the optimal
pH range is relatively narrow and there are negative
effects of over-liming (e.g. micronutrient tie up, increased damage from certain soil applied herbicides).
3.4. Integrated VRA systems
In principle, precision management of multiple inputs can provide greater profitability than managing
each input separately for two reasons. First, interactions between inputs can be fine-tuned. Second, data
collection, analysis and implementation steps can be
combined for some inputs. The interaction of the right
corn hybrid at the best population for that hybrid with
the profit maximizing nitrogen rate for that hybrid
and population, can yield better and may be more
profitable than if each input were optimized separately. One example of combining steps occurs in soil

sampling. The labor required to do grid soil sampling
is the same whether that sample is tested for only
pH, or also tested for phosphorus, potassium, cation
exchange capacity (CEC), and other characteristics.
VRA costs will be lower if soil sampling costs can be
spread over multiple inputs.
There are no truly integrated precision farming systems, but evidence from the Sauder farm trials (Finck,
1998) provides support for the idea that systems that
manage multiple inputs are more profitable. These
trials integrated variable rate management of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium with planting rate on
a 526 ha farm producing a balanced corn-soybean rotation in central Illinois. (The experimentation "cost"
was treated as a sunk cost at the time when the Sauder
VRT trials where conducted.) Over 3 years the average benefit from the GPS-based management for both
corn and soybeans was US$ 34.35/ha. The experimental design did not allow researchers to identify
which parts of the system contributed most to the
benefit, but it was clear that a 0.9 Mg/ha increase in
average corn yields played an important role. This is
one of the only studies that have shown a statistically
significant impact of site-specific management on
yields.
In addition to being more integrated, the Sauder
farm trials differed from virtually all other precision
farming research in that the producer had conducted
on-farm research to determine optimal nitrogen rates
and corn plant populations on his soils and his management before starting VRA. A key hypothesis is
that the impressive agronomic and economic performance in the Sauder trials is linked in part to use of
site-specific response information, instead of relying
on regional recommendations.

4. A model of spatial profit optimization
Unlike the Sauder farm, contemporary VRA fertilization in the US usually works from recommendations that are based on regional average crop growth.
Given the ability to gather spatial agronomic data and
apply inputs spatially with VRA, the challenge is to
decide how much of each input to apply in order to
meet the objective of maximizing the decision maker's
satisfaction, which we will proxy here with the profit
function n(· ). To make explicit the issues at hand,

a theoretical model of spatial profit optimization is
presented.
For a crop producer it is assumed that nO is increasing in crop yield and that crop yield./(-) can be
described as a function of managed variable inputs (x ),
unmanageable stochastic inputs (z-notably weather),
and unmanageable but non-stochastic site characteristics (c). The site characteristics argument distinguishes
this spatially manageable yield function (Bullock
et al., 1998; Bullock and Bullock, 2000) from those
previously used to develop input recommendations
(Heady and Dillon, 1961; Dillon and Anderson, 1990).
Agronomic research has tended to find that plant
nutrients increase crop yield up to some maximum
level beyond which they may plateau or decline.
Where pests are present, this pattern is also true of
damage-control inputs like pesticides. So it is reasonable to expectj(x, z, c) to be locally concave at economic levels of x, though it may have an increasing
marginal product and be locally convex at low levels of x. Second, the arguments of the yield function
typically interact (e.g. fertilizer, soil characteristics
and rainfall), so the yield function is non-separable in
these traits, especially x and c.
Using a variant of the classic profit maximization problem adapted to spatial management by
Lowenberg-DeBoer and Boehlje (1997) and Bullock
and Bullock (2000), the basic spatial management
optimization problem can be written as:
n

(1)

where p is output price, w is a vector of input prices, y
is yield, xis a vector of managed inputs, c is a vector of
site characteristics, and z is a vector of uncontrollable
factors that are variable by site. The last three terms in
the objective function are costs: g are quasi-fixed costs
for data collection and management, v are quasi-fixed
costs for VRA technology, and F are other fixed costs.
Subscripts i and j index variables to rectangular cells
in a Cartesian plane, where i is the latitude of a cell's
center, and j is the longitude. Weather variables z are
assumed not to vary within the farmer's field, and
therefore do not carry the spatial subscripts i, j.
Central to developing the decision tool is the empirical task of finding parameters for manageable inputs

D.S. Bullock et at. I Agricultural Economics 27 (2002) 233-245

in the yield function Yi, J = f( x; ,J. c;,J,Z). The most
common approach to parameterizing a yield function
is statistical estimation. Field data are required that
include variability in all of the variables serving as arguments in the yield function. Unfortunately, in many
cases the field characteristic variables c;,J may be
non-observable. In this case it is not possible to estimate the "meta" yield response function f{x, c, z).
However, it may still be possible, without observing
c;,J, to estimate a "site-specific" yield response function J; ,J (x; ,J, z)= f (x; ,J , c; ,z, z) for a small piece of
land. This implies conducting on-farm experiments
to estimate site-specific yield response function s. Locally, site-specific yield response functions can embody fixed effects that explicity model the activity
of site characteristic variables omitted from previous
recommendations. Omitting any relevant variable may
introduce bias if there exists correlation between included and omitted variables (Griliches, 1957; Greene,
1990, p. 259).
The existing research base for agronomic input recommendations was developed long before spatial data
management technologies came into being. The consequences may partially explain the findings that VRA
input management tends to be unprofitable on US
field crops (Swinton and Lowenberg-DeBoer, 1998).
The following section illustrates how omission of relevant site characteristic variables can influence parameter estimates as well as the value of site sampling
information.

5. An illustration of information value from
spatial crop yield response data
A heuristic simulation was developed to illustrate
the difference in the profitability of VRA technology
used under regional yield response information versus VRA technology used with site-specific yield response information. Consider a farm composed of one
square field divided into a grid of (41 x 41) = 1681 ha.
The agronomic characteristics of each grid cell are homogenous, but vary across cells. Crop yield (y) is a
function f of three variables only: applied nitrogen fertilizer (x), soil nitrogen (c 1), and soil depth (cz) ,which
is unobservable. Soil nitrogen c 1 ranges between 3
and 82 kg/ha, while soil depth cz ranges between 1
and 82 em. The spatial distribution of soil nitrogen,

assumed that no unmanageable stochastic variables z
affect yield. Eq. (2) presents the assumed form of the
yield response function:

50. The figure illustrates how the functional form in
Eq. (2) implies that deeper soil leads to a higher and
steeper yield response to total nitrogen .
The 1681 ha in the field are indexed by (i, j), where
i , j = 1, ... , 41 , such that hectare (i, j) is the ith
hectare to the east of the western border of the field ,
and the jth hectare to the north of the southern border.

in the field has it's "own" yield response to total nitrogen, /i,J (x, C]i,J ). The yield response of hectare (i,
j) depends on the parameters ai,J, f3i,J, and Yi,J. The
producer is assumed to be able to sample the value
of soil-borne nitrogen C]i,J in each hectare (i, }), but
since variable C2 is unobservable, it is not possible for
the producer to estimate the yield response function
in Eq. (2) directly. However, the producer can run (or
hire a consultant to run) agronomic experiments that
provide data with which to estimate the coefficients
in Eq. (3) for every (i, j) for which an experiment
is run.
Six scenarios illustrate how different levels of
on-farm experimentation can be used to estimate the
coefficients of the yield response functions in different parts of the field. For simplicity, it is initially
assumed that this information can be obtained at no
additional cost.

mates of any cell's yield response function parameters would not be perfectly accurate because of the
effects of unobserved variables and measurement

information.)
• Partial information scenarios: agronomic experiments are run only on a grid sample of the 1681 ha
in the field. Sampling densities include 441, 121,
81, 36 and 25 ha, as shown in Fig. 3b-f, generating
perfect knowledge of ai,J and f3i,J for the hectares
on which experiments were run. This information
is then spatially interpolated (kriged), to estimate
the ai,J and f3i,J in each of the remaining squares.
In the simulation, the kriged estimates, called aL
and f3L (i, j = 1, ... , 41; k is the sampling density) were based upon a fitted exponential semivariogram using the Geostatistics for the Environmental Sciences software package (Gamma Design
Software).
The information set for each sampling density k is
denoted ISk = {a},], f3L,

estimate of the individual yield response function for

The producer's profit maximization problem can be
restated from Eq. (1), depending on his or her information set and the availability of either variable rate
fertilizer application technology (VRA) or uniform
rate application (URA). A farmer who has VRA is assumed to choose a nitrogen rate on every hectare so
as to maximize net revenues:

A farmer who must use URA is assumed to choose

and w = US$ 0.33/kg (i.e. US$ 0.15/lb), and for the
moment g and v (information and VRA costs) are assumed to be 0, while other fixed costs (F) are irrelevant to the decision.

(8)

Substituting (7) and (8) into the objective functions
in (5) and (6) gives the producer's gross margins over
applied nitrogen costs for all six information scenarios, for VRA and URA, respectively. The results are
summarized in Fig. 4.
Two important results are evident in Fig. 4. First,
given any amount of costless information available,
the gross margin over the applied nitrogen costs are
higher under VRA than under URA. The difference
between these two shows the maximum amount that
the farmer would be willing to pay to use VRA instead
of URA. For every amount of information shown in
Fig. 4 (i.e. to know with certainty the yield response
functions for 25, 36, 81, 121, 441, and 1681 of the
cells), the farmer is willing to pay a premium for VRA.
Second, the value of VRA versus URA increases
with the amount of information that the farmer possesses. More information about site-specific yield
response makes VRA worth more. Fig. 4 reports
the result that given information set IS25, the farmer
would be willing to pay US$ 1.60/ha for VRA. But

The solutions to the maximization problems in (6)
are the economically optimal input application rates

from 441 to 1681. But it actually decreases slightly between 25 and
36 units of information. This latter result has been made possible
by the way in which we have defined "quantity of information"
in this heuristic example. As can bee seen in Figs. 3e and f,
information not only about more cells, but about different cells
are drawn from when 36 experiments are run instead of 25.
Had we decided to get information from 36 cells by first using
the information obtained from the original 25 and then adding
information from 11 more cells, the result would have been that
the gross margin over applied nitrogen costs would have increased
slightly when the number of experiments run went from 25 to 36.

with more information, this willingness-to-pay for
VRA increases, up to US$ 7.30/ha when the farmer
possesses full information (i.e. has information set
IS168l ). This implies that the marginal value of information is positive when the farmer possesses VRA.
But in the example, the marginal value of information
to the farmer using URA is basically zero-using
URA, the farmer can make nearly as much money with
IS2s as he can with complete information (IS16s1). 3
So, VRA makes information worth more. These
results come about because variable rate technology and information are economic complements for
the farmer. Having more information shifts demand
(willingness-to-pay) for variable rate technology out,
and having variable rate technology available shifts
demand (willingness-to-pay) for information out.
The intuition behind these results is straightforward.
Farmers who farm using URA have to choose one
nitrogen application rate for their entire field. The optimal nitrogen application rate under URA will be too
high for some parts of the field and too low for other
parts, but on average, it will be profit-maximizing.
Roughly speaking, the farming using URA wants to
know the shape of the "average" of the yield response
curves. To get reasonably good estimates of the coefficients of the "average" yield response curve does
not take much information; a sample of the true yield
response coefficients from 25 cells evenly-spaced
throughout the field is large enough to give a very
close estimate of the field's "average" yield response
curve, which the farmer could know perfectly if he or
she sampled the entire population of 1681 cells. Thus,
agronomic experiments on just 25 of the 1681 ha of
the field provided virtually all the information the
URA farmer could use. But a farmer using VRA had
use for more information, because he or she could
use information about how the yield response curve
coefficients in Eq. (3) are spatially distributed. The
farmer using VRA wants to know more than the
shape of the "average" response curve; he or she
benefits from knowing the shapes of every response
curve. Learning about the entire distribution of the
3 Based on the assumption of a single yield response function,
Schnitkey et al. (1996) have shown that use of an economic
decision rule to determine the URA input rate with site-specific
sampling (e.g., of CJ) results in a different (more profitable) rate
than one that is based upon whole-field average soil sampling.

243

1681 response curves takes much more information
than simply finding a good estimation of the mean
response. Therefore, farming under VRA is much
more information intensive than farming under URA.

6. Conclusions
Producers and agribusinesses remain fascinated
with precision agriculture technology. Adoption, however, has lagged behind the expectations of many pundits. There are many good reasons for slow adoption
of precision agriculture technology, not least of which
is that researchers and farmers have initially focused
excessively on in-field benefits from variable-rate fertilizer application derived when regional average fertilizer recommendations are used. This initial failure
of focus is understandable; these regional average fertilizer recommendations have been used for decades
with conventional application technology, and it was
natural to use them initially to manage variable rate
application. But our research suggests that because
VRA technology has increased the value that can be
added from site-specific data, new methods of developing application rate recommendations are needed.
The increased demand for site-specific information brought about by the appearance of precision
technology calls for increased supply of site-specific
information. Several researchers have begun trying
to estimate site-specific response functions. Malzer
et al. (1997) is an early published report of estimates
of site-specific yield response functions. Bongiovanni
and Lowenberg-DeBoer (2000b) obtained data from
Argentine on-farm trials with combine yield monitors
sensors, to develop corn nitrogen recommendations
that incorporated slope position via spatial econometric techniques. Hurley et al. (2001) used a geostatistical approach to model omitted site variables and
spatial error correlation in corn response to nitrogen.
Swinton et al. (2002) developed topographic indices
for wetness and insulation potential from Michigan
on-farm trial data to estimate site-specific nitrogen
response functions. But work in this area is only
beginning.
Our research shows that the presence of VRA technology makes site-specific information worth more.
This implies that two new forms of agronomic yield
response research are now called for. First, more in-

244

D.S. Bullock et aUAgricultural Economics 27 (2002) 233-245

formation about the meta-response function f(x, c, z)
needs to be gathered. This can be done through more
long-term region-wide agronomic experimentation
that systematically varies input levels to study their
interaction with site-characteristics and stochastic
variables over time.
The second type of research called for is that which
will enable farmers to measure the site-specific characteristics c of their fields cheaply and accurately. For
even if the meta-response function is known, farmers
need to improve their estimates of Ci,j for each site
(i, j) if they are to possess the site-specific response
functions f(x, Ci,j, z) on their farms. Agricultural engineering research into finding inexpensive ways to
develop maps of the site-specific characteristic levels
Ci,j on farms is currently well under way. Examples
range from research into "on-the-fly" nitrogen stress
sensors to research on the measurement of soil electroconductivity.
VRA technology may soon make it feasible for a
farmer to use on-farm agronomic experimentation to
bypass the challenge of estimating the meta-response
function f(x, c, z) and finding inexpensive ways to
map the c variables. Through on-farm agronomic experimentation, it is possible to estimate a site-specific
yield response function !i,j (x, z)= f (x, Ci,j, z) without needing to know the meta-response functionf(x, c,
z) or obtaining a map of the farm's site-specific characteristics Ci,j. It is a fascinating fact that while precision
technology has increased the demand for site-specific
information, it also has great potential to increase
the supply of site-specific information. For precision
technology can greatly reduce the cost of running
agronomic experiments. Software for VRA equipment
and yield monitors is now being developed to automate much of the running of agronomic experiments.
Combining such on-farm experimental data with a
time series of weather data will enable estimation
of site-specific yield response functions fi,j(X, z) =
f(x, Ci,j, z). Agricultural economists have a long history of estimating output response to input applications. Likewise, agricultural economists have developed an important body of research results on information value, based on managing variability-typically
in temporal settings. With these tools, there exists major potential to develop further benefits from precision
agriculture technologies, including the estimation of
site-specific response relationships that permit truly

spatially tailored input applications and create added
value for site-specific information.
