ABSTRACT
Strauss, J., Barbosa, M., Teixeira, S., Thomas, D. and Junior, R.G., 1991. Role of education
and extension in the adoption of technology: a study of upland rice and soybean farmers
in Central-West Brazil. Agric. Econ., 5: 341-359.
This paper explores reduced form determinants of the adoption of certain technologies by
upland rice and soybean farmers in the Center-West region of Brazil. We merge community
level data on the availability and quality of publicly provided infrastructure, principally
extension, to the farm level data containing information on farmer human capital as well as
land quantity and quality. By using community level measures of availability and quality of
extension, we avoid problems of endogeneity of farm level measures of extension use. We
find positive impacts of farmer education on the diffusion process, in accordance with other
studies. We also isolate effects of the quality in regional extension investment as measured by
the average experience of technical extension staff. These results indicate that investments in
human capital of extension workers does have a payoff in terms of farmer adoption of
improved cultivation practices.

1. INTRODUCTION

Since 1974 the Brazilian government has invested considerable resources
in agricultural research. The knowledge which has been accumulated, and
the technologies which are available, have been adopted by farmers only
with a considerable lag. Furthermore, this lag is not the same for all
products, for all farmers, for all communities or for all regions.
Several factors, including structural transformations in the Brazilian econ0169-5150/91/$03.50

omy and different agricultural policies, probably contribute to this gap in
technology adoption. We focus in this paper on two factors which are
important from a public policy point of view: the education of the farmer,
and the availability and quality of extension services. Education has been
widely discussed as an important determinant of production efficiency and
technology diffusion (e.g., Welch, 1970; Jamison and Lau, 1982; Feder et al.,
1985). There are fewer studies of the impact of extension [see Birkhauser et
al. (1991) for a survey and Patrick and Kehrberg (1973) for a study of
Brazilian agriculture]; many of these studies have failed to account for the
fact that measures of farm level extension contacts should be treated as
endogenous and even fewer explicitly account for the quality of extension
services. We address both issues.
Heterogeneity in the regional composition of agriculture within Brazil has
been explained, in part, by the availability of technology for different crops
(Homem de Melo, 1983). We will examine the adoption of a series of
technologies by rice and soybean farmers in Goias, Matto Grosso and Matto
Grosso do Sul, the three states in the Brazilian Center-West. Since the late
1970s, this region has been a large contributer to agricultural production in
Brazil and, at present, the Center-West accounts for about a third of the
total national area planted with rice, over a quarter of the area planted with
soybeans and nearly a fifth of the land planted with rice, soybeans, beans,
com and wheat taken together. Regional yields are higher than the Brazilian
averages for soybeans, com, cassava, cotton and sugar cane; they are lower
for wheat and rice, but this is because the all-Brazil average includes
irrigated land of which there is little in the Center-West.
There have been substantial changes in the allocation of land to different
crops over the last two decades in Brazil. Perhaps one of the most dramatic,
and important, events in this process of change is the sixfold increase of the
area planted with soybeans in the Center-West over the last decade. Upland
rice, which is a traditional crop in this area, 1 tends to be cultivated by
farmers who recently migrated to the Center-West. The area planted with
rice rose substantially from 1970/71 through to the end of that decade and
has continued to rise since 1985/6 when it pulled out of a stagnant period
during the early 1980s (Teixeira, 1987).
Using data collected by the Centro Nacional de Pesquisa de Arroz e
Feijao (CNPAF) in 1985/86, we will study the determinants of the adoption
of a series of technologies and cultural practices by upland rice and soybean
farmers. Both soybeans and upland rice technologies began to be introduced

pasture.

in the region after 1980. Since no retrospective information was collected in
the survey, we are unable to model the dynamics of the diffusion process.
We therefore study how the adoption and extent of adoption, of a set of
practices at one point in time are affected by farm and farmer characteristics, together with the availability and quality of publicly provided infrastructure.
We find, as in other studies, that farmer's education positively affects the
adoption of new technology. We isolate effects of the quality of regional
extension investment as measured by the average experience of technical
extension staff. These results, which are new to the agriculture diffusion
literature, indicate that investments in human capital of extension workers
does have a payoff in terms of the adoption of better cultivation practices by
farmers.
2. METHODOLOGY

We view the adoption of technology as an economic decision based on
discounted expected marginal benefits and costs. The empirical specification
used in this paper is consistent with a variety of models of farmer or farm
household optimization: maximizing expected profits, expected utility of
profits or expected utility of consumption and leisure subject to production
function and time constraints (see Roe and Graham-Tomasi, 1986). For
convenience in exposition, let us take the first alternative. Discounted
expected profits, V( · ), will be composed of two parts: the difference in
discounted expected value of production of all crops and livestock with and
without adoption of the particular technology, minus the difference in costs.
We can think of this as the difference of two profit functions, each of which
is a function of the base year constraints and information of farmers. The
constraint and information sets include four components; two at the farm
level and two at the community levels. At the farm level we view as
constraints, firstly, human capital factors associated with the farm decision
making process and, secondly, wealth factors including the quantity and
quality of land owned. We view land cultivated (which includes land owned)
and other quasi-fixed factors, such as machinery, as adjustable over the time
horizon of the farmer, and therefore do not include them as exogenous or
pre-determined covariates. At the community level, the information set
includes the level of farm services, especially extension and input marketing
services; and agro-climate factors related to yield levels and instability.
Two types of human capital, education and experience, are plausibly
related to technology adoption. All else equal, both should be positively
related to information available to the farmer. Experience may provide
general farming knowledge as well as specific knowledge about his or her

344

J_ STRAUSS ET AL

particular farm, while education may enable the farmer to better process the
information provided by different sources, and may increase both the
allocative and technical efficiency of the farmer (Jamison and Lau, 1982).
We assume all farming decisions are made by the household head and use
his (or her) years of education as our measure of education, his age as a
measure of general farming experience, and the number of years he has lived
in the region as a measure of more region-specific experience. We would
prefer to use the amount of time the farmer has been farming in the area;
unfortunately this information is not available. It would also be useful to
distinguish different types of education (such as technical and non-technical
schools) but this information was not collected.
Since much land is rented, the amount of land cultivated is an input over
which farmers have choice, even in the short run, and so it does not belong
in a reduced form model. We include, therefore, the amount of land owned
by the farmer, which is an indicator of wealth. One may argue that, in the
long run, land sales are possible; we take a more medium run perspective
here, while recognizing that larger farms may result from better managerial
ability. The survey provides us with two types of variables relating to farm
level land quality; the topography of the land (before any leveling or
terracing is undertaken) and the degree of soil erosion. Both are somewhat
crude measures; it might have been useful to have more precise data [see for
instance Sidhu and Baanante (1981) or Bhalla (1988) for examples of input
demand and yield analyses which indicate the usefulness of good land
quality data].
Previous studies of farm technology adoption have used similar specifications; farmer education is almost always included, although experience
measures other than age are seldom available; sometimes land quality data
are also included. It is unusual, however, to find studies that use community
level variables other than prices. We would argue, however, that the availability and quality of extension input provision and marketing services
probably influence the adoption process, as do agro-climatic variables such
as rainfall distribution [see Birkhauser et al. (1991) for a survey of the
extension impact literature]. We take two approaches to modeling community influences.
We first include rnicroregion-level dummy variables to capture these
effects in an arbitrarily general way; these are fixed effect estimates. Secondly, we include variables designed to measure the community factors
directly. 2
2 We cannot hope to capture all factors which influence farmer decisions; what we hope to
do is identify among these factors, those which have a large influence on technology
adoption.

UPLAND RICE AND SOYBEAN FARMERS IN CENTRAL-WEST BRAZIL

345

Among the community factors, we include 'municipio' -level mean and
standard deviations of rice and soybean yields. These are derived from 7
years of data on municipio-level rice and soybean area and production. The
source is independent of the sample, so there are no artificial correlations
arising from data construction. Yields reflect, in part, past adoption of
technology. They also reflect underlying agro-climatic potential, which will
itself affect technology adoption. We use aggregate, municipio-level yield
measures to capture municipio effects which may be correlated with farmlevel adoption. By doing so we reduce problems of endogeneity that would
be greater if we used farm-level yields.
A second set of variables attempts to measure the level of services
available to formers. We do not use information at the farm level, such as
whether he or she has regular visits from an extension agent, because this
would be endogenous in our model. In particular extension visits may arise
because both the agent and the farmer want them. Agents may go to better
farm managers on better land (or land closer to their offices) so as to
maximize their impact. Provided there is useful information to extend there
is likely to be more demand for it by better farmers on better endowed land.
Thus inclusion of a farm level variable on extension contact is likely to give
an upward biased coefficient on extension, as well as biasing downwards the
education, experience and land quality coefficients. This may explain the
positive extension and negative education effects reported in the study of
Brazilian agriculture by Patrick and Kehrberg (1973).
The availability and quality of extension and other services at the community level may be more plausibly taken as exogenous to farmers. We have
gathered, independently from the farm survey, municipio level data on the
number of EMATER (Empresa Assistencia Technica Rurale - a state-level
extension agency) technicians, their average experience in EMATER and the
proportion who have at least a BS degree. In addition we have collected
information on whether the municipio is served by a cooperative or a radio
diffusion program, whether storage facilities are available (from CIBRAZEM - a public storage agency), and the number of banks which serve the
municipio.
Based on the sample, we construct the percentage of farmers who have
contact with EMBRAPA (Empresa Brasiliera de Pesquisa Agropecuaria the national agricultural research agency). Since there are too few sample
observations in each municipio to use that as a meaningful level of aggregation, we define this variable at the larger microregion level. 3
Theory suggests prices should also enter the reduced form. Unfortunately
we only have data on prices at the state level; since the survey covers three
3

346

states, there are not enough degrees of freedom to estimate price effects. To
the extent that prices are correlated with observed farm and community
characteristics, these estimates will be biased by the omission of prices
although the fixed effects estimates (which include micro-region controls)
will not be contaminated.
Having defined our variables we can outline the statistical model. Let

(1)
be the discounted expected profits function using the adopted technology
for the ith farm, where x; is a vector of characteristics defined above and e;
is a random error. Let

(2)
be discounted expected profits without the new practice. Let v; = v;A- v;N,
then if v; > 0 the technology or cultural practice is adopted, and not if
v; < 0. Note that we consider each practice separately. We do not observed
v; and e; but we do observe both X; and whether the practice is adopted or
not. Let D; = 1 if the practice is adopted, that is if v; > 0, then we have a
standard model of qualitative choice. If e; is assumed to be a Gaussian
random variate with mean zero and unit variance, then the statistical model
is a probit and can be estimated by maximum likelihood. Two dependent
variables are continuous 4 and are fitted by the method of least squares.
3. DESCRIPTION OF DATA

The data are drawn from a survey of rice and soybean farmers in the
Center-West conducted at CNPAF (Teixeira, 1987; Barbosa and Teixeira,
1987). Its main purpose was to explain, at the farm level, the reasons for the
expansion of soybeans, sometimes at the expense of food crops such as rice,
and to characterize the forms of production. The sample regions were
selected based on total acreage and production data for the two crops from
1973 to 1984. The municipios were selected based on the increase over time
of soybeans area and the decrease during the 1980's of rice areas. Two
hundred farmers were surveyed, of which complete data (including community data on infrastructure) are available for 161 farmers. Of these, 50% are in
Goias, and 25% each in Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul. Additional
data, collected at the municipio level, characterize the level of infrastructure
in the agricultural sector; these include information on storage and banking

They are an index of technology adoption and fertilizer use per hectare. Since almost all
farmers use some fertilizer, data censoring at zero is not a problem.

facilities, extension and education services, as well as a time series on area
planted and production of rice and soybeans.
Table 1 shows that farms in the Center-West are large: the average farmer
owns about 590 ha of land which is a little under 80% of the land he farms.
The proportion of land rented falls with the size of the farm owned (but
remains remarkably stable across the distribution of farms operated). Farms
tend to be slightly larger in Mato Grosso do Sul. The majority of the land on
the sample farms is planted with soybeans; among farmers who own less
than 100 hectares of land, soybean cultivation accounts for about 60% of
their farms but around one-half of farms operated by the larger landowners.
Rice accounts for about 8% of the farmed land and that proportion also
declines with the amount of land owned by the farmer. The proportion of
farmland given to pastures and fields rises with farmer wealth and accounts
for one fifth of the farm area of larger landholders. Forest and unproductive
land is much less prevalent on land of small farmers; these farmers rent land
almost exclusively for planting annual crops. Soybean yields, which are
higher than rice yields, show little pattern across the distribution of
landowners; rice yields on farms of small landowners are about a quarter
larger than those of large landowners.
Most of the farmers in the sample are migrants from other regions in
Brazil, particularly the South, and 60% of them have moved to the CenterWest in the last 10 years. Farmers who own more land tend to be older, have
more experience in these frontier areas and have more education. The
relationships between land owned and age, experience and education are
non-linear: farmers who own less than 100 ha (one-third of the sample) have
much less experience in the Center-West and also less education. The
pattern of experience suggests that farmers are buying more land the longer
they stay in the region.
For both soybeans and upland rice, the characteristics of fields used and
the frequency of adoption of various cultural practices and technologies, are
reported in Table 2 for all farmers and stratified by three farmer education
levels. Overall field characteristics are similar for the two crops. Upland rice
is more likely to be grown on flatter lands; less educated farmers tend to
plant upland rice on flatter land and better educated farmers tend to plant
soybeans on flatter land.
Soil analysis is more prevalent on soybeans fields. Use of some fertilizer is
nearly universal, however use of cover fertilizer is not. Almost one half of
soy plantings make use of seeds innoculated for nitrogen fixation capabilities and about three-quarters of rice seeds are treated for disease. Almost
half the rice plots are planted with seeds which are certified by the Ministry
of Agriculture and distributed by cooperatives and private firms. Soybean
seeds are planted in holes (the preferred method) on about a third of the

350

J. STRAUSS ET AL.

plots. Fifteen percent of the area planted to rice had blast problems and
some 10% of farmers treat their fields for blast.
For many cultural practices, better educated farmers adopt practices
which are preferred by agricultural researchers and extensionists. For both
rice and soybeans, better educated farmers are more likely to analyze the
soil, use cover fertilizer, use more of all fertilizer types per hectare and are
more likely to use treated seeds. The better educated farmers are more likely
to use certified rice seed.
Agronomists at CNPAF and CPAC (Centro de Pesquisa Agropecuaria do
Cerrado) have assigned a score to each soybean farmer based on the
appropriateness of the package of technologies chosen. Not surprisingly,
better educated farmers tend to score better on this index (out of 100)
although there is a large standard deviation around the mean.
Table 3 provides means and standard deviations of farmer access to
community infrastructure. Each municipio has, on average, just under four
EMATER technicians, each of whom has, on average, eight years of experience in the Center-West region and two of whom are likely to have a
Bachelor degree. Average regional experience of extension agents within a
municipio ranges from one year to fifteen. There are about five banks in
each municipio, some municipios having none; the majority are served by a
co-operative and have access to CIBRAZEM storage facilities although only
a third receive diffusion information by radio. Over the previous six years,

the mean and variance of soybean yields were about 25% higher than the
rice yields in the region.
4. TECHNOLOGY AND CULTURAL PRACTICES: REGRESSION RESULTS

Not all of the technology information collected in the survey is used in
the regression analysis. Some practices are adopted by almost everyone and
others by very few farmers; for these, there is no variation to explain. Some
practices, such as use of herbicides for soybean farmers, are very hard to
explain with the covariates we use; others are sufficiently close to those we
do report that they provide no additional information. We focus on nine
practices, five for upland rice and four for soybeans. They are whether the
farmer does soil analysis (for both rice and soybean fields); whether the
farmer uses certified rice seed or innoculated soybean seed; whether he uses
cover fertilizer (for rice) and total fertilizer usage per hectare (for rice and
soybeans); whether action is taken against rice blast (brusone); whether
soybean fields are planted in (preferred) holes (or whether rows are used).
Each dependent variable is estimated in isolation; these regressions cannot,
therefore, take account of complementarities in technological practices. We
include the CNPAF agronomists' index of soybean cultural practices as the
tenth dependent variable, treating it as a continuous dependent variable.
Relying on this index alone is unlikely to be a good empirical strategy; we
therefore consider it in conjunction with the regressions explaining the
adoption of individual practices.
The regression results, presented in Tables 4.1 and 4.2 for soybean and
rice cultivation respectively, are discussed by group of covariates. The
microregion-fixed effects estimates are in the first column of each pair; the
community-level characteristics are included in the second column. We
discuss, firstly, the effect of farmer human capital on the dependent variables, secondly, the effect of farm-level land quantity and quality variables,
thirdly the extension availability and quality variables, and finally the
community-level agro-climatic and infrastructure variables.
Farmer education and experience effects

Education of the farm operator has a positive effect, significant at the
10% level, in six of the ten regressions with microregion fixed effects and in
four when municipio level covariates replace the microregion dummies. The
overall index of soy cultivation practices rises six-tenths of a point for each
year of education. Part of this reflects that better educated soybean farmers
use more fertilizer (per ha). Better educated rice cultivators are more likely
to do soil analysis and use cover fertilizer. All of these effects are robust to

the inclusion of either region dummy variables or region-specific characteristics. Education has a significant positive effect only in the micro-region fixed
effects regressions in two cases: the probability of doing soil analysis for
soybean farmers and the amount of fertilizer used by rice farmers. This
difference in results between the two specifications suggests that there may
be interaction effects between education and community infrastructure; no
interactions, however, are statistically significant in the regressions using
region characteristics.
The age of the farmer, which is assumed to be a proxy for general
experience, does not explain any of the adoption patterns. Time spent in the
current region of residence is, however, strongly positively related for rice
farmers to the use of methods to control blast and for soybean bean farmers
to the probability of using preferred planting techniques. This suggests that
learning about the particular conditions of the Center-West region, and how
to cope with them, does occur for these farmers, who, recall, are mostly
immigrants from the South.
Land quantity and quality
The total area of land owned by the farmer is unrelated to the adoption of
new technology except that wealthier farmers are more likely to use certified
rice seed. Topography does seem to be related to the use of preferred
practices for soybean farmers. Farmers owning less level land are more
likely to plant with preferred methods and use more fertilizer per ha. For
upland rice farmers topography has less impact, except for a positive effect
on the use of cover fertilizer on farms with steeper slopes. The presence of
soil erosion is associated with lower probabilities of using preferred planting
methods for soybeans, but is not significantly related to other cultural
practices. All of the land quantity and quality effects are robust to the
inclusion of either microregion controls or community infrastructure characteristics.
Regional service availability
Farmer characteristics, in particular education and possibly local experience, can explain part of the technological adoption choice. They do not,
however, explain all the variation in the data and, in fact, the microregion
dummies are jointly significant in all the regressions. There is, apparently, a
good deal of variation which can be explained by community infrastructure
characteristics; we turn next to their impact on the adoption of technology.

UPLAND RICE AND SOYBEAN FARMERS IN CENTRAL-WEST BRAZIL

Extension and research availability and quality. We experimented with the
inclusion of three EMATER extension characteristics: the number of technicians (or technicians per farm), the proportion with a bachelor degree and
their average years of experience. These turn out to be too collinear for any
robust results to emerge, although they are jointly significant in a number of
cases. Some regularities do appear when only EMATER experience is
included in the regressions. Farmers in municipios where EMATER technicians have more experience have higher scores of the soybean technology
index and tend to use soybean seeds which are innoculated. These farmers
also tend to take soil analyses on their rice plots and use certified rice seed.
The effects of an additional year of experience by EMATER technicians is
comparable to, and sometimes larger than, the effect of a year of farmer
education. Interactions between EMATER experience and farmer education
proved not to be significant (not reported). Larger samples may be necessary
to test for substitutability or complementarity between these factors.
Fertilizer use is not associated with extension agent experience, nor is
using methods to control blast. Also planting soybeans using preferred
methods is negatively related to extension agent experience. Still the results
do suggest a role for the quality of extension agents, crudely measured, in
enhancing the effectiveness of extension agents (Feder and Slade, 1984).
The proportion of farmers (in the microregion) who have contact with
EMBRAPA personnel has no effect on soybean practices but does affect
upland rice farming practices. In particular the use of soil analyses, cover
fertilizer and the quantity per hectare of fertilizer use are all positively
related to the extent of EMBRAPA contacts within a region.
The net positive impacts of EMBRAPA and EMATER service availability is quite interesting and potentially important. In unreported probits
explaining the probability of a farmer having EMBRAPA or EMATER
contacts it was found that being better educated and younger made it more
likely to have contacts from EMBRAPA. EMBRAPA also seems to work
more in municipios with levelland, no radio diffusion programs and with
CIBRAZEM storage facilities. EMATER contacts are more likely in areas
with low soybean yields and those served by EMATER technicians with
more experience.
Other community infrastructure. The other community covariates appear to
have little impact on the adoption of these cultivation practices, although
there are a few notable exceptions. The existence of a cooperative office in a
municipio is positively related to using preferred planting methods for
soybeans. The number of banks in a municipio seems to increase the
likelihood of taking soil analyses and increasing fertilizer use on soybean
plots. The use of innoculated seeds seems to be negatively associated with

358

the number of banks. The existence of a radio diffusion program has a
positive effect only on the probability of using innoculated seeds but has no
impact on any of the other technology practices: radio diffusion seems to be
a poor substitute for extension services. The existence of CIBRAZEM
storage facilities in a municipio is positively associated with the use of
preferred planting practices for soybeans, but tends to be negatively related
to fertilizer use, soil analysis and using certified seed for rice. Why is not
clear. The existence of CIBRAZEM facilities tends to be in larger centers so
there apparently is some unmeasured effect that these areas have on certain
farming practices.
Regional agro-climatic conditions

Agro-climatic conditions are proxied at the mumc1p10 level by mean
soybean and rice yields, and the standard deviation of those yields over a
7-year period (1979/80-1985/86).
Only a few results emerge for upland rice; more fertilizer (per hectare)
and certified seed is more likely to be used in more productive municipios
(those with higher mean yields) although the variability of yields has no
effect on cultural practices. Soybeans are more likely to be planted with
preferred methods in higher yield and higher variance municipios; treated
seeds are more likely to be used in better endowed areas.
5. SUMMARY

These results suggest that it is possible to identify some of the determinants of the adoption of new technologies and cultural practices, at least
within the simple static model outlined in Section 2. Of the factors considered farmer education stands out as being important for both upland rice
and soybean technology adoption, as does the quality of extension agents.
The former result is consistent with numerous studies in the literature.
Rather few studies, however, have examined the impact of extension services
in a reduced form model. Of these we are not aware of other studies which
explicitly examine the role of the human capital of extension agents.
In sum, better educated farmers are more likely to do soil analyses and
use fertilizer on both rice and soy plots, farmers in areas with more
experienced EMATER agents are more likely to use treated or certified
seeds and use preferred planting methods again on both rice and soybean
plots. Relative to soybean farmers rice farmers are more responsive to
contact with EMBRAPA personnel and also to higher yields. Farmers with
more experience tend to adopt preferred planting methods (on soybean
plots) or controls for blast (on rice plots).

It would be preferable to explain both the extent and process of technological adoption by farmers; this would be possible only with longitudinal
data in which each farmer is tracked over several seasons. The results
reported above suggest that it may be prudent for both longitudinal and
cross section surveys to adopt a broader strategy to data collection on
technology adoption than is commonly found. In particular, in addition to
technological use data, it would be advantageous to collect information on
the human capital and socioeconomic characteristics of farmers, on indicators of land quality and on community level factors. Community-level
variables should include both those related to underlying agro-climatic
potentials and those related to the availability of relevant farm services. We
think that widening the scope of these surveys will have high marginal
returns in terms of helping program evaluators and policy makers understand the processes underlying technological adoption.
