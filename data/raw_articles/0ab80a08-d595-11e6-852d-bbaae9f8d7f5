Abstract

This paper examines sources of agricultural growth in sub-Saharan Africa. Growth in the stock of traditional
inputs (land, labor, livestock) remains the dominant source of output growth. Growth in modern input use was of
secondary importance, but still accounted for a 0.2-0.4% annual growth rate in three of four sub-regions.
Econometric results support earlier studies that suggest that land abundance may be a constraint on land
productivity growth. Growth in agricultural exports and historic calorie availability had positive impacts on
productivity. These latter results suggest that positive feedback effects exist between export performance and food
security on one hand and agricultural productivity on the other.

1. Introduction

Many econometric studies have examined agricultural productivity differences among countries
(e.g. Nguyen, 1979; Mundlak and Hellinghausen,
1982; Antle, 1983; Hayami and Ruttan, 1985; Lau
and Yotopolous, 1989; Haley, 1991; Ghura and
Just, 1992). These studies, which estimate aggregate agricultural production functions from international data, have been important in quantifying
the relative importance of such factors as modern
input use, research, infrastructure, and capital
accumulation on agricultural growth. Of these,
only the studies by Haley (1991) and by Ghura

and Just (1992) pay particular attention to countries in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).
This lack of attention is alarming for two reasons. First, agricultural productivity has been relatively stagnant in much of SSA. In the last 30
years, both land and labor productivity have declined in many SSA countries. Food production
per capita overall has declined and the number of
severely malnourished people in SSA has increased by over 20 million (Rao and Caballero,
1990).
There is evidence of significant productivity
growth in some countries (Thirtle et al., 1993).
These exceptions to the general pattern of stagnation beg the question of how such success
might be replicated elsewhere in SSA.
Agricultural stagnation has obvious and disturbing short-term consequences for the poor in
SSA. SSA's poor agricultural performance has a

second, negative implication for longer term industrial and general economic growth. Empirical
studies have found a significant correlation between agricultural and overall economic development (Singer, 1984). As Rao and Caballero (1990)
note, "very few countries have managed to maintain high rates of overall income or employment
growth without also achieving high rates of agricultural growth".
This paper examines sources of agricultural
productivity differences among 28 SSA countries.
These sources include land quality, modern input
use, public investment in agricultural research,
historic calorie availability, agricultural export
growth, and agricultural export instability. Intuitively, one can see how agricultural productivity
growth could enhance nutrition and agricultural
trade performance. The paper's results, however,
suggest that this relationship is not simply a unidirectional one from productivity to performance.
Rather, in the long run, there are important
positive feedback effects between calorie availability and trade performance on one hand and
productivity on the other.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2
presents the regression equation specification and
discusses the explanatory variables used in our
analysis. Section 3 discusses the regression results. In Section 4, the relative contribution of
traditional inputs, modern inputs and 'non-conventional' inputs to agricultural output and productivity growth are assessed for four major
agro-ecological regions of SSA.

country in year t. The variables X 1 , X 2 , X 3 , and
X 4 are measures of labor, fertilizer, tractor, and
livestock inputs respectively. The remaining Z
terms are 'non-conventional' inputs hypothesized
to affect a country's total factor productivity. The
{3j and 'Yk terms are parameters to be estimated
and uit is an error term.
The random errors, uit have the decomposition

(2)
where error terms ei, Tfp and Ein are independently distributed with zero means and positive
variances. The component ei is the random disturbance characterizing the ith country and is
constant through time. The component Tfn is the
random component characterizing year t and is
constant across countries. Eq. (1) is thus a two-way
random effects (error components) model and is
estimated using the method described by Fuller
and Battese (1974).
Agricultural output was defined as the total
value of current output in 1979-1981 international dollars. The international dollar is a unit
value developed by the Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) to avoid the use of exchange
rates in deriving production aggregates. Each
commodity is assigned a single world price. Production is then weighted by the 1979-1981 average of world prices. Output was measured on a
per hectare basis to avoid problems of heteroscedasticity. Agricultural land includes arable
and permanent cropland and permanent pastures. Data come from the F AO Production
Yearbook computer tape.

2. Methods and variables

2.1. Conventional inputs
An aggregate agricultural production function
was estimated from cross-section, time-series data
for 28 sub-Saharan Mrican countries for the years
1973-1985. Countries in the sample are listed in
the Appendix. The production function was specified as

k=l

where lit is the log of aggregate agricultural
output per hectare of agricultural land for the ith

Four conventional inputs were included in the
regression equation. Labor intensity, X 1 , is defined as the log of the ratio of persons economically active in agriculture to agricultural land.
Previous studies of agricultural productivity have
included only male labor as an input. Failing to
include female labor is a serious problem, particularly in SSA where women perform much of the
agricultural work. Ideally, one would want a measure of the flow of labor services rather than the

G. Frisvold, K IngramjAgricultural Economics 13 (1995) 51-61

number of persons economically active in agriculture which is a stock measure of labor input.
Unfortunately, comprehensive cross-section time
series data for the flow of labor services are not
available. The use of a labor stock variable of the
type employed here could significantly overestimate the amount of actual labor input utilized by
agriculture. Such overestimation can bias downward estimates of labor productivity as will be
discussed later.
Fertilizers, X 2 , is the log of the amount of
fertilizers used per hectare of arable and permanent cropland. Fertilizers are nitrogen, phosphates and potash consumed (kg). Tractor use
intensity, X 3 , is measured as the log of tractors in
service per hectare of arable and permanent
cropland. The stock of livestock, X 4 , was calculated from FAO data using the same aggregation
scheme employed by Hayami and Ruttan (1985).
Several studies have included a measure of livestock as a productive input (Nguyen, 1979; Mundlak and Hellinghausen, 1982; Antle, 1983; Hayami
and Ruttan, 1985).
2.2. Non-conventional inputs

Following the tradition of Hayami and Ruttan
(1985) and others, the total factor productivity
level of each country is measured as a function of
non-conventional inputs. These inputs are nonconventional in the sense that they capture the
impact of macroeconomic factors, public investment, agroecological specificity, and other factors
which affect agricultural productivity but which
are not traditional choice variables in farmers'
production decisions. These variables are defined
as follows.
2.2.1. Land quality (Z)
A static land quality index for each country
was obtained from Peterson (1987) which measures land quality as a function of historic precipitation and the percentage of area devoted to
pastures, irrigated crops, and non-irrigated crops.
2.2.2. Irrigation (Z 2 )
The level of irrigation technology and infrastructure is measured by the percentage of agricul-

53

tural cropland which the FAO designates as 'purposely provided with water'. Although the static
land quality index accounts for the extent of
irrigation at a single point in time, the irrigation
variable also accounts for changes in irrigation
over time.
2.2.3. Agricultural research (Z 3 )
An agricultural research intensity index was
calculated as the log of the research stock per
hectare of agricultural land. Data on country
public research investment come from the International Service for National Agricultural Research (ISNAR) Agricultural Research Indicator
Series reported in Pardoy et al. (1989). The research stock measure is an estimate of cumulative
research investment over the previous 8 years.
Pardey et al. report 5 year averages of research
expenditures from 1960 to 1985. In constructing
the research stock variable, it was assumed that
expenditures where constant over each 5 year
period.
2.2.4. Calorie availability (Z 4 )
A number of household level studies have
found that agricultural labor productivity improves with historic nutrient intake of laborers
(see Behrman et al., 1988 for a recent survey).
Far fewer studies have examined the impact of
nutrient intake at more aggregate levels. Two
exceptions are papers by Correa (1970) and
Wheeler (1980) which found a strong and significant positive correlation between economic
growth and nutrient intake in LDCs. Changes in
calorie availability seem likely to have important
productivity effects in SSA where 26% of the
population is deficient in calories for maintenance and 44% are deficient in calories for work
(Kates and Haarmann, 1992).
Variable Z 4 is the log of the ratio of daily
calorie supply per capita to daily calorie requirement per capita. The use of calorie availability as
an explanatory variable raises questions about
causality. Does better nutrition lead to increased
labor productivity or is more food available in
areas that are more productive? Or, are both
effects operative? To account for potential simultaneity bias, the calorie availability variable used

54

G. Frisuold, K. Ingram/ Agricultural Economics 13 (1995) 51-61

in regression analysis is a lagged 5 year average of
years t- 1 to t- 5. The lagged average was used
for two reasons. First, the direction of causality
from past consumption to current agricultural
production is more clearly unidirectional. Second,
a 5 year average better reflects historical nutrient
availability.
Estimates for both calorie supply and requirements are from the FAO. Calorie supplies are
calorie equivalents of a country's food supplies.
Food supplies comprise domestic production, net
imports, and changes in stocks. Daily calorie requirements are estimates of calories needed to
sustain a person at normal levels of activity and
health. Requirements for each country differ taking account of age and sex distributions, average
body weights, and environmental temperatures.
The calorie availability variable may also be
thought of as a measure of food security, albeit a
relatively crude one. The variable says nothing
about the distribution of food availability within a
country. However, it seems reasonable to expect
that as aggregate food availability declines chronic
food insecurity increases. Chronic food insecurity
represents a country's longer term difficulties in
meeting basic nutritional requirements. Food insecurity may adversely effect agricultural productivity for another reason besides its more direct
effect on labor productivity. In areas of chronic
insecurity agricultural producers are likely to
adopt risk-reducing rather than yield-increasing
production strategies (Roumasset, 1976).
2.2.5. Agricultural export growth (Z 5 )
The role of export growth in stimulating overall economic development (Fosu, 1990; GyimahBrempong, 1991; Edwards, 1993) and sectoral
total factor productivity growth (Tybout, 1992;
Edwards, 1993) has received much attention in
the literature.
Export development has been hypothesized to
stimulate productivity growth in a number of ways.
First, countries benefit from basic comparative
advantages and more rapid learning-by-doing
from specialization. Second, expansion into international markets allows the export sector to benefit from scale economies. Third, the pressures of
international competition are thought to force

countries to adopt modern technologies and efficient methods of production more quickly. Fourth,
exports form an important source of foreign exchange necessary for importation of modern inputs and capital formation. Finally, export levies
are an important source of government revenues
in many SSA countries. Changes in export earnings, therefore, affect the level of public funds
available to finance irrigation projects, road construction, and other productivity-enhancing public investments.
Studies of the impact of export growth on
output growth have generally examined the relationship between export growth and gross domestic product (GDP) growth, but have not specifically examined the impact of agricultural export
growth on agricultural productivity. Mundlak et
al. (1989) estimated agricultural productivity as a
function of past agricultural export prices rather
than past export earnings. Although earnings and
prices are not the same, the results of Mundlak et
al. do suggest a relationship between international market behavior and domestic productivity.
Growth of agricultural export earnings is likely to
have a 'demand-pull' effect on technological innovation in the agricultural export sector.
The following regression equation was estimated to construct and export growth and export
instability variable
ln(Eit) =a 0 +a 1ln(t) +a 2 [ln(t)] 2 +vit

(3)

where Eit is the value of agricultural exports in
constant dollars. Separate regression equations
were estimated for each country. The log
quadratic specification of regression equation (3)
fit the data very well with adjusted R 2 values
over 0.90 for all countries in the sample. The log
quadratic specification also fit the data better
than simple quadratic of semi-log specifications.
The predicted values of exports for country i in
year t from Eq. (3) are given by Eit· The export
growth variable is

( 4)
and reflects the growth trend in exports in a
country over the previous 5 years.
Including export performance as an explanatory variable again raises issues of causality. Ed-

G. Frisvold, K. Ingram 1 Agricultural Economics 13 (1995) 51-61

wards (1993) provides more discussion of problems of determining causality between export
growth and other measures of economic performance such as GDP and productivity growth. As
with calorie intake, this was accounted for by
using past values of performance as an explanatory variable. Fig. 1 shows the long-term relationship between agricultural productivity and performance. Current productivity has more immediate
impacts on current food security and export performance. In the longer run, we hypothesize that
food security and export performance affect future productivity. There is thus a positive feedback loop over time between productivity and
performance.

2.2.6. Agricultural export instability (Z 6 )
We also test the hypothesis that agricultural
export instability could have a negative impact on
productivity. Fluctuations in foreign exchange derived from export earnings may adversely affect
the timing and availability of modern imported
inputs (Love, 1989a). Also, fluctuations in foreign
exchange may reduce the efficiency of public
investments to raise agricultural productivity
(Love, 1989b). Development projects may proceed in an erratic and halting manner. Fosu
(1992), however, found little evidence to support
the hypothesis that export instability had a negative impact on GDP growth in SSA.
The instability of agricultural exports was constructed as follows
Z 6 =In(

_t vi~r-j))

(5)

where

are the residuals from Eq. (3). The

instability index captures the effects of deviations
from trend in export growth over the previous 5
years, placing relatively more weight on more
extreme deviations from trend. This specification
is similar to those employed previously in the
literature (Fosu, 1990; Gyimah-Brempong, 1991).
3. Regression results

Regression results are presented in Table 1.
The Fuller-Battese method (variance components model) is used. Regression equation (1) is a
land productivity equation, given that the dependent variable is agricultural output per
hectare. Column 1 reports results from the general specification of Eq. (1). Column 2 excludes
variables found to be insignificant in the general
regression. Results from Column 1 are discussed
in this section while the results from Column 2
are used in the following section on growth accounting.
The model fits the data well. The R 2 between
observed and predicted values of the dependent
variable is over 0.94 for both models. The explanatory variables generally show a high level of
statistical significance and are economically plausible. The random component (variance component) characterizing unspecified country effects is
the largest portion of the error in the model.
The output elasticity of labor is about 0.59
which is very high relative to those of other
conventional inputs. Haley obtained similar results in his study of agricultural production in
SSA. Again, we should caution that the explanatory variable is the stock of labor (persons economically active in agriculture) rather than the

flow of labor services. The labor variable used
here is really a measure of rural population density, or inversely, land scarcity. Binswanger and
Pingali (1988) have elaborated on the earlier work
of Boserup (1965) which considered the impacts
of population pressure on land productivity. They
argue that land scarcity induces institutional and
technological innovations which raise land productivity and that the relative land abundance in
many parts of SSA are barriers to land productivity growth. Thus, the relatively large regression
coefficient on the labor stock per hectare variable
may be reflecting this 'Boserup effect'.
The output elasticities for traditional inputs
labor and livestock are higher than those of
'modern' inputs, fertilizers and tractors. The pas-

itive and statistically significant coefficient for
tractor intensity is at odds with a more detailed
study by Pingali et al. (1987) which found that
tractors did not increase yields in 10 out of 14
cases of tractor adoption in SSA countries. However, the results are consistent with the cross-section, time-series estimates obtained by Ghura and
Just (1992) for East Mrica. The land quality
index was highly significant while the irrigation
variable was not. This may be due to the fact that
Peterson's (1987) land quality index implicitly accounts for the extent of irrigation in calculation
of land quality.
The estimated elasticity of land productivity
with respect to the research stock was low (less
than 0.05) and statistically significant only at the
10% level for a one-tailed t-test. This implies that
research has yet to generate broad sectoral productivity growth in SSA agriculture. We experimented with estimating different impacts of research across sub-regions and with interacting
research with measures of quality of national
research programs reported in Cleaver (1993). In
neither case did research prove to be significant.
This could be for a number of reasons. First, the
time lags for research impacts may stretch back
farther than the data available to construct the
research stock variable. Other possible reasons
discussed in the literature include lack of critical
mass of researchers, lack of spending per researcher, lack research historically in tropical and
desert zones, and lack of congruence between
output and research mix (Lipton, 1988; Eicher,
1990).
The output elasticity of historic calorie intake
is quite high, over 0.34. This is consistent with
results obtained by Correa (1970) and Wheeler
(1980) who found a strong responsiveness of economic growth to improvements in nutrition. Estimating a simultaneous model of basic needs provision and economic growth, Wheeler found that
the elasticity of economic growth with respect to
improved nutrition was nearly 2.0 in very poor
less developed countries (LDCs). The very high
elasticities of both labor input and calorie intake
suggest that improved labor productivity through
provision of basic nutrition requirements is a
potentially great source of agricultural growth.

G. Frisvold, K. Ingram I Agricultural Economics 13 (1995) 51-61

The results relating past trade performance to
productivity are mixed. The coefficient on agricultural export growth was positive and significant at the 1% level (from a two-tailed t-test).
We found no evidence that past export instability
affected productivity. These two results for the
agricultural sector in SSA match those obtained
by Fosu (1990, 1992) regarding trade performance and overall GOP growth.

time 0, Qit - Q;o, can be written as

(6)
In other words, output growth is the sum of
land productivity growth and the rate of land
expansion.
The regression results obtained from estimating Eq. (1) can be used to express land productivity growth as a function in changes in conventional and non-conventional inputs

4. Accounting for agricultural growth

4

This section presents results of a simple accounting exercise which measures the relative
contribution of production inputs and other variables to growth in agricultural output and land
productivity. Agricultural output growth can be
written as a function of agricultural intensification (an increase in output per hectare) and extensification (expansion of agricultural land). Let
Q be the log of output, A the log of agricultural
land area, and Y the log of land productivity
(output per hectare). The continuous growth rate

of output-weighted geometric averages of sample
countries in each zone. Output growth over this
period ranged from 1.15 to 2.07%. This rate does
not keep pace with the 2.8% rate of population
growth over the same period. Output growth came
predominantly from land productivity growth.
Land expansion, however, remains an important
source of output growth, accounting for 0.160.53% increases in annual output growth. Growth
attributable to land expansion relative to overall
growth was higher in more humid regions of SSA
but is relatively less important in semiarid and
sub-humid zones. Land expansion was particularly important in Burundi, Cameroon, Ivory
Coast, Madagascar and Sierra Leone. In the
Semi-Arid Tropics and Lowland Humid Tropics,
production shifted toward countries with lower
land quality reducing the weighted average regional growth - 0.06% per year.
Growth in land productivity came primarily
from growth of conventional inputs. The major
source of land productivity growth was the increase in the number of economically active persons in agriculture per hectare of agricultural
land. This result is consistent with arguments put
forth in Binswanger and Pingali (1988) that land
abundance in tropical countries, particularly SSA,

Land productivity growth is thus a decomposition of growth in conventional and non-conventional inputs. The restricted regression (Table 1,
Column 2) was used in the growth accounting
exercise.
Sample countries were classified into four
agro-ecological zones based on Oram et al. (1990).
The Semi-Arid Tropical Rainfall Zone is characterized by a 75-150 day growing season with
major crops being millet, sorghum and groundnuts. The Sub-humid Tropical Summer Rainfall
Zone has 150-210 day growing seasons and cropping patterns are heavily dependent on altitude.
The major crop in this region is maize. Only two
countries in our sample, Madagascar and Mauritius lie in the Lowland Humid Tropical Zone
which has a growing season of 180-365 days.
Dominant crops are rice, sugar, roots and tubers,
and coffee. In the Humid Tropical Zone, the
growing season increases from north to south in
West Africa. Major commodities are roots and
tubers. Sample countries are listed by agro-ecological zone in the Appendix.
Table 2 shows the decomposition of agricultural output and land productivity growth rates
for the four agro-ecological zones between 19731975 and 1983-1985. Table 2 reports growth rates

reduce incentives for farmers to adopt yield-increasing technologies. Substantial increases in
land productivity should not be expected until
land becomes relatively scarce.
We should reiterate that growth in the stock of
the agricultural labor force is not the same as
changes in the flow of labor services. For example, the F AO data suggest that the stock of labor
per hectare in Zimbabwe has been rising. Here,
the stock refers to the number of economically
active persons in agriculture. However, the more
detailed country level study of Thirtle eta!. (1993),
based on constructed Divisia indexes indicates
that on-farm labor intensity has been declining.
Thus, the F AO data may be underestimating
growth rates of labor productivity, while capturing productivity benefits induced by growing land
scarcity.
Improvements in historic calorie availability
contributed more positively to output growth than
increases in fertilizer use in all regions except the
Humid Tropics. It should be noted that the base
period is the early 1970s, when many areas were
suffering from extreme drought. Recovery from
the drought conditions of this period may have
contributed to longer term productivity growth,
particularly in the Sahel region. The results are
consistent with those of Wheeler (1980) and Correa (1970) who found that improved calorie intake made significant contributions to long-term
economic growth in LDCs. The results also provide some support to the 'basic needs' strategies
of development (Wheeler, 1980).
Fig. 2 shows the relative contribution of different factors to agricultural output growth in a
slightly different manner than Table 2. Output
growth is decomposed into contributions by traditional inputs (land, labor stock, livestock) modern
inputs (fertilizers, tractors), agricultural export
growth, calorie availability and land quality. Fig. 2
shows that the primary source of output growth
in SSA remains growth in stocks of traditional
inputs. Modern inputs (tractors, fertilizers) were
next in importance in terms of contribution to
output growth, except in the Lowland Humid
Tropics where use did not increase appreciably.
Regional averages mask differences across countries, however. For example, in the Semi-Arid

59

Tropical region, Botswana, Chad, Senegal, Somalia, and Sudan all experienced declines in fertilizer use even though the regional average of
fertilizer use increased (Table 2). In Rwanda,
intensity of all modern inputs declined. A deterioration of agricultural trade performance, in
terms of export growth, affected all regions but
the Semi-Arid Tropics. Negative export growth
elsewhere accounted for an annual decrease in
productivity of - 0.07 to - 0.12% per year (Table
2).

5. Conclusions

This paper examined sources of agricultural
growth in sub-Saharan Africa. Growth in the
stock of traditional inputs (land, labor, livestock)
remains the dominant source of output growth.
Growth in modern input use was of secondary
importance, but still accounted for a 0.2-0.4%
annual growth rate across three of four sub-regions. Econometric results are consistent with the
argument of Binswanger and Pingali (1988) that
increasing land scarcity is a prerequisite for
growth in land productivity.
Results also indicated that research has yet to
generate broad sectoral productivity growth in
SSA agriculture. We experimented with estimating different impacts of research across sub-regions and with interacting research with measures
of quality of national research programs. In neither case did we find a statistically significant
relationship between research stock variables and
aggregate agricultural productivity.
The estimated elasticity of agricultural output
with respect to calorie intake was quite high,
about 0.35. This is consistent with results obtained by Correa and by Wheeler who found a
strong responsiveness of economic growth to improvements in nutrition. The very high elasticities
of both labor and calorie intake suggest that
improved labor productivity through provision of
basic nutrition requirements is a potentially great
source of agricultural growth. Improved calorie
availability contributed more to output growth
than did growth in fertilizer use in all regions
except the Humid Tropics.

Another important finding is that trade performance is an important determinant of longer-term
productivity growth. Agricultural export growth
was found to have a statistically significant positive impact on productivity. Negative export
growth in many countries over the sample period
accounted for productivity losses in three of four
regions in the study. These latter results suggest
important positive feedback effects exist between
trade performance and food security on one hand
and agricultural productivity on the other.
