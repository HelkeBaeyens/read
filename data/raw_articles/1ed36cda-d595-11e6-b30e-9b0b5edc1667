Abstract
Extensification of agriculture is one of the major factors contributing to the destruction of forests in Africa. In
Sudan, such horizontal expansion comes at the expense of land devoted to trees and other vegetation, thereby
inducing conditions that are inimical to sustainable agricultural production. Different factors have contributed to
extensification. Although high economic returns from crop (mainly sorghum) production was an important factor
encouraging extensification of rainfed mechanized farming, other factors outside agriculture have also contributed to
that expansion. This paper uses data from eastern Sudan and an acreage response model, to identify the most
important factors influencing acreage expansion. Different measures and forms of risk were used in the acreage
response model. The paper shows how policies in the energy sector can indirectly influence acreage expansion in the
agricultural sector.

1. Introduction

Degradation of natural resources in the developing countries can be regarded as arising for
three primary reasons: (1) explicit government
policies to satisfy domestic needs or to increase
exports to earn foreign exchange; (2) misguided
management policies that have as their intent the
actual protection of natural resources; and (3) the
interrelations between other economic policies

and the natural resource base of a country
(Bromley, 1986). In this paper we report on empirical research highlighting the third of these
phenomena - the interaction of various economic
policies and events that may seem, on the surface, to be unrelated. Specifically, this research
illustrates the linkage between energy supply and
pricing policy and agricultural extensification that is, the horizontal expansion of agriculture
into forested areas - in eastern Sudan. 1 While

the specific venue of the research is Sudan, similar phenomena exist throughout the Sahel.
When imported oil was a cheap source of
energy in Sudan, there was scant incentive to
clear land for charcoal production. The high cost
of land clearing was one of the main factors that
protected forested areas against horizontal expansion of rainfed agriculture (Affan, 1984).
However, when oil prices began to rise in the
1970's, charcoal suddenly became a competitive
energy source for urban dwellers deprived of
affordable petroleum products. Moreover, the increase in the population of urban areas from
in-migration has led to significant increases in the
demand for charcoal. The subsequent increase in
charcoal prices soon cast the forest in a new light
to farmers and herders who then began to exploit
forests to produce charcoal for urban markets.
Consequently, the increased revenue potential
from clearing land for agriculture has meant that
land-clearing costs no longer act as an impediment to accelerated deforestation for creating
arable land. Hence, the high returns from charcoal production were hypothesized to be another
important factor contributing to the expansion of
agriculture into marginal lands at the expense of
forested areas. This continued expansion of rainfed agriculture in response to important but unintended incentives can be a serious policy problem
facing many poor countries.
2. Setting

The rainfed mechanized farming schemes got
their start in Sudan in 1944, in an area of about
12 000 feddans, 2 primarily to feed troops stationed in East Africa during World War II. The
Government then began to encourage the private
sector to participate in these schemes. The high
economic returns of early settlers encouraged
other participants and so resulted in a fairly rapid
expansion of the area cleared for cultivation. By
1985 the total area under rainfed mechanized
farming was about 7.4 million feddans (Earl,
1985). While called mechanized farming, in fact
2

feddan = 1.04 acre "' 0.42 ha.

only land preparation and sowing are mechanized. Weeding (if any) and harvesting are manual operations. The grain is cut by hand and
threshed by stationary harvesters (Ibnouf, 1985).
Four crops are grown - dura (sorghum), sesame,
millet and cotton. However, dura accounts for
80-90% of the land area (Affan, 1984). Sesame is
the second most important crop, while millet and
cotton are grown in very limited areas. This trend
seems persistent over time.
On the rainfed mechanized schemes, land is
leased by the Government to farmers in lots of
1000-2000 feddans for a renewable period of 25
years at a nominal land rent (LS0.05 per feddan
per year 3 - approximately $0.13 per acre - in
1976). These farms are referred to as demarcated
farms. In addition to the demarcated farms, there
are large areas of land that have been cleared
without authorization; these areas are referred to
as undemarcated farms. Whether authorized (demarcated) or not, the typical farming practice is
continuous cropping - defined here as putting
cleared land under production of the same crop
(dura) for successive years without fallowing (or
with a very short fallow period). Shifting cultivation to new areas (which are sometimes marginal
lands) occurs when yields decline below a profitable level. Although some ecological safeguards
- such as shelterbelts and crop rotation - are
required by the Mechanized Farming Corporation, these practices are rarely followed. In general, no fertilizers, insecticides or pesticides are
applied to these cropped lands and so it comes as
no surprise that, over time, productivity declines. 4
3. Empirical model
An acreage response model was used to study
the acreage expansion in the rainfed mechanized

Fertilizers, insecticides and pesticides are imported and
made available only to irrigated schemes. Following the rotation prescribed by the Mechanized Farming Corporation
(MFC) would eliminate (or at least reduce) the need for these
chemicals in the rainfed mechanized farms. However, easy
access to land and lack of law enforcement discourage farmers to follow the MFC's recommendations.

sector of Sudan. In most of the econometric
studies of acreage response it has been recognized that risk with respect to price, yield and
income influences farmers' production decisions
(Adesina and Brorsen, 1987; Behrman, 1968;
Chavas and Holt, 1990; Just, 1974; Ryan, 1977;
Trail, 1978; Wilson et al., 1980; Wolgin, 1975). In
these studies, risk has been expressed in a 'symmetric' form which considers both very high and
very low returns as undesirable (Markowitz, 1970).
However, one expects producers to be more concerned about negative than positive deviations
from a targeted price, yield or income. Therefore,
an 'asymmetric' risk analysis that utilizes only the
negative deviations may be preferred to a symmetric risk analysis (Tronstad and McNeill, 1989).
Models estimated in this paper utilize both
symmetric and asymmetric forms of risk. Different variables were used to represent riskiness of
price or production. These variables range from
simple expressions such as a moving range or
absolute difference between expected and actual
price (Brennan, 1980) to more complicated expressions such as moving standard deviations
(Behrman, 1968; Just, 1974).
Dura accounts for 80-90% of the land area
under the rainfed mechanized sector (Affan,
1984). Hence, the focus here is on the acreage
response for dura only. Millet and cotton are
grown on very limited areas. Therefore, variation
in prices of millet and cotton can be expected not
to affect the acreage response for dura. Sesame is
the second crop in rainfed agriculture and shares
with millet and cotton the remaining 10-20% of
the land area. Therefore, the initial models included sesame price, sesame price risk and the
covariance between dura and sesame prices as
explanatory variables. However, nested F-tests
could not reject the null hypothesis that all coefficients on sesame variables were simultaneously
equal to zero. Hence, these variables are not
included in the empirical model. The price of
charcoal is included because farmers can make
use of cleared trees to produce charcoal. This is
expected to be an added incentive for farmers to
clear more land for cultivation. The revenue from
charcoal can offset, or at least reduce, the cost of
land clearance (Earl, 1985). The empirical model,

is expected dura real price 5 in 0.01 Sudanese

yield in kilogram per feddan; ERF1 is expected
rainfall in millimeter; DPR 1 is dura price risk; and
RFR 1 is rainfall risk. Economic theory provides
little help in choosing the appropriate functional
form and so different functional forms were tried.
The form in Eq. (1) gives the best fit of the data.
The data used in this study are limited to the
eastern region (Gedarif) which contains the
largest area devoted to rainfed mechanized agriculture. The data do not distinguish between
demarcated and undemarcated schemes. More
complete data were available for the period
1969-1985 and were used for this study. Data
sources include different publications. Data on
areas cultivated, rainfall and yields are from the
Mechanized Farming Corporation (MFC, 1984).
The Department of Agricultural Economics and
Statistics (1986, 1987, 1989) provided data on
areas cultivated, yields and production costs, while
the Department of Statistics (undated) is the
source of data on prices. Data on consumer price
index and charcoal prices are from the National
Energy Administration (1987). Charcoal prices
for the eastern region were not available. Hence,

The consumer price index was used to deflate dura price
and cost of production. While a price index for agricultural
mputs would have been a better index for deflating costs of
production, lack of data precluded this approach.

we used charcoal prices for the province of Khartoum, a main market for the charcoal produced
in Gedarif. Costs of production data are supplemented with data from Thimm (1979) and El
Hadari and Suliman (1980). The data are estimates based on cross-section surveys conducted
annually by the different government departments.
The expected real price (EDPt) is assumed to
be a linear function of last year's real price (opt_ 1)
according to the maximum-likelihood-estimated
equation: 7

where t-values are given in parentheses.
Farmers need not form expectations about
charcoal price because charcoal making can proceed rapidly. Therefore, the price of charcoal at
time t is the observed market price in that year.
Land preparation and sowing costs are a major
part of production costs and both are known to
farmers before land allocation decisions are taken.
Hence, production costs are treated as non-stochastic. The expected dura yield and expected
rainfall are assumed to be last year's yield and
rainfall, respectively. 8
Two forms of risk analysis (symmetric and
asymmetric) are used. Within each form two variables (simple and complex) are used to represent
risk. Hereafter, Xt is dura real price or rainfall,
while EXt refers to the expected value. For both
price and rainfall risk, the following risk variables
are defined. The symmetric-simple measure of
risk (sxR~) is the absolute value of the difference
between the actual and expected values for the
previous year:
SXR~

= abs(Xt-l- EXt_ 1 )

(3)

7 A Durbin h-test indicated first-order autocorrelation. The
equation was, therefore, estimated by maximum likelihood.
8 Last year's rainfall gave better statistical results than the
average rainfall over the last 2, 3 and 4 years. We also
regressed yield on time and experimented with the expected
values as a proxy for expected yield. However, yield from the
previous year gave better statistical results.

On the other hand, the symmetric-complex measure of risk (sxR~) is a moving standard deviation
of X 1 over the previous three years (Behrman,
1968):

sxR~ =

where

The asymmetric-simple measure of risk (ASXR~)
equals the absolute value of the difference between actual and expected values for the previous
year if the expected value exceeds the actual
corresponding value and zero otherwise:

Economic theory suggests that the supply of a
commodity increases as its (expected) price increases ({3 1 > 0). An increase in production costs
is expected to decrease the acreage for dura
({3 2 < 0). By converting the cleared trees into
charcoal the farmer can make some small profit,
or at least reduce the net costs of land clearance.
Therefore, we hypothesize that an increase in
charcoal price will induce farmers to clear and
cultivate more land ({3 3 > 0). An increase in expected yield (EDY) will mean an increase in expected income and so {3 4 is expected to be positive. Because we are concerned here with rainfed
agriculture, the area cultivated is expected to
increase as farmers expect higher rainfall ({3 5 > 0).
Assuming that farmers are risk-averse, an increase in perceptions of risk (oPR or RFR) is
expected to shift the acreage curve to the left
({36 < 0; {37 < 0).

4. Empirical results

Table I
Results of the non-nested ]-test

Four versions of Eq. (1) were estimated by
maximum likelihood procedures (Judge et a!.,
1982). The four versions differ only in the risk
variables (oPR and RFR). Accordingly, these four
versions are the symmetric-simple, symmetriccomplex, asymmetric-simple and asymmetriccomplex risk models. The symmetric form of risk
is tested against the asymmetric form, and the
simple measure of risk is tested against the complex measure using the non-nested ]-test (Davidson and MacKinnon, 1981). The results of the
pairwise ]-test are presented in Table 1. Generally, Table 1 shows that the asymmetric-risk models were preferred to the symmetric-risk models
and the simple measures of risk were preferred to
complex measures (for more detail, see Elnagheeb and Bromley, 1991).
Table 2 presents the maximum likelihood estimates of the four risk models along with the
estimates of the conventional non-risk model. In

collinearity between expected rainfall and expected yield.
An interesting result is that charcoal price has
a positive coefficient which is significant at the
5% level of significance in all models. This finding supports the hypothesis that higher charcoal
prices act as an added incentive for farmers to
clear land for cultivation. The result may explain,
at least partially, why farmers in the rainfed
mechanized schemes do not leave a portion of
their land in trees for shelterbelts as required by
the Mechanized Farming Corporation. The result
also illustrates the interrelationships between the
energy and agricultural sectors. Policies such as
import restrictions on oil products and distorted
prices of energy resources, influence charcoal
prices and indirectly influence land-clearing costs
- and thus influence the total acreage under dura
production.
If farmers are risk-responsive (presumably
risk-averse), they should cultivate smaller areas as
price and rainfall risk increase. This hypothesis is
supported by all risk models in Table 2. The
coefficients on the price and rainfall risk variables are negative in all models and significantly
different from zero except for the asymmetricsimple measure of rainfall risk. Further, a nested
F-test rejected, at the 10% level of significance,
the null hypothesis that both coefficients on price
and rainfall risk variables are simultaneously
equal to zero. The hypothesis is rejected in all
risk models. The F(2, 8) values are 4.16, 3.72,
7.15 and 6.83 for the symmetric-simple, symmetric-complex, asymmetric-simple and asymmetriccomplex risk models, respectively (the tabulated

a

F-value is 3.11). Hence, our results suggest that
both price and rainfall risks are important decision variables in the intended level of dura production in the rainfed farming schemes of Sudan.
As expected, omission of the risk variables
biased the estimates of the coefficients of the
remaining variables and consequently biased the
estimates of their respective elasticities. Since the
expected dura price (EoP 1 ) is assumed to be a
linear function of last year's price (oP 1 _ 1), the
elasticity of DP1 _ 1 can be obtained from (see Eq.
2):
E

=(a ln(A 1 )jaoP 1 _ 1 )(oP*)
= 0.566671(a ln(A 1 )/aEoP)(oP*)

(7)

where op* is the average of DP1 _ 1. The acreage
response elasticities for the risk and non-risk
models are reported in Table 3.
Table 3 shows that dura acreage response was
price-inelastic; a 1% increase in real dura price
resulted in about 0.4-0.5% increase in dura
acreage. Omission of the risk variables has led to
underestimated price elasticity - except for the
asymmetric-simple risk model. This result is consistent with results from other research (Adesina
and Brorsen, 1987; Hurt and Garcia, 1982; Ryan,
1977). Therefore, any policy decisions related to
the price of dura in a non-risk model would likely
result in underestimated dura acreage response.
Both price-risk and rainfall-risk elasticities from
the asymmetric-simple risk model are the least (in
absolute value) when compared to those obtained
from the other risk models. The acreage response
elasticities from the symmetric-complex and
asymmetric-complex risk models compare favorably except for the risk variables. The asymmetric-complex risk model gives the highest elasticities, in absolute value, with respect to the risk
variables. These results imply that dura acreage
seems more responsive to asymmetric than to
symmetric price and rainfall risk.
Although price risk is found to be an important decision variable, its elasticity is smaller, in
absolute value, than the price elasticity in all risk
models. This result accords rather well with that
found by Adesina and Brorsen (1987), Winter
and Whittaker (1979) and Ryan (1977).

A.H. Elnagheeb, D. W Bromley/ Agricultural Economics 10 (1994) 193-200

Table 3 also shows that dura acreage was as
responsive to cost of production as it was to dura
price. This result is important because a good
part of the costs of production is the cost of
gasoline which is subsidized by the government.
Hence, the government can directly influence the
dura acreage through controlling both the amount
and price of gasoline.

5. Conclusions

Data from the rainfed mechanized farming
sector of Sudan were used to estimate an acreage
response model for dura (sorghum). Models that
utilize symmetric and asymmetric forms of risk
using different variables (simple and complex) to
measure risk were estimated.
Dura acreage increased with dura's expected
price, or expected yield and decreased with costs
of production. Sesame prices were not found to
influence dura acreage. An increase in charcoal
price could be an added incentive for farmers to
increase dura acreage. Therefore, policies that
directly influence charcoal prices - e.g. oil import
restrictions - should consider the impacts of
charcoal pricing on acreage expansion. Although
production of charcoal will save the country some
badly needed foreign exchange, it will have an
expansionary effect on the dura acreage. This
process of deforestation will everitually have a
negative effect on the production of charcoal
itself as more trees are destroyed.
Farmers in the rainfed mechanized farming
were found to be responsive to risk in prices and
rainfall. Omission of risk from acreage response
models would likely lead to underestimated price
elasticities. Price and rainfall risk negatively influence dura acreage. Hence, policies to reduce
dura price variability should consider the likely
acreage-increasing effect of such policies. Hence,
for any policy that leads to agricultural expansion, the benefits from such an expansion in total
dura production should be compared to its costs
in terms of the environmental degradation from
accelerated deforestation (Simpson, 1978; El
Tayeb and Lewandowski, 1983; El Taheir, 1987;
Whitney, 1987).
