Abstract
This paper examines the relative economic efficiency of small and large rice farms in Cote d'Ivoire using a profit function approach. No
differences in the relative economic efficiency of small and large farms were found. This conclusion is robust under alternative model
specifications. Agrarian reforms directed towards further concentration of landholding for large farms in Cote d'Ivoire cannot be justified
based on economic efficiency. Results show that access to credit and use of modem rice varieties significantly increase profits. To improve
technical efficiency of rice farms, an accelerated program to provide information, credit, improved seeds and other inputs is needed. When
all the farms (i.e. large and small) are taken together, there is evidence of allocative inefficiency. Strategies are needed to remove such
management related inefficiencies in rice production either through the development of a better market price information system or effective
farmer-oriented technical training programs by rice extension workers.

1. Introduction

Agricultural policy makers in developing countries face difficult decisions in their choice of agrarian structure to achieve the dual goals of growth and
equity in the agricultural sector (Dorner, 1972; Khan
and Maki, 1979; Noronha, 1985; Lele and Agarwal,
1989; Deininger and Binswanger, 1995). Often,
agrarian policies favor large farms under the presumption that they are more economically efficient
than small farms (Dorner, 1972; Khan and Maki,

Agriculture, Humid Forest Program, BP 2008, Yaounde,
Cameroon.

1979; Kydd and Christiansen, 1982; Lele and Agarwal, 1989; Kouadio and Pokou, 1991; Deininger and
Binswanger, 1995). Several attempts have been made
in Africa to encourage large scale farms. Examples
include policies favoring collectivized agriculture that
dominated production relations in Tanzania in the
1970s (McHenry, 1979); state-imposed tenure conversion arrangements in Kenya that led to further
land consolidation, concentration and marginalization of small farms (Brokensha and Glazier, 1973;
Njeru, 1978; Okoth-Ogendo, 1986); diversion of institutional credit to large farms in Kenya and Malawi
(Kydd and Christiansen, 1982; Lele and Meyers,
1986); subsidization of land settlement, irrigation
and mechanization costs in Nigeria (Lele et al.,
1989); policy-induced land, labor and output market

interventions to favor large European farms over
African smallholder farms in Kenya, Zimbabwe and
South Africa (Deininger and Binswanger, 1995) or
restrictive market differentiation that gave large farms
legal rights to grow specific crops for export in
Malawi (Christiansen and Kydd, 1987).
The presumed superior economic efficiency of
large farms may, however, be illusory due to the
high social costs of the preferential public policies
that have maintained them. Experiences with most
large-farm led agrarian reforms within dual farm size
structures have been mixed (Lele and Agarwal, 1989;
Collier et al., 1990; Bruce and Migot-Adholla, 1994).
Deininger and Binswanger (1995) suggest that incorporating rent seeking behavior in the theory of production relations may explain the existence of such
dual farm size structures in Kenya, Zimbabwe and
South Africa. Policies that were used to reduce the
'reservation utility' of the African smallholder farms
in these countries included restrictive land, labor and
output market regulations. In the absence of these
policy distortions, large European farms could not
have been competitive with the African smallholder
farms. Lele and Agarwal (1989) compared domestic
resource costs for the production of coffee and tea in
Kenya for large and smallholder farms. Their estimates showed a strong comparative advantage in
smallholder production, and they argued that this
possibly explains why the colonial government imposed restrictions on smallholder farms producing
tea and coffee in Kenya. However, Lele and Agarwal
(1989) and Deininger and Binswanger (1995) and
did not specifically test for economic (i.e. price and
technical) efficiency differences between the large
and small farms in their insightful analyses.
Previous studies in Asia have tested for relative
efficiency differences by farm size, with conflicting
results. Lau and Yotopoulos (1971) and Yotopoulos
and Lau (1973) found that small wheat farms in the
Indian Punjab were more economically efficient than
large farms. In Pakistan, Khan and Maki ( 1979)
found that large farms were more economically efficient than small farms. However, these results are at
variance with those of Sidhu (1974) who found no
evidence of differences in the relative economic
efficiency or its components of technical and pricing
efficiency, between small and large farms. The above
suggests the need to avoid generalizations on what is

clearly a complex issue. Owing to major differences
in agricultural and institutional settings, evidence
from the aforementioned studies in Asia cannot be
used directly for informing agrarian policy in Africa.
However, there is a dearth of studies in Africa that
test for relative economic efficiency (Saleem, 1988)
by farm size in order to guide policy decision makers. Data limitations have largely precluded such
analysis, most especially in West Africa (Lele and
Agarwal, 1989). The objective of this paper is to test
for relative economic efficiency differences between
small and large rice farms in Cote d 'Ivoire using the
profit function approach. The purpose of this paper
differs from that of Deininger and Binswanger
( 1995), in that while they focused on generating
plausible hypotheses for the existence of dual farm
size agrarian structures, our aim is to determine
whether differences in economic efficiency by farm
size exist in Cote d'Ivoire, the existence of dual farm
size agrarian structure taken as given (Widner, 1993).
There is an on-going debate in Cote d'Ivoire on
the types of institutional changes needed to stimulate
rice production in the country (Cooperation Fran~aise
de Developpement, 1993). With declining national
rice self-sufficiency, Cote d'Ivoire has become the
second largest importer of rice in West Africa (average of 284200 t annually in 1988-1990) (West
Africa Rice Development Association, 1993). This
has again led some policy makers to argue in favor
of increasing domestic production through the encouragement of large farms. The argument for such
an approach is that it lowers extension and input
distribution costs, and ensures easier and lower marketing costs with fewer producers. Although about
80% of rice farms in the country are smallholder
farms, the government has over the years encouraged
large farms through the importation and distribution
of highly subsidized mechanized equipment, seed
and chemical inputs. For example, the government
established large, fully mechanized, and highly subsidized upland rice farms in the northern part of the
country. The state has also given preferential tax
exemptions for the import of large machinery
(Kouadio and Pokou, 1991). The lack of empirical
studies on the relative economic efficiency of large
and small farms in Cote d'Ivoire makes it difficult
for policy makers in Cote d'Ivoire to evaluate their
agrarian policy for achieving growth and equity.

2. Empirical analysis
2.1. Empirical model
Using the output price as the numeraire, the normalized restricted profit function ( 1T *(q, Z)) can be
written in a generalized form as
7T

*(

q,Z)

=

F[ X 1* ( q,Z) ... ,Xn* ( q,Z)]
m

- L
j~

(1)

qjX/ ( q,Z)
I

where q. represents the normalized factor prices, F
is a well behaved production function, X is the
vector of variable inputs and Z is the vector of fixed
inputs used in the production process. Starting with
any well specified normalized restricted profit function, direct application of Hottelings-Shephard' s
Lemmas to the function yields the corresponding
factor demand and output supply equations

j= 1, ... ,m

(2)

Multiplying both sides by q/1T * gives a series of

m factor share equations

( 37T * ( q,Z)jaqJ

=-X/ q/7T *=a./
(3)

j=1, ... ,m

Eqs. (1) and (3) form a theoretical basis for the
specifications of the empirical models. Following
Lau and Yotopoulos ( 1971 ), the empirical specification of the system of equations of the normalized
restricted profit function and the factor share equations is given as
2

used including family and hired labor; w 1 is the
wage rate normalized by the price of output; w 2 is
the price of fertilizer normalized by the price of
paddy; X 2 is the quantity of fertilizer used; Z 1 is the
capital input and is the sum of costs of seeds,
insecticides, herbicides, animal and mechanical
power; Z 2 is the land input, which is the net area
sown to rice in hectares; DL is a dummy variable
taking on the value of unity for large farms; Ds is a
dummy variable taking on the value of unity for
small farms; R 1 is a district dummy 1• Other variables included in the profit function equation are use
of improved rice varieties ( MV ), whether or not the
farmer is educated (EDUC: defined as having had at
least 6 years of schooling, the least required for
literacy in the country), contact with extension (EXT)
and access to credit (CRDT). The inclusion of education in the profit function derives from the findings
of earlier studies (Sidhu and Baanate, 1981; Jamison
and Lau, 1982; Pudasaini, 1983) that education has a
positive effect on profits, a result that indicates the
existence of management related inefficiency (Ali
and Byerlee, 1991). Inclusion of the extension variable in the profit function follows studies that have
shown that extension contacts by farmers have a
positive influence on their farm management ability
and technical efficiency (Bindlish and Evenson,
1993). The use of modem varieties (MV) is expected to have a positive effect on profits given the
higher productivity potentials of these varieties
(Sidhu, 1974).
It is assumed that the errors of the system of
equations are additive with zero mean and finite
variance. For the same farm, the co-variance of the
error terms in these equations are non-zero, while the
co-variance of error terms of any of the equations for
different farms is assumed to be zero. Given these
assumptions, and following previous studies (Y otopoulos and Lau, 1973; Sidhu, 1974; Saleem, 1988),
Zellner's seemingly unrelated regression (SUR)

i= 1,2
where 1T * is the normalized profit in FCFA (FCFA
520 = $US1), defined as revenue less variable costs
normalized by the price of paddy ( p ); A* is the
intercept; X 1 is the number of man-days of labor

1 Pooling of date across regions to enhance price variability in
data sets has precedence in several of the studies on profit
function applications (Lau and Yotopoulos, 1971; Tamin, 1979;
Lau et a!., 1979). As in previous studies we introduce a regional
dummy variable.

method was used to estimate the system of equations
in order to obtain asymptotically efficient parameter
estimates. The efficiency of the estimates can be
further improved by imposing appropriate restrictions on the parameters in the system of equations.

2.2. Data
Data used to estimate the model were collected
from August 1992 to April 1993 from a sample of
410 rice farms in villages in three districts of northem Cote d'Ivoire, namely Touba (67 farms), Korhogo (216 farms) and Katiola (127 farms). This
provided us with disaggregated micro-level data 2 •
The definition of farm size has been variable in the
efficiency literature, as what is considered 'large' or
'small' is relative depending on the agricultural system settings. In Pakistan agriculture, Khan and Maki
( 1979) classified large farms as those having 12.5
acres or over (i.e. 5 ha). Using Indian data, Yotopoulos and Lau (1973) and Sidhu (1974) classified
'large' farms as those with at least 10 acres (i.e. 4
ha). In this study, large farms were defined as farms
that have at least 5 ha. In their study in northern Cote
d'Ivoire, Kouadio and Pokou (1991) noted that average farm size of the large farms ranged from 5 to 28
ha, with a mean of 10 ha. To determine the robustness of conclusions from the initial analysis, we shall
also examine the effects of re-defining the threshold
for large farms to 10 ha. Sensitivity of the conclusions to alternate definitions of the threshold, although very important given the potential far-reaching implications of the results of farm efficiency
tests, is rarely evaluated (Khan and Maki, 1979).

2 The use of data from the districts also enhanced variability in
the price data. We find the succinct argument of Sevilla-Siero
(1991) (p. 125) highly relevant here: "[A]s soon as we bring into
the analysis spatial considerations (and agriculture in most developing countries is par excellence a geographically dispersed activity) we see locational differences in fanngate prices ....Thus depending on their location, farms will confront different constellations of output and input prices. Paradoxically, it is the wide
geographic dispersion characteristic of developing country agriculture (and the geographic price variablity occasioned by it) that
renders feasible the estimation of profit functions therein".

3. Empirical results

3.1. Hypothesis testing
The estimated results of the profit function and
factor share equations for the efficiency tests are
given in Table 1. The parameter estimates all have
the expected signs. The input prices all have the
theoretically expected negative signs indicating that
the estimated profit function is convex in input prices.
The coefficient on capital input is positive as expected, which agrees with the finding of Khan and
Maki (1979). In the model of Yotopoulos and Lau
(1973), the coefficient on the capital variable was
found to be negatively signed due to what the authors described as mis-specification of this variable.
Although extension (EXT) and education (EDUC)
positively influence profits, their effects are not significant. However, access to credit (CRDT) and use
of modem varieties ( MV) are positively related to
profits and are generally significant.
Efficiency has three components: technical, allocative and economic. Technical efficiency can be
defined as the ability to achieve a higher level of
output, given a similar level of production inputs.
Allocative efficiency defines the extent to which
farmers make efficient decisions by using inputs up
to the level at which their marginal contribution to
output value is equal to the factor cost. Economic
efficiency combines technical and allocative efficiency. Technical and allocative efficiency are necessary, and when they occur together are sufficient
conditions for achieving economic efficiency. In order to address the questions of relative efficiency
discussed above, we carried out the following statistical tests:
H1: small and large rice farms have equal relative
economic efficiency;
H2: there is equal relative price efficiency with
respect to labor and fertilizer for small and large
rice farms;
H3: there is equal relative technical and price
efficiency for small and large rice farms;
H4: if either H1 or H2 is rejected, H4 tests for
absolute price efficiency of the large farms;
H5: if either H1 or H2 is rejected, H5 tests for
absolute price efficiency of the small farms;

A.A. Adesina, K.K. Djato /Agricultural Economics 14 ( 1996) 93-102

H6: maintaining the hypothesis of equal relative
price efficiency, this hypothesis tests for the absolute price efficiency of both large and small farms
(i.e. as a group);
H7: this hypothesis tests for constant returns to
scale in all factors of production.
We tested the relevant hypotheses under the two
alternative specification of the farm size threshold.
Hl-H5 were tested from the unrestricted model,

97

while H6 was tested with two parameter restrictions.
For H7, four restrictions were imposed on the parameters. The test results are shown in Table 2. The
results for the model variant for the case of the 5 ha
threshold are discussed first. Hl cannot be rejected.
This indicates that small and large farms have equal
relative economic efficiency. H2 is rejected, suggesting that differences exist in the relative price efficiency between small and large farms. H3 is re-

jected, which is not surprising given the result of H2.
H4 cannot be rejected for large farms, suggesting
that large farms have absolute price efficiency. H5 is
rejected for small farms. H6 is rejected, again not
surprising given that H2 has been rejected. H7 is
rejected. 13 ~ + 13; < I suggests that technology on
the farms exhibits decreasing returns to scale. Next
we discuss the results of the tests for the case where
the farm size threshold was I 0 ha. As for the 5 ha
scenario above, HI cannot be rejected, strongly supporting the above conclusion that small and large
farms have equal relative economic efficiency. H2
cannot be rejected, suggesting that small and large
farms have equal relative price efficiency. H3 cannot
be rejected, indicating that small and large farms
have equal relative technical and price efficiency. H4
cannot be rejected, but H5 is rejected, results which
together appear to indicate that large farms have
absolute price efficiency. H6 was rejected, indicating
that as a group, there exists absolute price inefficiency among all rice farms in the sample. H7 is
rejected, supporting the conclusion of decreasing
returns to scale for the technology use on all the rice
farms. When all the results are taken together, there
is certainly evidence that when account is taken of
differences in access to extension, use of modem
varieties, credit and education, there are no differ-

ences in relative economic efficiency between small
and large rice farms in Cote d'lvoire.

3.2. Elasticity estimates and implications
An issue of central interest to policy makers is the
responsiveness of output supply and factor demands
to price policy, and how they are affected by investment and land policies (Lau and Yotopoulos, I979).
Such estimates are lacking for rice in Cote d'Ivoire.
An advantage of the profit function approach is that
it permits straightforward derivation of own-price
and cross-price output supply and input demand
elasticities. Indirect estimates of production elasticities were derived from identities which link the
coefficients of the profit function and those of the
production function. It has been noted that these
indirect input elasticities, when compared with those
obtained from the production function, have the distinct advantage of statistical consistency (Sidhu,
197 4). These estimates of indirect elasticities are
compared with direct elasticity estimates obtained
from an estimated production function. All elasticities have the expected signs. The elasticity of rice
output is highest for labor (0.408) followed by fertilizer (0.267), land (0.204) and capital (0.036).
To examine the output and factor demand respon-

fications of farm size (i.e. under 5 ha and 10 ha),
using the unrestricted parameter estimates. These
elasticities, given in Tables 3-5, are compared with
estimates obtained by previous studies on rice farms
in Asia. The elasticity estimates from the two alternate model specifications are very similar, buttressing the robustness of the predicted estimates. The
rice supply response to changes in paddy price is
slightly inelastic (Table 3). The output supply elasticities with respect to land (0.69) and capital (0.15)
indicate the output response of an average farm to
increases in land and capital, holding wage rate (not
quantity of labor) and fertilizer price (not quantity of
fertilizer) constant. Increasing the amounts of land
and capital will shift the marginal productivity curves
of labor and fertilizer upwards. The implication is
that, holding wage rate and fertilizer price constant, a
1% increase in amount of rice land will result in a
0.7% increase in rice output and a 1% increase in
capital will result in a 0.2% increase in rice output.
The inelastic own-price paddy supply elasticity, and
the inelastic paddy supply elasticity with respect to
the fixed factors, may be due to the lack of improved
rice technologies which limits increases in land productivity. The highly elastic demand for fertilizer

(Table 4) with respect to paddy price (1.97-2.03)
indicates that increases in paddy prices would lead to
significant increase in farmers' demand for fertilizers
to intensify rice production. However, the highly
elastic own-price elasticity of fertilizer demand
(- 1.43 to - 1.53) suggests that increases in fertilizer prices would lead to substantial reduction in
fertilizer usage. The estimated highly elastic labor
demand elasticity (1.97-2.03) with respect to paddy
price (Table 5) indicates that increases in paddy
prices will lead to a substantial increase in labor
absorption in the highly labor-intensive rice farms.
Similarly, the highly elastic own-price labor demand
elasticity (- 1.6) indicates that exogenously enforced
government intervention in the rural labor market to
raise (lower) rural wage rates for agricultural labor
above (below) the market determined rates would
have major effects on the labor intensive rice production systems by creating major decline (increase) in
labor absorption in rice production.

4. Conclusions
In this paper we examined the relative economic
efficiency of small and large rice farms in Cote

d'Ivoire using a profit function approach. We found
no difference in the economic efficiency of small
and large farms. This conclusion is robust under
alternative model specifications. A number of agrarian policy implications for the rice sector of Cote
d'Ivoire can be drawn from the findings. The most
substantive is that agrarian reforms directed towards
further concentration of landholding for large farms
cannot be justified based on economic efficiency.
Such programs can only be justified from the perspective of political considerations that often favor
the elitist social class that control much of the large
scale farms in Cote d'Ivoire (Widner, 1993). At
times, the government has taken steps to mechanize
rice production through direct land appropriation and
re-distribution to form large scale farms. However,
economic studies of large-scale fully mechanized
rice projects in northern Cote d'lvoire (i.e. Grand
Travaux, Projet Soja) show very high economic
losses (Berger et al., 1990). The preference for a
large-farm led approach to rice production is a bias
not supported by any evidence of superior economic
efficiency of large farms.
Secondly, results show that within the dualistic
farm size agrarian structure in Cote d'Ivoire, there
exists evidence of absolute allocative inefficiency.
Policy interventions are needed to remove such management related inefficiencies in rice production either through the development of a better market
price information system or effective farmer-oriented
technical training programs by rice extension workers.
Finally, results indicate that access to credit and
use of modem rice varieties significantly increase
profits. Several improved rice varieties are available
in Cote d'lvoire, but many farms do not have access
to them because of poor seed distribution service,
and ineffectiveness of the extension service. To improve technical efficiency of rice farms, a more
accelerated program to provide information, credit,
improved seeds and other inputs is needed. The
recent establishment of a consolidated rural development agency (ONADER: Organization Nationale
d' Appui au Developpement Rural e) will be instrumental in providing farmers access to these inputs.
Our results strongly suggest that government policies
on such farm support services should not be biased
against smallholder rice farms.
