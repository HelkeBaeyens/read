Abstract

This paper uses a flexible (translog) production function to estimate efficiency of 227 farms from West Bengal,
India. We consider estimation of technical and allocative inefficiencies using a profit maximising framework which
accommodates both endogenous and exogenous inputs. The maximum likelihood method of estimation developed in
this paper is based on the production function and the first-order conditions of profit maximisation. Farm-specific
technical and allocative inefficiencies are also estimated. Empirical results show that the mean level of technical
efficiency is 75.46% while the best farm is 85.87% efficient (technically). So far as allocative efficiency is concerned
the majority of the farms are found to be under-users of the endogenous inputs, viz., fertiliser, manure, human and
bullock labour.

1. Introduction

The neoclassical theory of production is based
on the notion of efficiency. This idea is emphasised in the textbook definition of a production
function which gives the maximum possible output for given quantities of inputs. One problem
with the notion of 'maximum' is that nobody can
recognise it simply by observing the actual level
of output unless the observed output is assumed
to be the maximum. Such an assumption is not
realistic since different producers do produce different levels of output even if they use the same
level of every observed input. One way of explaining the difference in observed outputs among
producers is through differences in productive
efficiency. In the frontier approach a producer is

said to be technically efficient 1 if the observed
output is maximum, given the input quantities.
Thus, the production frontier is defined as the
locus of maximum possible outputs for each level
of input use. A failure on the part of the farm to
produce the frontier level of output, given the
input quantities, is attributed to technical inefficiency.

1 The concept of technical efficiency goes back to Farrell
(1957). Another concept of efficiency is Leibenstien's X-efficiency (1966), which is often associated with poor quality or
poorly trained/motivated labour force, lack of managerial
effort, etc. In the context of farming, soil characteristics,
climatic and some socio-economic factors may affect efficiency of a farm.

Technical inefficiency is not the only inefficiency. If the producer makes mistakes in allocating inputs, the resulting inefficiency is labeled as
allocative inefficiency. It is always associated with
some behavioral objective like profit maximisation or cost minimisation. Mistakes in the allocation of resources and production of suboptimal
level of output increase cost and, therefore, decrease profit. Consequently, identification of the
inefficient producers is very important, especially
for government policy designed to promote efficient utilisation of resources.
Econometric estimation of frontier functions
goes back to Aigner, Lovell and Schmidt (1977)
and Meeiisen and van den Broeck (1977). The
methodology proposed by these authors is quite
general and can accommodate any functional
form of the underlying production technology.
However, their approach is restricted to estimation of only technical inefficiency or cost therefrom. Extensions of the Aigner et al. (1977) model
to incorporate both technical and allocative inefficiencies have been made in terms of production
functions for which the cost or the profit functions can be derived explicitly from the optimising
conditions (see, for example, Schmidt and Lovell,
1979, 1980; Kumbhakar, 1987, 1988). The major
advantage of using such restrictive production
functions lies in obtaining closed form algebraic
formulae for costs of technical and allocative
inefficiencies which are of primary concern to the
producers. The disadvantage is that the production functions for which cost or profit functions
can be derived explicitly are quite restrictive in
nature.
This paper describes a method of estimating
technical and allocative inefficiencies using a
translog production function - the most widely
used flexible functional form in applied works.
Estimating a translog production function with
inefficiency was first proposed by Greene (1980).
He assumed, at least implicitly, the inputs to be
exogenous or predetermined. The problem with
such an assumption is that allocative inefficiency
from suboptimal input use cannot arise since the
use of input levels are no longer a choice variable.
In this paper, we depart from the Greene

formulation by including endogenous and exogenous inputs. The endogenous inputs are chosen
to maximise expected value of profit. Since the
input demand and output supply functions cannot
be derived explicitly, the parameters are estimated from the system of equations consisting of
the production function and the first-order conditions of expected profit maximisation using the
Maximum Likelihood (ML) method. Estimation
of technical and allocative inefficiencies for each
observation is also considered. The proposed
method is applied to estimate efficiency of 227
farms in West Bengal, India.
Organisation of the rest of the paper is as
follows. Section 2 gives an overview of efficiency
studies in Indian agriculture. This is followed by
the econometric model. Section 4 describes the
data and the results are reported in Section 5.
Conclusion and remarks are in Section 6.

2. Efficiency measures in Indian agriculture

Previous studies on efficiency of Indian farms
can be classified broadly into the following three
categories. First, studies based on the primal approach where the parameters were directly estimated mostly by using the ordinary least squares
(OLS) method. These parameter estimates were
then used to check whether the first order conditions of profit maximisation are satisfied (see, for
example, Hopper, 1965; Sahota, 1968; Saini,
1979). Attempts were also made to model these
deviations in terms of observable factors like education, experience, etc. (Ram, 1980). In the second category of studies, profit maximising behavior was explicitly taken into account by estimating
the dual profit function. Again efficiency was
modeled as a function of farm characteristics like
size of land holding (Lau and Yotopoulos, 1971;
Yotopoulos and Lau, 1973), size and form of
tenancy (Junankar, 1980), variety of crops, and
the degree of mechanisation (Sidhu, 1974). Finally, in recent years the frontier methodology of
Aigner et al. (1977) was used by Huang and Bagi
(1984), Huang (1984) and Kalirajan and Shand
(1985), among others.

The present study follows the last approach,
i.e., it uses the stochastic frontier method to
estimate economic efficiency of farms in West
Bengal, India. We extend the results of previous
studies by incorporating allocative inefficiency together with technical inefficiency in a translog
production function. This extension has two major advantages. First, in contrast to the previous
frontier studies, we do not assume all inputs to be
exogenous or predetermined. Instead, we include
both exogenous and endogenous inputs in our
analysis. Moreover, the assumption that the endogenous inputs are independent of technical
inefficiency is not made. Second, we use a system
of simultaneous equations to avoid possible bias
that might arise due to the presence of the endogenous inputs and their correlations with technical inefficiency. 2 By including the first-order
conditions of profit maximisation in the estimation process we hope to get more efficient parameter estimates.

3. Econometric model
It is well known that the production technology can be estimated by either the primal (direct)
or the dual (indirect) approach. In the dual approach, one starts with a profit or cost function
which can be directly estimated. Additional information can be obtained by using HotellingShephard's lemma. 3 In this paper we use the
primal approach where estimation of the produc-

One can also avoid the endogeneity problem by estimating a
profit function. Since the input and output prices are exogenous, consistent estimator of the parameters is obtained using
a single-equation technique. There are, however, two problems associated with estimating a profit function. First, estimation of profit function requires price variability which might
be a problem in a cross-sectional data (see, e.g., Junankar,
1989). Second, separating costs of technical and allocative
inefficiencies (in terms of foregone profit) from a profit function is not always possible. Since our objective is to estimate
both technical and allocative inefficiencies, we decided not to
pursue the profit function approach in this study.
3 Application of some of these models can be found in
Cowing et al. (1983), Kopp and Diewert (1982) and Greene
(1980). See also Schmidt (1985) for a critique of this approach.

tion function is the main locus. Additional equations from the first-order conditions of profit
maximisation are also used to make the model
consistent in terms of the number of endogenous
variables being equal to the number of equations.
The production function is assumed to be represented by a translog form, which with both endogenous and exogenous inputs is written as:
In Y=a 0 +a' In X+8' In Z+t In X'B In X
+tlnZ'AlnZ
+ In

X'~

In Z +

T

+v

( 1)

where Y is output, X and Z are n X 1 and m X 1
vectors of endogenous and quasi-fixed inputs, respectively. The B and A matrices are square
(n X n and m X m, respectively) and symmetric
whereas the ~ matrix is of order n X m. These
matrices contain all second-order coefficients.
The first-order coefficients are contained in a
and 8 vectors. The symbol v represents a random
disturbance that captures exogenous shocks to
the producer. Since these shocks can both be
favourable and unfavourable, v is allowed to take
positive and negative values. On the other hand,
technical inefficiency, T, is represented by a nonpositive random variable; T = 0 defines the production frontier which gives the maximum possible output given X and Z. The frontier is
stochastic because of the presence of v. A nonzero value of T can be interpreted as the reduction in log output due to technical inefficiency.
Therefore, given the inputs X and Z, the observed differences in output levels can be attributed to either technical inefficiency or random shocks or both. Similarly, the observed differences in (endogenous) input use, even if input
prices are the same for all farms, can be explained in terms of differences in quasi-fixed inputs, and the presence of technical and allocative
inefficiencies (defined in Eq. 2 below).
Since the inputs X are endogenous, we have
to introduce additional equations for consistency
of the model. These equations are obtained from
the optimising behavior of the producer. We assume that the objective of the producer is to
maximise profit (conditional on its technical inefficiency) subject to the production function in (1).

In deriving the necessary conditions of profit
maximisation (given technical inefficiency, T) we
assume that the effect of exogenous shocks v is
unknown.
Since profit is random due to the fact that v is
unknown, we follow expected profit maximisation
criterion due to Zellner, Kmenta and Dreze
(1966). The first-order conditions of expected
profit maximisation can be written as:

W;

where P is the output price and W; is the price of
input i; ui is interpreted as allocative inefficiency
in the use of input i (Kumbhakar, 1987). If ui > 0
( < 0), the ith input is used more (less) than its
optimum level, given W; and P. In other words,
any deviation of the value of marginal product of
an input from its price is attributed to errors in
the allocation of input (allocative inefficiency). 4

Where Ef = Tf + Vf, YJj = ljf + t Tf, ljf =

denotes farms, f = 1, 2, ... , F.) These are:
- U is multivariate normal with zero mean and
constant covariance I, and it is distributed
independently and identically over farms.
- v is i.i.d. N(O, a}).
- The distribution of T is the non-positive portion of an i.i.d. N(O, a/) variable.
- v and T are independent of each other and are
are also independent of the elements of the U

Eqs. (1) and (3) constitute a system of (n + 1)
equations in In Y and In X 1 , ••• , In Xn. Since
these equations are highly nonlinear, closed-form
solution of In Y and In Xi, i.e., output supply and
input demand functions, cannot be obtained.
However, consistent estimators of the parameters
can be obtained from the ML method without
deriving the input demand and output supply
functions explicitly. Furthermore, estimators of T
and ui can also be obtained for each observation.

One can separate input-specific allocative inefficiency (u;l

4. Data

The data set used in the present study has
been collected by the Agro-Economic Research
Centre 6 from three regions of the Indian state of
West Bengal. These regions cover the entire
paddy production belt of West Bengal. A crosssection random sample of 227 household farms
has been selected for the present study. The
survey was conducted during 1980-1985. Since
different regions were surveyed in different years,
it is not a panel. Over the last two decades, the

advent of technological changes, introduction of
high yielding seeds, security of land tenure, availability of production loans, relaxation of government control over purchase of output and sale of
some vital factors (fertilisers, irrigation water,
pesticides), etc., have made the agricultural production system very much market oriented. Under such an environment, use of the profit maximisation hypothesis on the part of the producers
as a maintained hypothesis seems appropriate.
The agricultural production activities of the
state of West Bengal are spread over at least two
crop seasons. Here we consider the monsoon
paddy as our subject of investigation. 7 This choice
is due to the fact that monsoon paddy is produced by all farms in the region under investigation. Moreover, during this season, markets for
the inputs become quite competitive.
Output (Y) is measured in quintals (100 kg) of
paddy. The endogenous inputs are: fertiliser (F),
manure (M), human labour (N) and bullock labour
(B). We treat land (L) and capital (K) as quasifixed inputs. The human labour includes both
family labour and hired labour and is measured
in hours. Bullock labour is also measured in hours.
Fertiliser and manure are measured in kg. Land
is measured in acres. Prices of paddy, fertiliser,
manure, labour and bullock labour are all measured in Indian rupees.
The capital variable used here is a weighted
average of rental value of services from irrigation
and other farm equipment. The land under cultivation has been used as a quasi-fixed input because its market is not well developed especially
in leasing out. It is measured in acres and it
includes the area under monsoon paddy only.
Productivity differences due to different types
of soil, terrain, weather and land sizes are controlled by including regional and farm-size dummy
variables in the production function. We hope
that these regional dummies will capture the differential effects of soil, terrain and weather since
we do not have data on these variables.

7 Data on input usage are related to the production of paddy
only. Inputs used other than in paddy are not considered
here.

find RTS to be equal to 0.9898 at the normalized
data point.
The production function is said to be well
behaved if it is monotonically increasing and concave in input quantities. Monotonicity is satisfied
since the estimated input cost shares (cost of
input as a ratio of total value of output) are
found to be positive. Concavity is checked by
verifying the negative semidefiniteness of the matrix:

the above matrix is found to be negative semidefinite.
Technical efficiency for each farm is calculated
as TE = Y /Ymax = exp( T ), where the estimate of T
is obtained from (6). This measure of technical
efficiency is called output augmenting since it
suggests that actual output is below the frontier
output by [1 - exp( T )] X 100%. Alternatively, output could be increased by [1 - exp( T )] X 100% if
the farm becomes technically efficient. The frequency distribution of TE is reported in Table 2.
None of the farms in the sample is fully technically efficient. The mean efficiency of these farms
is 75.46%; the maximum is 85.87% and the minimum 55.45%. Thus, potential output of these
farms, given their input usage, is much higher.

From the view point of a resource scarce economy these findings have obvious policy implication. By improving technical efficiency of these
farms, output could be increased, on average, by
24.54%. 8
In Table 3 we report the level of technical
efficiency by region and farm size. To conserve
space only the mean, maximum and minimum
values are included. The mean efficiency levels
are very similar across regions and size groups
but not the minimum values. This difference in
the distribution of technical efficiency is also reflected in the standard deviations (reported in the
last column of Table 3). It can be seen that the
small farms are more efficient (higher mean values and smaller standard deviations). However,
the best farm in the small size group is not more
efficient than those in the medium and large size
groups.

Two alternative models, viz., a single-equation translog
model and a simultaneous equation Cobb-Douglas (CD)
model, were also considered. About 90% of the parameters
were found to be statistically insignificant in the first model.
Because of this we did not pursue the single-equation translog
model further. The CD model is a special case of the translog
model considered in this study. We, therefore, test the restric·
tions for the CD model using the likelihood ratio test. The
test rejects the CD specification at the 1% level of signifi·
cance. The distribution of technical efficiency generated from
this model shows much greater variability - ranging from 20%
to 87% with a mean value of 67.13%. Since this model is
rejected by the data, we decided not to report the results in
details.

are not surprised by the above results on technical efficiency. The mean level of technical efficiency is comparable to other similar studies. 9
There are, however, certain factors which can
affect the estimate of technical efficiency. First,
since we are dealing with cross sectional data,
farm-specific factors cannot be controlled. Thus,
unobserved farm effects are confounded with
technical efficiency. As a result, farms which are
found to be most inefficient might not be so if
individual effects are controlled. This can be done
only when panel data are available [see, for example, Kumbhakar and Hjalmarsson (1993) for such
an application]. Second, the role of non-physical
inputs like experience, information, supervision,
etc., might influence the ability of a producer to
use the available technology efficiently. These
factors are not taken into account because of
non-availability of such information in the present data.
To compose a management index that describes how management is reflected in the level
of input utilisation, we run an auxiliary regression
of technical efficiency, which can be used as an
index of 'management', on all of the inputs. 10
The results show positive correlation between
technical efficiency and (endogenous) input use.
In other words, an inefficient farm tends to use
less of every (endogenous) input and produce less
output (Kumbhakar, 1987). This finding suggests
that:
- The OLS results based on the production function without the management variable are biased.
- Even if technical inefficiency is introduced into
the analysis [as in Huang and Bagi (1984),
Huang (1984), Kalirajan and Shand (1985),
among others], the assumption that technical
inefficiency is independent of the inputs is
inappropriate. Consequently, the parameter
estimates are inconsistent if the production
function alone is used in estimation.
See the survey by Battese (1992) and the references cited
there for a variety of applications in agricultural economics
using data from different countries.
10 This regression "does not explain what determines the
performance of the management" (see Mundlak, 1961, p. 49).

In view of the 'belief' that there is an inverse
relation between land size and productivity in
Indian agriculture, we looked at the coefficient of
the land variable in the auxiliary regression. The
coefficient is negative and statistically significant.
This finding supports previous results that small
farms are technically more efficient. 11
Now we examine whether these farms are using their inputs efficiently by calculating allocative inefficiency for each farm from (3), viz.

where Y *, S * and a}, T are to be replaced by
their estimates. A zero value of u; means that the
input i is efficiently used whereas a negative
(positive) value means under-utilisation (overutilisation). 12 In view of this, we separate positive and negative values of u for each input and
report their mean values in Table 4. The distribution of farms is shown by their percentages in
each category. Table 4 shows a clear pattern of
input use. Under-utilisation of the inputs is a
common problem to most of these farms: 53.75%
underutilised fertiliser and 62.56% underutilised
manure. The percentage of farms underutilising
human and bullock labour are 57.71 and 55.95,
respectively.
These results on allocative inefficiency seem to
contradict the Schultz hypothesis (1964) that Indian farms are poor but allocatively efficient.
Schultz, like Hopper (1965), calculated allocative
(in)efficiency for the whole sample, not for individual farms. Thus, to relate our results to those
of Schultz, one has to look at the mean values of
u; which are very close to zero. This is what
Schultz's conclusion is. Thus, in the aggregate

11 See Saini (1979, chapter 7) for a review of some of these
studies. It is, however, to be noted that the present methodology is econometrically much more sophisticated and rigorous.
12 It is to be noted that the idea of allocative efficiency used
here is based on the profit maximisation hypothesis. Since the
profit maximising behavior is embedded into the model, it is
not possible to test the profit maximisation hypothesis as such
(Junankar, 1980).

level our results do not contradict the Schultz
hypothesis.
However, it is to be noted that the concept of
efficiency is essentially micro. One cannot draw
any conclusion regarding allocative efficiency of
individual farms from the aggregates. Our results
on allocative inefficiency are based on individual
farms. In reporting these results we grouped farms
as under- (over-)user of inputs and calculated
their mean values. What is interesting here is that
one can look at the magnitude of these values for
each input and farm to identify those which are
under- or over-user of a particular input. The
aggregative picture conceals such information.
From a policy point of view, the main advantage
of this type of micro analysis is that it gives some
information about the inefficient farms to the
policy makers so that outside help of experts may
be directed to those who need it most.
The estimates of allocative inefficiency, presented here, are subject to two caveats. First, the
use of the risk neutral assumption where farms
are risk averse may result in 'apparent allocative
inefficiency'. The present study implicitly assumes
risk neutral behavior while using the expected
profit maximisation behavior where only the output variable is uncertain. Under risk averse behavior the first order condition is:
£ ( U 1 ( 7T) [ p

:;i - ~])

=

0

where U( 7T) is utility from profit, 7T, and U
is
the first derivative of U( · ). The second derivative
of U( · ), U( · )", is assumed to be negative (zero)
for risk-averse (risk-neutral) behavior. Thus, the

condition under risk neutrality [U"( ·) = 0 or

(12)

which is the first-order condition of expected
profit maximisation in (3) without allocative inefficiency (u; = 0). Since the solution of X; from
(11) is less than that of X; from (12), the estimates of input over-utilisation will be biased upward if risk-neutral behavior is imposed when
producers are risk-averse. Second, the output and
input markets may not be competitive as assumed. In the Indian context one may cite government intervention in the input markets, e.g.,
fertiliser and labour markets as well as in the
output market. The presence of such restrictions
distorts prices which may result in 'apparent allocative inefficiency'.

6. Conclusion and remarks

The main contribution of this paper is in the
use of a flexible (translog) production function in
estimating technical and allocative efficiencies using farm-level data from West Bengal, India. We
used the expected profit maximisation criterion
which accommodates both endogenous and exogenous (quasi-fixed) inputs and estimated both
technical and allocative inefficiencies for each
farm. The possibility of bias or inconsistency in
parameter estimates resulting from correlation of
technical inefficiency and input use is eliminated
by using a simultaneous equation approach instead of a single equation method.
The empirical results show that there is substantial scope for improving technical efficiency
of these farms. None of the farms in our sample
is fully technically efficient. The most efficient
farm is about 14% below the production frontier.
We also find that technical efficiency is positively
correlated with fertiliser, manure, labour and bullock labour but negatively with land size. The last
result shows that small farms are more efficient
(technically). This finding is important so far as
the land reform policy of the government is con-

!51

cerned. Concerning allocative inefficiency, we find
that more than 50% of the farms in our sample
under-utilise fertiliser, manure, labour and bullock labour. The extent of under-use, however,
varies from farm to farm. This phenomenon of
inefficient use of inputs may be due to distortions
in the input and output markets resulting from
government regulations as well as social and cultural constraints. Imperfect market conditions
may also be responsible for this misallocation.
The present research can be extended in several ways. First, factors like land size, land tenure,
credit availability, education, extension services,
etc., may be introduced to explain differences in
technical and allocative efficiencies. Second, if
the product and factor markets are not competitive because of government regulations, social
and cultural barriers, etc., or some of the factors
are immobile and farms are risk averse, imposition of the expected profit maximisation (risk
neutrality) hypothesis may lead to erroneous conclusions, especially regarding allocative inefficiency. Finally, availability of panel data would be
helpful to control for farm-specific effects which
cannot be separated from technical inefficiency
using cross sectional data. We hope to address
some of these issues in the future.
