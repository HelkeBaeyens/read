Abstract
The impacts of the Uruguay Round policy provisions on the world sugar market show that these policies will stabilize the world sugar
price at slightly higher levels than in the baseline. Global sugar consumption will increase as a result of the income growth caused by the
Uruguay Round. Economic resources will be allocated more efficiently among the sugar industries of the various countries. However, the
impacts on the sugar industries in countries with strong producer supports will be rather small because the negotiation process of the
Uruguay Round has accommodated the changes in sugar policies already implemented by individual countries in the past few years.
Low-cost sugar producing countries will benefit from the higher world sugar price, and consumers in countries with protected markets will
benefit from lower domestic prices.

1. Introduction

Sugar is an important commodity in the world
market with a total production of 115.79 million t,
consumption of 111.15 million t, and world trade
equal to 27% of production in 1992. Sugar is produced in more than 100 countries and is one of the
most heavily traded commodities. The international
sugar market has several unique characteristics that
distinguish it from other commodity markets. Among
these are heavy government interventions, large price
volatility, widespread production in many parts of
the world, and a growing market for sugar substitutes. These features make the world sugar market a
rich target for policy analysis, although they also
pose considerable modeling difficulties.

Sugar is derived from sugarcane and sugarbeet.
Sugarcane is mostly grown in tropical climates and
low-income countries, and sugarbeet is predominantly grown in temperate climates and high-income
countries. Sugar is, therefore, produced in sizeable
quantities in many parts of the world. The cost of
sugar production is relatively lower in the low-income countries than in the high-income countries.
Furthermore, most of these countries compete directly in the world market. Consequently, the developed countries in the northern hemisphere heavily
protect domestic producers, often at the expense of
domestic consumers. Webb et al. (1990) estimated
that in 1987, 67% of sugar producers' income in
Japan, 60% in the United States, 54% in Canada, and
41% in the European Union was derived from government subsidies and price supports. Ives and Hurley ( 1988) noted that the US sugar programs maintain the domestic price at a much higher level than
the free-market price at a cost to US consumers of

over $3 billion annually. Borrell and Duncan (1993)
also concluded that the total cost to US consumers
over the 1982-1988 period was about $2.5 billion
annually. Roberts and Whish-Wilson (1991) estimated that the European Union's sugar policies during the period 1979-1989 imposed an annual implicit cost on consumers of about $3.8 billion. Sturgiss et al. (1988) estimated that Japanese sugar policies during 1985-1987 cost the consumers about
$2.3 billion annually.
The sugar policies of developed countries also
inflicted significant economic loss on low-income
sugar exporters as these countries experienced lower
world prices and production, and displacement of
employment opportunities. For example, Borrell and
Duncan ( 1993) predicted that the combined effects
of the sugar policies of the United States, the European Union, and Japan could depress the world price
by 33% and increase world price variability by 28%.
Ives and Hurley (1988) predicted that, because of
reduction in the volume of the US import quota in
1987, countries exporting sugar to the United States
incurred a loss in export earnings of over $700
million annually. Borrell and Duncan (1993) also
provide estimates of individual exporting country's
losses inflicted by the United States, the European
Union, and Japan. Evidence from such studies lead
Marks and Maskus (1993) to conclude that: developed countries' sugar policies have ''made sugar
markets among the most egregiously distorted of all
agricultural commodity markets and have caused
significant global welfare losses.''
Because of the level of distortion in the world
sugar market, trade liberalization resulting from the
Uruguay Round (UR) of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (GATT) should lead to a significant improvement in world resource allocation by
shifting sugar production to more efficient areas and
reducing the inefficient production of com-based
sweeteners. For example, Sturgiss et al. ( 1987) found
that previous international sugar agreements to raise
and stabilize the world price through stock management were inefficient, but elimination of government
subsidies and other forms of intervention would improve world welfare.
As UR policy provisions are implemented, it is
important for the sugar exporting and importing
countries to assess the effects of these trade reforms

on their sugar markets. The objective of this study is
to empirically quantify the effects of the trade liberalization agreements negotiated under the UR on
sugar production, consumption, trade, and prices of
the major sugar exporting and importing countries.
This is accomplished by estimating a non-spatial
equilibrium model of the world sugar market consisting of 21 countries/regions. For each country, important components of supply and demand are estimated by incorporating the domestic and trade policies and modeling sugar substitutes. The results of
these trade liberalization analyses will be useful to
producers and policymakers.

2. Sugar policies and UR provisions
Among the reasons countries intervene in the
sugar market are (a) sugar production requires a
huge investment; (b) producers seek to maintain
stable prices and incomes; (c) many countries rely on
the sugar industry for employment opportunities; (d)
low-income countries generate foreign exchange from
exports; and (e) some countries pursue self-sufficiency goals because sugar is widely used in many
products. Since UR trade reforms are aimed at liberalizing the existing domestic and trade policies, a
brief review of the current policies of selected countries and the effects of the UR provisions on these
policies are provided next. The policy reviews presented in this section are drawn from Ives and
Hurley (1988), Lord and Barry (1990), and Borrell
and Duncan (1993). The detailed UR sugar policy
provisions for various countries are reported in De"
vadoss and Kropf (1995).
2.1. The United States

The major features of the US sugar programs in
the 1980s were a loan rate scheme and an import
quota system. The loan rate scheme guaranteed sugar
processors a minimum price for their sugar. The
processors in tum passed these loan rate guarantees
to beet and cane producers by paying a fixed minimum price. The loan rate was set considerably higher
than the world sugar price. The processors could
forfeit their stocks to the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) at the loan rate. Though loan forfei-

S. Devadoss, J. Kropf/ Agricultural Economics 15 ( 1996) 83-96

tures could cost the US treasury, the 1985 farm
legislation mandated that the US program should not
impose budgetary burdens on the government. This
mandate was achieved by maintaining a domestic
price higher than the loan rate and transferring the
cost of the sugar programs to consumers.
To keep processors from forfeiting their stocks to
the CCC and to prevent the domestic price from
falling below the loan rate, import quotas were enacted to limit the amount of import. Until 1990, the
US allocated these quotas among various exporting
countries. In 1990, in response to pressure from
GATT, the United States established a tariff-rate
quota system. Under this system, the United States
currently implements a country-by-country quota
with a low tariff of 0.625 c per lb. Imports above the
quota limits are charged a tariff of 16 c per lb.
Because of the relatively high domestic prices,
beet and, to some extent, cane production are expanding stronger than the level desired by the US
government. To restrict domestic production the
USDA implements a marketing allotment arrangement, which allocates the amount of sugar the millers
and processors can sell in the domestic market in a
year. The marketing allotment is triggered if the
USDA estimates show that for a given year the
projected supply will exceed demand. Specifically,
the formula used by the USDA, known as marketing
allotment import estimate (MAlE), to determine the
allotment is domestic consumption + ending stocks
< domestic production + beginning stocks + 1.250
million short tons. This program was implemented in
fiscal years 1993 and 1995. Furthermore, high price
support policies in the United States have encouraged rapid expansion of high fructose com syrup
(HFCS), displacing domestic sugar consumption.
The UR provisions for agriculture can be broadly
classified under the categories: market access, domestic support, and export competition (refer to the
appendix table in Devadoss and Kropf, 1995, for
specific policy reduction schedules by various countries). For the United States, the computed value of
the price support program is $1054 million, and the
United States is expected to apply a reduction of
20%, resulting in $843 million in price supports. The
computed sugar tariff equivalent is 39.59 c per kg
(149.40%) and the required reduction is 15%. The
US government has modified its sugar programs to

85

meet the UR requirement of reducing price supports
and tariff equivalents. The market access provision
of minimum imports does not pose a constraint since
the US imports are greater than 3% of its consumption. The export competition provision does not apply to the United States because of its limited export
capabilities.
2.2. The European Union (EU)
The major sugar policies of the EU include domestic production and price controls backed by variable import levies, export subsidies, and production
controls on high fructose starch syrup (HFSS). These
policies have led to increased sugar production. As a
result the EU has switched from a net sugar importer
to a major sugar exporter. Domestic production is
controlled by administering A and B production
quotas. Under Quota A, sugar is produced to meet
the domestic demand. Sugar produced under Quota
A qualifies for the EU intervention price, an administered price substantially higher than the world market price.
Quota B also receives the domestic price support
but faces a higher co-responsibility levy than Quota
A. Thus, the producer price for Quota B sugar equals
the intervention price minus a higher levy. Quota A
and B sugar in excess of domestic consumption is
exported with subsidies, which are financed by the
production levies on A and B sugar. Sugar produced
in excess of these quotas, termed as C sugar, receives the world price and is sold in the world
market without subsidies.
Furthermore, the EU administers threshold prices
and variable levies to protect the domestic market
from sugar imports. All these policies provide substantial support to domestic producers, but the administration of these policies is very costly. In order
to pay for these policies, the EU taxes domestic
consumers by setting the price at high levels.
For the EU, the computed aggregate measurement
of support (AMS) is 5.3 billion ECU, and the EU is
expected to apply a reduction of 20%, which results
in an· AMS of 4.2 billion ECU. To meet the AMS
requirement, the EU is expected to reduce its intervention price. The computed sugar tariff equivalent
is 524 ECU per t. A 20% reduction brings the tariff
equivalent to 419 ECU per t. The current import

86

access of 1.9 million t, mostly imported from African,
Caribbean, and Pacific (ACP) countries through the
Lome agreement, exceeds 3% of EU consumption,
and thus, the import access requirement is being met
by the EU. The computed volume of subsidized
exports is 1.6 million t and a reduction of 21 %
brings these exports to 1.3 million t. A 36% reduction in the value of subsidized exports is applied
which causes the EU export subsidies to come down
from 777 to 497 million ECU.

2.3. Australia
Australia is a sugar exporting country and ranked
third in the world in exports from 1986 to 1988.
Australia grows only sugarcane and is considered to
be a low-cost producer of sugar. Australia regulates
its sugar industry by implementing policies through a
sugar board that regulates producers as well as consumers.
The sugar board assigns sugarcane areas to producers. The sugar produced in these areas is sold for
an administratively established price. Sugar produced
from unassigned areas is acquired by the government
for a price of Aus$1 per ton, which effectively
prevents cane production in these areas. The returns
from sugar sold in the domestic and export markets
are pooled by the sugar board and distributed to
producers and mills. In the past, the return from
exports fluctuated since world sugar prices varied
markedly. Until 1989, domestic prices were fixed in
Australia and in some years were lower than the
world price. Since 1989, domestic prices are allowed
to follow the world price. The import quota, in place
before 1989, was replaced by a tariff system which
liberalized the Australian sugar market. This liberalization resulted in a market-determined consumer
price.
For Australia, the computed value of the AMS for
sugar is Aus$64. 73 million. A reduction of 20%
results in an AMS of Aus$51.8 million. The computed sugar tariff equivalent is Aus$143 per t
(149.40%) and the required reduction is 15%.
2.4. Brazil

Brazil is a sugar exporting country and a leading
producer of sugarcane. Brazil is a low-cost sugar

producer. In Brazil, sugarcane is used to produce
sugar and ethanol (which is a primary domestic fuel).
The production of both commodities is highly regulated by a quasi-government agency, the Brazilian
Institute of Sugar and Alcohol, by allocating annual
quotas to farms, mills, and refineries.
Brazilian sugar policies include the allocation of
sugarcane areas into sugar and ethanol production
areas. For example, in 1989, the ratio of ethanol to
sugar production was 60 to 40%. Other policies
include sugar export controls and determination of
producer and consumer prices. Producer prices are
fixed at a level above the world price and consumer
prices are set at a level well below the world price.
The price controls insulate domestic producers and
consumers from the world market. Brazil's ability to
switch between ethanol and sugar production is restricted because of the country's high dependency on
ethanol production as a vehicular fuel. Nevertheless,
Brazil has an enormous sugarcane production capacity that allows the country to increase sugar production and exports in response to rising world sugar
prices. Production and exports are expected to increase in the future if the attempts of the Brazilian
government to reduce the country's ethanol dependency as a fuel source are successful.
For Brazil, the computed AMS is $857 million,
and a reduction of 13.3% results in an AMS of $743
million. The sugar tariff equivalent is reduced from
46 to 35%. The computed volume of subsidized
exports is 791300 t, which is reduced to 601 400 t. A
24% reduction in the value of subsidized exports is
applied which causes Brazil's export subsidies to
decline from $56 000 to $43 000.
2.5. Japan
Japan is the world's third largest sugar importer,
importing approximately twice the amount of sugar
it produces domestically. Since Japan is a high-cost
sugar producer, it controls the sugar market in order
to secure a minimum level of domestic production.
These controls include producer subsidies and import
policies. Japan's producers receive a government
guaranteed price that is considerably higher than the
world price. For example, in 1987 the Japanese farm
price was set at about 65 c per lb of raw sugar.
Farmers receive the guaranteed price from proces-

S. Devadoss, J. Kropf/ Agricultural Economics 15 ( 1996) 83-96

sors who, in tum, sell the raw sugar to a government-established corporation for a higher price and
buy the commodity back from this corporation for a
lower price. Thus, the government provides subsidy
to processors and producers. To support these subsidies and maintain a stable market price, Japan establishes high fixed and variable levies on sugar imports. In 1987, duties, excise taxes, and variable
levies amounted to 31 c per lb of imported sugar,
which raised the final price for the imports to 41 c
per lb. Japanese consumers also contribute to the
revenue by paying higher domestic sugar prices,
which results in a relatively low per capita consumption. Japan's policies also encourage HFCS consumption.
For Japan, the computed value of the AMS for
sugarcane production is 88 billion yen, and a reduction of 20% calls for an AMS of 71 billion yen. The
computed sugar tariff equivalent is 41.5 yen per kg
and a reduction of 15% brings the tariff equivalent to
35.3 yen per kg. Japan does not face the import
access requirement because of its large volume of
sugar imports. Similarly, the export competition provisions do not apply to Japan because it does not
export sugar.
Though the other countries and regions included
in the model pursue intervention policies, these policies and the corresponding UR provisions are not
discussed here owing to space limitations. However,
these policies are incorporated in the analysis.

3. Empirical model

A non-spatial equilibrium world sugar model consisting of 21 countries/regions is used for the analysis. The exporting countries/regions included in the
model are Australia, Brazil, Cuba, the European
Union, India, South Africa, Thailand, other Central
America, and other South America. The importing
countries/regions are the United States, Canada,
Japan, Mexico, Indonesia, China, the Former Soviet
Union, Eastern Europe, other Western Europe, other
Asia, other Africa, and the rest of the world (ROW).
This large-scale model allows us to incorporate
the influence of domestic and trade policies on production, consumption, stocks, and trade. Furthermore, the incorporation of government intervention

87

policies enables us to accurately capture the effects
of trade liberalization. The model includes the dynamic behavior of the sugar market, which captures
the adjustments in the endogenous variables over
time in response to policy changes. The influence of
macroeconomic variables (exchange rates, interest
rates, inflation rates, and GNP) and time lags in
production are also explicitly modelled.
Data for production, consumption, exports, imports, and ending stocks are obtained from the Economic Research Service and from the Foreign Agricultural Service of the US Department of Agriculture. Data for area harvested, yield, and extraction
rates are obtained from the Food and Agricultural
Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. Macroeconomic data such as income, population, exchange
and inflation rates are obtained from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The estimation period
includes the years 1970 to 1992.
For each country, functional relationships for supply and demand components and price linkage equations are estimated. The estimation of the supply side
consists of sugarcane or sugarbeet area planted and a
total sugar production equation that is the product of
the area planted, the extraction rate, and the yield.
The supply functions incorporate the domestic policies pursued by various countries. The estimation of
the demand components consists of sugar consumption and ending stocks. If countries pursue domestic
policies that tax the consumers by making them pay
a higher domestic price than the world price, then the
domestic price is used to estimate the consumption
functions. The price linkage equation links the domestic price to the world price. The wedge between
the domestic price and the world price reflects the
effects of trade policies conducted by a country. For
each country, the net excess demand or excess supply is derived and the world market clearing is
established by equating the net import demand of all
importers and the net export supply of all exporters.
The model incorporates a great many details such
as inclusion of a large number of country-level disaggregations and the modeling of HFCS, incorporation of domestic and trade policies, inclusion of
macroeconomic factors, and accounting for unique
production characteristics. A rigorous analysis can be
conducted, therefore, to accurately estimate the effects of trade libera,lizations.

The cross prices include wheat for US beet, cotton for US cane, wheat for Australia and Canada, and ethanol for Brazil.

The model includes a total of 82 endogenous
equations and 21 market-clearing equations, which
determine 103 endogenous variables and use 205
exogenous variables. Both linear and non-linear techniques are used in estimating the endogenous equations. The estimation procedure used is ordinary least
squares (OLS). The OLS estimation technique is
preferred over simultaneous estimation techniques
because, with a large number of exogenous variables
and a limited number of observations, simultaneous
estimation techniques pose a degrees of freedom
problem. The principal component technique is frequently used to circumvent the degrees of freedom
problem. Since the number of exogenous variables is
too large in the model, the principal component
technique was not used to estimate the model.
In the interest of brevity, the complete empirical
model could not be included in the text. In Table 1
we report the estimated supply and demand elasticities for various countries. In Table 2 we report price
transmission elasticities. These elasticity estimates

represent behavioral relationships in the model, which
are compared with those found in the literature. The
estimated own-price supply elasticity for beet in the
United states is 0.215 and cross-price (wheat price)
elasticity is - 0.077. The own-price beet supply
elasticity is comparable to the estimates of Lopez
(1989) at 0.246 and Vroomen (1984) at 0.280.
Sudaryanto's estimate (Sudaryanto, 1987) for an earlier period is 0.70. The estimated own-price elasticity

for cane in the United States is 0.054; cross-price
(cotton price) elasticity is - 0.05; and input price
elasticity is -0.046. The own-price cane elasticity is
very inelastic because of the ratooning practices for
sugarcane, which limit the acreage adjustment to
price changes. This inelastic estimate is comparable
to the elasticity reported by Lopez at 0.1 03, Vroomen
at 0.135, Leong ( 1985) at 0.16, and Sudaryanto at
0.17. Wong et al. (1989) (WSB) estimated an aggregate US sugar supply elasticity of 0.221. The estimated own-price consumption elasticity is -0.042
and income elasticity is 0.254. The own-price elasticity estimate is very similar to the ones reported by
WSB at -0.048, Vroomen at -0.114, and Lopez at
- 0.141. The income elasticity estimate is comparable to that of WSB at 0.287.
Table 2 reports price transmission elasticities for
selected countries. The restrictive trade policies pursued by these countries insulate their domestic prices
from world price movements, thereby reducing price
transmission elasticities to less than one. For example, the US domestic price support scheme and the
import quota system result in a price transmission
elasticity of 0.46 only. Similarly, the EU price intervention scheme and the variable import levy policies
generate a price transmission elasticity of 0.48 only.

4. Impacts of the Uruguay Round on the world
sugar market

To examine the effects of the UR, a baseline
scenario is run to project the endogenous variables
over the period 1993 to 2001 by using the forecast
values of the exogenous variables. The forecast values of the exogenous variables are derived from
various sources: GDP, GDP deflator, exchange rates,
commodity production, and prices are obtained from
the Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute
(F APRI, 1994b). Population forecasts are obtained
from the USDA ( 1993 ). Crude oil prices and coffee
prices come from a World Bank (1992) report. The
baseline values of the endogenous variables serve as
a benchmark to measure the effects of trade liberalization.
The GATT member countries will implement the
policy provision schedule by reducing the aggregate
measurement of support, tariff equivalents, and ex-

89

port subsidies and by increasing import access. The
UR policy parameters along with the new income
growths under the UR (obtained from the USDA) are
incorporated in the world sugar trade model and the
UR scenario is run for the period 1995 to 2001. The
UR provisions will liberalize the world sugar market
as sugar producing countries reduce their domestic
producer support, sugar importing countries increase
their market access, and sugar exporting countries
reduce their export subsidies.
Table 3 presents the baseline projections and the
impacts of the UR on the net trade of major sugar
exporters and importers and on the world sugar
price. Most major sugar exporting countries increase
their net exports because of higher world sugar
prices resulting from the UR. However, the EU's net
sugar exports decline by an average of about 6%
(Fig. I) as a result of lower export subsidies required
by the export competition provision of the UR.
Thailand's net exports decrease by a very small
amount (an average of 0.7%) because the strong
consumption increases, resulting from the higher income growth under the UR, outpace the production
increases. India gains significantly from the UR because of its developing country status, availability of
more inputs, and improved technology, which result
in net exports about 9.5% higher than the baseline
(Fig. 2). Australia and Brazil also post modest increases in net exports.
The impacts of the UR on major importing countries vary. Net imports by some countries decline
slightly because of higher world prices (Canada),
increased substitution from HFCS (Japan), and production increases (Soviet Union). Higher income
growth, population growth, and reduction in tariff
equivalents increase US net sugar imports by an
average of 16.03%. It should be noted that although
this percentage increase seems large, the volume of
the net import increase is very small compared with
the level of consumption in the United States. In
Indonesia, China, and Mexico, strong consumption
increases outpace production increases causing the
net imports in these countries to rise.
The world income growth caused by the UR
increases global sugar consumption, surpassing production increases, which causes world sugar prices to
increase. The average increase in the world price is
about 8.83%, which translates into an increase of

impacts of the UR on sugar production, consumption, and exports or imports for selected countries
only. Readers interested in the results for other countries refer to Devadoss and Kropf ( 1995). Here, we
provide a detailed explanation of the UR impacts on
selected countries.
4.1. The United States

The baseline projections show a small decline in
sugarcane area of about 6000 acres and a modest
decline in sugarbeet area of about 100 000 acres
from 1995 to 2001. These declines in area are in
response to US farm policies which, in recent years,
have reduced the domestic price supports. As a result
of the UR, the cane and beet areas are lower than the
baseline areas by an average of about 0.26 and
1.24%, respectively. These decreases are caused by
the continued reduction in US domestic price support
and the ensuing decline in the producer price. The
slightly larger response of sugarbeet area to sugar
price changes is because beet supply is more elastic
than sugarcane supply. The reason for this result is
that sugarbeet is a short-term crop with significant

potential for year-to-year variation in area planted,
whereas sugarcane area is a long-term crop with
3-4-year crop cycle due to ratooning practices. Consequently, cane area planted shows little year-to-year
variation in the short run. As a result of the decreases
in cane and beet area planted, the baseline predicts
total US sugar production declines from 1995 to
2001 of about 170 000 t. The UR causes an additional decrease by an average of 1.06% (Fig. 4).
The baseline projections of the US sugar consumption show a small increase of about 40 000 t
from 1995 to 2001 caused by an increase in US
population and income. The UR contributes to an
additional income increase in the United States, lowers the price for the US consumer, and increases
HFCS prices relative to sugar prices. These developments result in an average increase in US sugar
consumption of about 1.82% over the baseline consumption.
The declining production and increasing consumption trends in the baseline will cause US sugar
imports to rise by about 360 000 t from 1995 to
2001. The tariff reductions in the market-access provision of the UR and the developments in US domestic supply and demand during the implementation

4.2. European Union

The Common Agricultural Policy's 1992 reforms
reduce domestic support for sugar producers. This
reduction will result in a decrease in total EU sugar
production of about 800 000 t in the baseline projections from 1995 to 2001. Declines in domestic supports, tariffs, and export subsidies as required by the
UR will lead to an additional decrease in total EU
sugar production by an average of about 0.53%. The
production Quotas A and B, which receive the domestic price supports, will decline by an average of
about 1% as a result of the UR. Larger declines will
occur in the later years than in the earlier years as
market signals arising from the UR tend to be
stronger toward the end of the implementation period. The EU production of C sugar, which receives
the rising world price, will grow by an average of
2.21% during the implementation period. Some of
the area allocated for Quotas A and B are used for C
sugar production because sugarbeet production in the
EU, even under C sugar, is still more profitable than
the production of alternative crops. Consequently,
the impact of the UR on EU sugar production is not
expected to be as pronounced as the impacts on other
crops.

The EU sugar consumption will increase slightly
by an average of 0.55% as a result of lower prices
and higher income growth from the UR. A projected
stagnation in EU population growth, however, will
limit the increase in sugar consumption. The decrease in total EU sugar production, the small increase in sugar consumption, and the reduction in
export subsidies as required by the UR will cause a
decrease in EU sugar exports by an average of
1.23%. This reduction in sugar exports will be less
than the EU's commitment of reducing subsidized
exports by 340 000 t because the increase in unsubsidized exports from C production is expected to
compensate for the decline in subsidized exports.
These results also corroborate the findings of FAPRI
(1994a) and USDA (1994). Thus, this decline would
have been larger if it were not for the increase in the
unsubsidized exports resulting from higher production of C sugar.
4.3. Australia

Australia's sugar production is strongly affected
by developments in the world sugar market and the
world sugar price because the country is a sugar
exporter and sells its exports at the world price.

S. Devadoss, J. Kropf/ Agricultural Economics 15 ( 1996) 83-96

Australian sugar producers are responding to the
higher world price from the UR by increasing their
production by an average of about 2.1% over baseline production. This increase in production is accomplished by relaxing rigid government regulations
on cane area and by transferring land from other
crop production to sugarcane production. Australia's
sugar consumption will increase only slightly (by
0.4%) as a result of higher income growth from the
UR and population growth. Larger production increases relative to consumption increases will lead to
higher sugar exports by an average of about 2.89%
over the baseline levels.
4.4. Brazil

The UR provisions entail that the developments in
the world sugar market and the world sugar price
will influence the Brazilian sugar market by relaxing
the production controls and export limits. Allowing
the sugar industry to export at world prices will let
the efficient producers adjust their production. Consequently, the increase in the world price under the
UR will cause Brazilian sugar producers to increase
their sugarcane area, which will result in production
increases of an average of about 1.5% over baseline
production. Brazil's sugar consumption will increase
by an average of 1.49% as a result of the higher
income growth from the UR, higher population
growth, and lower domestic prices. These developments will enable Brazil to increase its sugar exports
by an average of 2.3% over baseline exports.
4.5. India

Sugar production in India will increase by an
average of about 1.37% over baseline production.
!his increase is due to the increased availability of
Improved technology and inputs for production,
higher producer income, less government control,
and a higher world sugar price resulting from the
UR. Population and income increases will cause
sugar consumption to rise by an average of about
0.81% over the baseline projections. These developments will enable India to increase its sugar exports
by an average of 5.34% over baseline exports.

5. Conclusion

The liberalization of domestic and trade sugar
policies as required by the UR will have an impact
on sugar supply and demand in various countries.
The demand side will be affected by global income
growth, causing an increase in sugar consumption
that is more significant in developing countries than
in developed countries. Consumers in countries with
strong domestic and trade policy interventions will
also enjoy lower domestic consumer prices, which
will increase the competitiveness of sugar with
HFCS.
The impact of the UR on the supply side will be
less pronounced. Low-cost sugar producing countries
will benefit from the slightly higher world price and
will increase their production and exports, as is the
case in Australia, Brazil, and India. High-cost sugar
producing countries will reduce their production
slightly because of lower producer supports and domestic prices. However, the policy reforms required
by the UR have been accommodated by most countries through policy changes, which have been already implemented during the past 10 years or so.
Fo~ ~ese co~~tries, the UR largely serves to codify
extstmg poltctes. Therefore, the impact on sugar
production in these countries is rather small. This
case exists in the United States, where sugar production will decrease by only an average of 1%. In the
EU, subsidized sugar production will decrease while
unsubsidized production will increase, resulting in a
small decline of sugar exports.
As a result of the UR, the consumption increases
will exceed the production increases, causing the
world price to rise only slightly. In general, the
liberalization of the sugar market caused by the UR
will contribute to a more stable world sugar price
and a more efficient allocation of economic resources in sugar production in various countries.
