Abstract
This paper describes an econometric assessment of wine market prices for 21 of the Crus Classes chateaux in the Bordeaux
region of France. The model developed in the analysis attempts to define the relationship between factors that influence wine
quality and those that influence wine prices. Characteristics of the models are: (1) climate influences on grape composition
(acid and sugar levels), (2) grape composition influences on market prices, (3) subjective quality evaluations (Parker-points)
on market prices, and (4) the effects of age of the wine on market prices.
The results indicate that composition levels ofMerlot-dominated wines are more climate sensitive than those from Cabernet
Sauvignon-dominated wines. Overall, warm, dry summers result in high sugar and low acid levels at harvest which in turn
lead to higher quality wines.
Wine market price sensitivity to Parker-point ratings indicates that properties with high Cabernet Sauvignon-dominated
wines are highly dependent on the external ratings while Merlot-dominated wines have a decreased rating sensitivity. Smaller
properties tend to gain over proportionally from high ratings indicating great jumps in price from year to year. Additionally,
chateaux that have experienced high ratings for past vintages exhibit great sensitivity to point steps in ratings for current
vintages.
Aging has a positive effect on Bordeaux wine pricing. This is due to the increasing maturity as well as the increasing
absolute scarcity. Absolute scarcity of product is expressed by the size of the property, with small properties producing less
per vintage and therefore having less in the market. Additionally, Merlot-dorninated wines exhibit more maturing potential
and profit more from aging than Cabernet Sauvignon-dominated wines.
Average per chateau real annual profit ranges from 1 to 10%. High levels of grape ripeness, absolute scarcity, and smaller
properties that are dominated by Merlot in their blend lead to the highest profits. Forecasts for a vintage not yet on the market
indicates that 1995 is better than 1994 for both Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot-dominated wines, but that 1996 and 1997 are
not as good as 1995, especially for Merlot-dominated wines.© 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

wines sometimes achieve in auctions. Since many
of the famous red wines like Chateaux Margaux,
Mouton-Rothschild, Lafite-Rothschild or Petrus,
which the average wine consumer has probably not
experienced, but certainly heard of - this occurs
especially to Bordeaux wines. The interest of professional investors in Bordeaux wines has increased
dramatically in the last few decades because the profit
yielded per year can be tremendous. According to a
ranking of the best investment-wines of 1996, yields
of 500% and more are routinely achieved (Bllittel
and Stainless, 1997). Therefore, the economic literature has begun to examine this theme with the goal
to recommend appropriate investment strategies and
portfolios (i.e., Schubert, 1996). In general, these
recommendations are based on experiences of the
potential for the development of certain wines and on
intuitive knowledge of the product. Even with this increasing interest in wine investment, empirical studies
on wine pricing are still rare. This lack of economic
assessment is in fact amazing, first, because of the
wide spread variance of the prices of single chateaux,
and secondly, in respect to the variance within single
vintages. For example a bottle of Chateau Cheval
Blanc from the 1972 vintage is available for less
than 20US-$, while the 1982 vintage from the same
chateau costs about 500US-$.
Two of the rare empirical investigations on this topic
are those of Combris et al. (1997) and Ashenfelter
et al. (1995). After estimating a hedonic price function
for many Bordeaux wines, Combris et al. (1997) come
to the conclusion that wine prices are rarely caused
by organoleptic (sensory) characteristics. Although it
is true that experts, through many tastings, can build
a complex quality profile for individual chateaux or
vintages, the information is not overly useful for the
average consumer since they would not want to repeat
this procedure. Given that the average consumer only
has general and sometimes imperfect information on
quality, label notoriety seems to be much more important. Since Combris et al. (1997) investigated only
young wines of all quality levels it is difficult to apply
these results to top Bordeaux wines due to the enormous price variances of different vintages.
This empirical shortage is remedied by the econometric approach of Ashenfelter et al. (1995). The
authors developed a panel equation, termed the
"Bordeaux-equation", which defines the influence of

aging and different weather characteristics on a generalized Bordeaux index. Beside the evaluation of
particular determinants, this approach also provides a
relative prediction of prices for wines which are not
yet on the market but have been sold as futures. It is
obvious that the generalized Bordeaux-equation, as
an average index, cannot explain the price of a single
chateaux' wines with the necessary exactness needed
in an investment. This problem could be solved in
general by estimating not a region-wide average index
but single equations for each chateau. On one hand
this approach could easily be adopted to help explain
and forecast prices of single chateau wines. On the
other hand, the blend of each chateau cannot be neglected since the top wines of Bordeaux are cuvees
made from different varieties that are expected to
react in a different way to climatic factors. Therefore,
it is probable that the quality and prices could also
be different according to the particular blend. This
should be taken into account allowing the "objective
quality" of the single varieties to be estimated separately. However, according to Combris et al. (1997),
the impact of the wine quality on the price is not compelling since the quality information is not available
or obvious to the average consumer. This information
shortage has been remedied by the development of numerous subjective quality point systems and rankings
in the specialized literature (e.g., Broadbent, 1981;
Penning-Roswell, 1989; Parker, 1985). Since the hedonic approach assumes that most wine consumers
consider these rankings in their buying decisions,
their inclusion in an economic model is warranted.
Accordingly, the following paper introduces a recursive econometric multi-equation model on Bordeaux
wine pricing. First, the model quantifies the dependence of Crus Classes prices on climatic influences,
grape composition, Parker-points, and aging. Second,
the model allows one to forecast wine prices in order
to compare achievable market prices and actual future prices. In the first section the general structure of
the model and the database used to construct it is explained. Next, the climatic influences on wine composition are described for the Bordeaux region. Then the
recursive model blocks "composition" and "price" and
the corresponding equation specifications from which
the adaptability of a simultaneous solution is shown.
The final section presents model simulations and sensitivity results.

2. Data and methods
One of the more typical features of great Bordeaux
wines is their extraordinary longevity. It is through
maturity, achieved during long storage, that most
Bordeaux wines develop their typical character. Many
vintages have life expectancies of several decades and
have been known to remain viable for over a century. Together, the longevity and the high profit yield
expectancy, make Bordeaux wines not only a consumption good in great demand but also a desirable
international speculative good. Hence, the wines of
many of the chateaux from Bordeaux (many other top
wines from other regions are represented as well) are
traded all over the world in established wine auctions.
This system guarantees, similar to a stock market,
a comparatively high price transparency. Therefore,
it can be assumed that auction prices indicate the
relative (economic) scarcity and therefore the international esteem for those wines. For this analysis,
the price database refers to all relevant wine auctions
held worldwide within 1996/1997 and is calculated as

the weighted arithmetic average of all auction prices
of one wine. 1 To obtain a complete set of data,
only frequently traded wines are considered in this
analysis. Therefore, the current investigation is restricted to the vintages 1980-1994 and to 21 chateaux
(Table 1 gives the price data set used in the analysis). The model is conceived as a pure panel model
(cross-sectional model) which attempts to explain
the wine prices of different chateaux and vintages.
All equations are specified linearly, logarithmically
or semi-logarithmically, and are estimated with the
ordinary least square (OLS) technique. The model is
recursive and consists of two sections: a composition
and climate section and a price section.
First it is assumed that climatic variables such as
precipitation, insolation or temperature determine particular quality features of the grapes- the composition of the raw material. Here, the model distinguishes
between the two main varieties grown in Bordeaux:

Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot (which account for
over 80% of grapes grown in the region) and explains
their specific sugar and acid content at harvest (four
separate equations). These endogenously determined
variables are then used as explanatory variables in the
price section of the model, which ultimately consists
of21 equations, (i.e., one for every chateau in the analysis). According to the average blend of the particular chateau, the specification of the equation involves
more Cabernet Sauvignon or more Merlot compositional features. In addition to these exogenous wine
quality variables, variables for the best known international quality rankings for each chateau, the so-called
Parker-points (Parker, 1985), and the relative ages of
the particular wines are included in the equations. The
complete structure of the model is given in Fig. 1.

2.1. Climate, phenology, and composition
effects on quality
Grapevines are a geographically expressive crop,
being grown in distinct climate regimes worldwide
that provide the ideal situations to produce high quality grapes. This is nowhere more evident than in
Bordeaux, a region that is synonymous with some
of the best wines in the world. While the interactions between the local climate, soil, and site location
(termed the "terroir' by the French) play a varied

role in the growth and output of the grapevines, the
general effect of the climate is well known. Mild to
cool and wet winters followed by warm springs, then
hot summers with little precipitation produce the best
wines (see Jones (1997) for a review). Therefore,
there is an optimum climate regime that contributes
greatly to the overall quality of a given vintage.
Occurring as a direct effect of climate, the
grapevine's growth can be described by its phenological events. Phenology is the study of individual
physiological events or growth stages of plants or
animals that recur seasonally in response to climate.
Understanding the phenology of a given plant system
is important in determining the ability of a region
to produce a crop within the confines of its climatic
regime. From a husbandry viewpoint, knowledge of
a plant's growth stages is advantageous as cultural
and chemical practices can be applied at optimum
times in a plant's annual growth cycle. Additionally,
information regarding growth stages can be useful
in estimating crop yields. Vitis vinifera grapevines
("wine-bearing vines") are a phenologically distinct
crop with the most important developmental stages
being debourrement (bud break), fioraison (flowering), veraison (color change and maturation nascent),
and harvest (grape maturity). 2 The timing of these
developmental stages is also related to the ability of
the vine to yield fruit, with early and fully expressed
(unhindered by extremes of heat or cold, storms, etc.)
phenological events usually resulting in larger yields
(Jones, 1997; Mullins et al., 1992). Additionally, the
phenological timing has been related to vintage quality with early harvests generally resulting in higher
quality vintages (Ribereau-Gayon and Guimberteau,
1996).
Many studies looking at the relationship between
climate and quality have employed monthly averages
in temperature and precipitation as the independent
variables (for a good review see Gladstones, 1992).
Given that plants do not respond to a calendar division of climate data, and that phenological timing
and quality are related (Jones, 1997), each vintage
in the Bordeaux region is divided according to the
2 For the main red varieties grown in Bordeaux, bud break occurs
in late March or early April, floraison occurs in early June, veraison
occurs from mid to late August, and harvest usually commences
at the end of September or in early October (Jones, 1997).

G.V. Jones, K.-H. Storchmann/Agricultural Economics 26 (2001) 115-133

major phenological events of bud break, floraison,
veraison, and harvest, thereby creating four stages 3
based upon the grapevine's annual response to the
prevailing climate (Jones and Davis, 2000a). This
allows for a comprehensive analysis of the climatic
influences on the quality using a physiological approach. Climate variables of precipitation, estimated
potential evapotranspiration (PET), 4 and the number
of days with temperatures more than 25 and 30°C are
summed by day and phenological stage to produce up
to four independent climate variables per stage that
could ultimately play a role in quality levels.
Nearing harvest time, key vintage characteristics
are the chemical composition of the grapes. Two of
the chief determinants of crop ripeness are the relative amounts of sugar and acid found in the berries
leading up to harvest (Mullins et al., 1992). Sugar represents a measure of the potential alcohol content of
the wine and total acidity is a measure of the fixed
and volatile acids present in the berries and has a direct influence on wine color, the growth of yeast and
bacteria, and its pleasing balance with sugars on flavor qualities. During maturation, the levels of these
two measures generally proceed in opposite directions:
sugar levels increase and acid levels decline (Amerine
et al., 1980). Optimum ripeness levels of sugar and
acid vary by variety and region but should range between 165-230 g/1 of sugar and 3-9 g/1 of total acidity (Winkler et al., 1974). In general, relatively high
sugar levels produce better quality while high acid levels produce lower quality (Ribereau-Gayon and Guimberteau, 1996; Jones and Davis, 2000b). Ideally, there
exists a ratio of sugar to acid that determines proper
ripeness and quality potential.
Daily climate data of maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and precipitation for the Bordeaux station for 1949-1997 are obtained from
METEO-France (1998). The climate data are divided
3 For the remainder of this analysis, each of the four stages will
be represented by D = the dormant stage (harvest of one year
to bud break of the next), B = the bud break stage (bud break
to floraison), F = the floraison stage (flowering to veraison), and
V = the veraison stage (veraison to harvest).
4 The PET variable is equal to the sum of the average temperatures I: (Tmax - Tmin)/2 minus precipitation. It is a derived
temperature-related variable that has been used to study the elimate/viticulture relationship. It is referred to as the Ribereau-Gayon
and Peynaud Index.

by the mean phenology of the grapevines 5 from reference vineyards observed by Ribereau-Gayon and
Guimberteau (1996, pers. commun.). Composition
values (acid and sugar levels) for Cabemet Sauvignon
and Merlot grapes for 1970-1997 are also supplied by
Ribereau-Gayon and Guimberteau (1996). Acid and
sugar levels are measured at the reference vineyards
prior to harvest and are averaged to obtain a single
value for each vintage and variety. Table 2 shows
the values for the significant climate variables in the
analysis and grape composition for the years used in
the analysis.
The estimated equations for the climate effects on
Cabemet Sauvignon and Merlot grape composition are
shown in Table 3. Cabernet Sauvignon sugar levels
are influenced by precipitation throughout the growing
season. Too much early season precipitation (BPREC)
has a negative effect by delaying growth and late season precipitation (FPREC and VPREC), especially
during the ripening period, has a negative impact by
possibly diluting the berries and producing lower relative sugar levels. Also many days of warm temperatures during floraison would mean that the grapes ripen
rapidly and to a higher degree. Increased precipitation
over the growing season increases the Cabernet Sauvignon acid levels and results in unripe grapes. On the
other hand, warm and dry conditions, especially from
flowering to harvest, allow the acid levels to decline
and the grapes to become ripe. A similar set of climate influences on Merlot grape composition is seen
with warm and dry periods of growth providing higher
sugar levels while wetter periods coincide with higher
acid levels.

2.2. Wine prices
The price of a wine is determined by many different factors. One of the more important factors is
an assumption that the value of a wine is greater the
older it is. For the majority of wines this generalized
assumption is actually not correct. Only outstanding
wines, to which it can be argued that all of the wines
5 The dates of floraison, veraison, and harvest are supplied by
Ribereau-Gayon and Guimberteau (1996, pers. commun.) and the
dates of bud break are estimated from climate data with bud growth
considered to occur when the mean daily temperature is above
10°C for five consecutive days (Mullins et al., 1992; Jones, 1997).

• Model calculations: time 1980-1994, T-ratios in parentheses, and variables as described in Table 2.

investigated in this study certainly belong, are able to
profit from increased aging. The reasons for this are:
• On one hand, the aging potential is caused by the
slow development to maturity for many of the top
wines from Bordeaux. In its youth Bordeaux wines
are characterized by an extremely high content of
tannins. In this state these wines are astringent and
not yet ready for drinking. But with increasing storage, generally 10 years or more, the tannins and astringency are reduced and the wine becomes more
pleasing to the palate. This optimum drinking condition can last several decades before the quality
begins to decline.
• On the other hand, the available stock of a particular wine will decrease over time as it ages (i.e.,
the product is consumed and the absolute scarcity
increases). Therefore, in the price equations a variable T (trend) is included that could be interpreted

as a constant linear retirement function of a certain
(distinct) initial stock. It is true that data of absolute production could give useful additional information, but these data are not publicly available in
the necessary detail.
• Additionally, the aging of a wine expresses storage
costs and opportunity costs (costs of tying down
capital as well as borrowing on credit).
Given the decline in available product, a continuously linear increasing variable T (trend) is incorporated into the model. The trend variable starts with
1994 = 1 and ends with 1970 = 25, allowing for
the evaluation of the effect of aging and scarcity on
wine prices. Generally, the wine p1ice of a respective
chateau (Pi) would be expected to be correlated positively with Ti, for example:
(1)

122

G. V. Jones, K.-H. StorchmannlAgricultural Economics 26 (2001) 115-133

where Si denotes the stochastic error term. Here it is
especially emphasized that Ti is not to be interpreted
as an element of a time series model, but that it only
expresses different features of the wines (i.e., the state
of aging).
Furthermore, it is assumed that the wine price is
correlated positively with the relative composition of
the grapes. The price equation is referenced to the calculated sugar and acid equations given in the prior
section. According to the results, it can be assumed
that high sugar values have positive effects on wine
prices and that high acid values have a negative influence on the wine prices. 6 Hence the specification has
the following form:

(2)
Except some wines from the Pomerol region, Bordeaux Cru Classes 7 are blends of different varieties.
Overall, Cabemet Sauvignon and Merlot are the
main varieties grown in the region but other varieties
such as Cabemet Franc, Petit Verdot, and Malbec
are planted to varying degrees throughout the region.
Although the shares of the single varieties used in
the wines vary from vintage to vintage, the varietal
priorities of the individual chateaux can be seen in
the area devoted to growing the different varieties
(Table 4). Hence, chateaux with Cabemet Sauvignonand Merlot-dominated wines can be distinguished
from one another and are considered in the specification of the price equations.
The international wine press regularly publishes
quality ratings and continually updates them as long
as the wine remains available on the open market.
Although these ratings are influenced by personal subjective preferences (wine styles and varietal composition), and do not lay claim to measurable objectivity,
6 On the influence of taste and chemical attributes of wine and
their impact on consumption see Nerlove (1995) and Schneider
(1996).
7 For the western part of the Bordeaux area, the Medoc, a fivestage classification was introduced in 1855, which has mainly
remained the same. The list of Crus Classes includes 61 CMteaux.
The five Premier Cru Classes are CMteaux Haut Brion, LafiteRothschild, Latour, Margaux and, since 1973, Mouton-Rothschild.
In the second half of this century, classifications for the regions of
Graves and St. Emilion have been introduced. A new classification
according to the ancient method was undertaken by Ashenfelter
(1997).

they are, however, able to deliver information regarding the current state and the development potential of
single wines. Of the many wine writers, the most well
known and influential is Robert M. Parker. His ratings,
based on a 100-point system, are widely used within
the industry as a gauge of relative quality. It must
be emphasized that once a vintage is given a point
rating, it is not permanently fixed, but is regularly
checked for quality changes at new tastings and, if
necessary, corrected. 8 However, since Parker-points
are orientated at the future potential of a wine, normal
aging does not affect the rating. Hence, Parker-points
do not cover the influence of the trend variable T.
To obtain a single value for each vintage and for
each chateau, the following calculations are based on
the current Parker-point ratings from 1994/1995 as
given in Table 5. The high influence of Parker-points
on purchasing patterns and wine prices is undisputed
(e.g., see Kiihler and Kiihler, 1995; Ashenfelter and
Jones, 2000), and can be recognized by the "shooting
stars" chateaux which were "discovered" by Parker.
Therefore, the price function can be extended by a
variable called PT (Parker-points)

In the case where wines of particular vintages were
not traded (e.g., the Cheval Blanc of 1991), a dummy
variable is included in the equation. Dummy variables
can also reveal erratic items like a change of an owner
or cellarmaster, modernization of production facilities,
etc., whose influence could not be described sufficiently by the introduced variables. This occurs especially to the vintage 1982. The extreme high auction
prices cannot be explained for all chateaux sufficiently
by age, sugar and acid values, and Parker-points.
Therefore, for this year a dummy variable is introduced under the assumption that only a small
amount of product is available on the open market.
Additionally, determinants which are time-invariant,
such as slope, aspect, soil (i.e., Pomerol, 1989) or
Cru-classification, etc. generally do not cause annual
quality variations, but mainly determine the price
level and are included in the equation by a constant.
8 Spectacular devaluations occur often in the re-evaluation of the
vintages. For instance the CMteau Mouton-Rothschild and Chateau
Latour from 1979 suffered a downgrading from 85 to 72 and from
90 to 85 points, respectively. See Kiihler and Kiihler (1995).

All estimated price equations for the 21 selected
chateaux are given in Table 6. The results reveal that
wine prices react with great sensitivity to variations
in the sugar/acid ratio as well as Parker-points. Therefore, both variables are included in a polynomial form
in the function and cause above average elasticities regarding changes of the independent variable. Hence,
the effects of an increase of Parker-points from 94 to
95 are clearly much higher than those caused by an
increase from 84 to 85. The same can be seen for
the sugar/acid ratio (which is often used to evaluate
ripeness). Additionally, wine prices tend to increase
with aging and, except for Chateau Petrus and Talbot,
the trend variable (T) was introduced in a linear form
in the equations. Finally, all equations contain one or
two dummy variables which indicate either corrections
for the previously mentioned very high 1982 prices,
missing data of single vintages, or some other change
with which data are not available.

for this study, the Cheval Blanc equation was specified
as a Merlot equation. However, for the overall results,
the MAPE-values in the range 7-26% are to be judged
against the background of the extremely high volatility of the dependent variables. Hence the percentage
deviations are naturally high when the explained variable, the wine price, fluctuates near zero, although
the adjustment of the equation is quite satisfactory. In
those cases the explanatory power of the MAE and the
RMSE is higher and, compared to the dimension of
the dependent variable, these tests are more moderate.
The MEAN ratio indicates that the variables scarcely
are under- or over-estimated. An underestimation of 5
US-$/bottle in the case of Chateau Mouton Rothschild
would appear, against the background of the dimension of its prices, to be negligible.

To evaluate the quality of an econometric model
the properties of the model and its explanatory power
should be checked by several statistical tests. Important indications can be gained from a comparison between the actual data and a simultaneous
"ex-post"-solution of the model. From the numerous test statistics available, those employed in this
research are:
• the mean error, MEAN= *L:?=r CYi - Yi),
• the mean absolute error, MAE= *L:?=l I.Yi - yi[,
• the root mean square error,
RMSE = *)L?=r (Yi• the mean absolute percentage error,
MAPE = !nL...z=i
"'! Iji;-y;
I•
y;
Yi) 2 ,

The statistics above are examined to evaluate the quality of the complete wine price model. The test results,
as assembled in Table 7, show a satisfactory improvement over the observed data, especially in respect to
the sugar and acid values, while the MAPE for the
wine prices is much higher. This is especially true for
Chateau Cheval Blanc, which has a 26% mean absolute percentage error. This large MAPE can mainly be
attributed to the high share of Cabernet Franc in its
blend. Since Cabernet Franc data were not available

of four chateaux are shown. Overall the model is able
to reflect the actual data very well. Even for problematic cases, like Chateau Cheval Blanc, the explanatory
power of the model falls within an acceptable range.

3. Sensitivity analysis
In the model introduced in this analysis, the influence of single determinants on the wine price can
be isolated and evaluated. One of the advantages of
an econometric model, in contrast to intuitive methods, is that in the scope of sensitivity analysis a variation of one of these determinants can be simulated
as well as the impacts quantified. Since the model is
cross-sectional, only the average effect of these factors
on the wines of different vintages for single chateaux
can be calculated. Therefore, with the model, it is not
possible to predict the development of prices of one
single wine, for instance the Chateau Cheval Blanc

1982. For this purpose a time series model would be
necessary, which explains the development of the price
of one single wine over a long period of time, not
only by the characteristics of the wine itself, but also
by economic benchmark data and their inter-temporal
variations. However, in the scope of the model introduced in this analysis, it is possible to quantify the
impact on average prices for all wines of a given year
(here 199611997) and for single chateaux, by the variation of one or several exogenous variables. Hence,
the influence of climatic determinants, Parker ratings,
and the impact of aging can be quantified.
3.1. Climate sensitivity
As described earlier, the main varieties of the Bordeaux wines are characterized by different climatic influences. Accordingly, one purpose of blending wines
is to balance the disadvantages resulting from weather
conditions of a particular vintage which in turn affect

In comparison, price decreases for typical Cabernet Sauvignon-dominated wines like Haut Brion
(-5.3%) or Mouton-Rothschild (-8.6%) are noticeably less. Although Merlot-dominated wines are
clearly under-represented among the investigated
wines, Fig. 3 shows that with increasing Cabernet
Sauvignon shares planted (Table 4), the compensating character of that variety becomes obvious and
therefore the price sensitivity decreases.
3.2. Parker-point sensitivity

the ripeness of the different vanetles (Kiihler and
Kiihler, 1995). Since the weather during the ripening
period plays an important role in the grape quality, a
model simulation of the influence of a cooler, wetter period from veraison to harvest on sugar, acid,
and price is evaluated. In this scenario the exogenous variables VPET (a measure of overall heat and
dryness), VTEMP25, and VTEMP30 were reduced
by 25% (which could easily occur within the normal
climate variability), while VPREC was assumed to
be 25% higher (see Table 2 for abbreviations). The
results of this simulation reveal that sugar and acid
values of Merlot are much more sensitive in respect
to variations in veraison stage climate as is Cabernet
Sauvignon (Table 8). Due to the simulated poorer
veraison stage climate conditions, the sugar values
for Cabernet Sauvignon decrease by 2.46 g/1 (1.3% ),
while those for Merlot decrease by 5.47 g/1 (2.7%). In
respect to the simulated acid values, the differences
are even more significant: the acid values for Cabernet Sauvignon increase by 5% and increase by 17%
for Merlot. From the prior climate analysis and the
simulations, it is confirmed that the Merlot variety is
much more sensitive in respect to climate influences
during the ripening period than Cabernet Sauvignon.
Overall, one can proceed on the assumption that
Merlot-dominated wines, in respect to quality as well
as price, are generally more influenced by weather
characteristics during the critical ripening stage than
Cabernet Sauvignon- dominated wines. Table 9 displays the climate impacts on the wine prices. From
the given scenario of a wetter, cooler ripening stage,
all prices decrease, but it should be noted that
this occurs to a higher degree with non-Cabernet
Sauvignon wines like Cheval Blanc (-31.3%),
Petrus (-21.1%), and Troplong Mondot (-14.1%).

The extremely high influence of quality ratings on
wine prices has often been mentioned, and sometimes
deplored, in the trade press. In the specification of
the equations, this influence is expressed by including Parker-points in a polynomial form. It is obvious
that Parker-points are oriented by "objective chemical quality measures", by which there often appears a
close correlation to the above mentioned climate determinants. However, since the test statistics are highly
significant, the problem of multicollinearity can be
neglected. 9 The wine pricing reactions caused by a
one-point increase in the Parker rating is shown in
Table 9. From the results it is clear that there are
great differences between particular chateaux in respect to Parker-point elasticities of the prices. While
the price from this simulation for Chateaux Beychevelle or Palmer has risen less than 4%, properties like
Chateaux Margaux, La Mission Haut Brion or Pichon
Comtesse de Lalande show price increases over 10%.
As shown in the following equation, these differences
are due to many of factors.

HA: area planted in hectares, PTAVG: Parker-points,
average 1980-1994.
First, it is evident that the wine's blend in respect to
the Parker-point sensitivity is very important. While
high Cabernet Sauvignon shares have the tendency
to increase the dependence on external ratings, the
rating sensitivity will be decreased by higher shares
of Merlot. Secondly, the dependence on Parker-points
is higher for smaller properties. Therefore, smaller
chateaux often gain over-proportionally from higher
ratings. Third, those chateaux which were already
rated relatively high in the past are characterized
by a higher dependence in respect to Parker-points.
Hence, as mentioned above, more attention is drawn
to a point step from 94 to 95 than one from 84 to 85.
Thus, if Parker-points are still unknown or unpublished, one would have to recommend to a risk -averse
wine investor to buy a Merlot-dominated wine from
a large property, with an average rating that has not
been over-rated in the past. Given the possibility
of an unfavorable rating later during the storage of
the wine, the probable loss is within a reasonable
limit. Otherwise a wine investor willing to take risks
should buy a Cabernet Sauvignon-dominated wine
from a small property that is given a high rating
since the chance to yield a higher profit is much
greater.

3.3. Aging sensitivity
In general the influence of aging on the Cru Classe
wines of Bordeaux is positive - the older the wine,
the more expensive the wine. But how strong is that
influence, or in economic terms what is the expected
annual return of capital? Methodologically, the influence of aging can be simulated by a variation of the
trend variable T. Increasing T by one (T + 1) the
model proceeds on the assumption that all wines are
one year older and calculates the impacts on the prices.
The amount of wine available at market is a reflection
of the calculation and refers to an average value of
one chateau - single vintages could vary from that
value. Since the model is based on the prices achieved
during 1996, the yields are calculated in real prices
(i.e., in terms of 1996 prices). Table 9 reveals that the
influence of aging differs among chateaux. Real average yields of less than 1.5% are seen for Chateaux
Lafite-Rothschild, Leoville Las Cases and Beychevelle

129

in comparison to those of 6.6 and 9.6% for
Chateaux La Mission Haut Brion and Petrus, respectively.
From an empirical point of view, the main influence on the annual increase in value seems to be
the size of the producing chateau, since the absolute
scarcity is expressed. The results indicate that, for
the smaller producing properties, there will be less
wine available in the future and in turn higher annual increases in value. Furthermore, it is shown that
Merlot-dominated wines profit more from aging than
do Cabernet-dominated wines. 10 A simple regression
over the 21 chateaux confirms this connection

where S.E.: 1.06, R2 : 0.732, T-ratios in parentheses,
with: SENSAGE: aging sensitivity (annual yield) in
% according to Table 9, MER: share of Merlot in %
area planted, HA: area planted in hectares.
From these results, the best recommendation to
wine investors who want to maximize their annual
yields is to buy mainly Merlot-dominated wines from
small properties such as Petrus. A wine investor of
this kind is comparable to a conservative shareholder
with risk aversion who aims for dividends only. If,
however, a short-term yield is desired, shareholders
as well as wine investors should turn to the new issues. In this case, these are sold as subscriptions or
futures. The wine is normally purchased one year after the harvest for a fixed price and once it is put on
the market two years later, a scarcity-oriented price
increase could appear. Thus, the "rentability" of wine
subscriptions should always be assessed against the
background of the uncertain market price in the future. Therefore, a forecast of future values for already
harvested, but not yet traded wines, could be useful to
examine whether a subscription or futures purchase
would be lucrative or not.

4. Forecast
In addition to the prediction of prices for wines
which are already introduced on the market by varying
10 However, it needs to be pointed out that there is a multicollinear
relation between both variables: smaller chiiteaux tend to concentrate on Merlot.

the aging variable T (see Section 3.3), the model is
also able to predict market prices of wines which are
still in the barrel and were tasted only by a few individuals. As input for the model, the knowledge of climate variables as well as Parker-points is sufficient to
come to a reliable estimation of wine prices- both are
available to the public before the wines enter the market. However, since the model is cross-sectional, and
not a time series model, the influence of time-variable
factors, which could have a global structural effect
on wine buying behavior, cannot be considered in the
calculations. This temporal effect could be attributed
to a worldwide economic depression as well as an
economically-caused wine boom, as has occurred during the latest stock market crisis in Asia. 11 Therefore, the model cannot answer whether the extent of
the higher prices of the latest vintages is caused by
changes in the buying behavior or by the better quality of those vintages. However, as shown in Table 10,
it is obvious that due to the exogenous climate variSome impacts of the Asia crisis on wine prices are described

ables the 1995 vintage is to be judged better than
the 1994 vintage especially in relation to those items
having an adverse (negative coefficient) effect on quality. The weather during the 1996 and 1997 vintages
was not as good, with mixed growing season conditions leading to less than ideal quality and the need
to apply selective harvesting. The chemical measures
were predicted accordingly: for 1995, the sugar content is the highest for both varieties and the acid values are the lowest; however, for the 1996 and 1997
vintages the acid levels increase while the sugar levels
drop indicating less than ideal ripeness.
In Table 11, the predicted market prices (for 1998)
of the 1995 and 1996 vintages are given. To provide a better comparison, the prices of the 1994
vintage 12 (as given in Table 1), as well as the
12 Since these are the prices of 1996 the comparison is restricted.
Due to aging, the values of these wines will likely be higher in
1998.

development of the Parker-points, are added. The
1995 vintage yields higher predicted prices than the
1994 vintage for each of the chateaux in the analysis. This is especially evident with Premier Crus
like Chateaux Latour, Lafite-Rothschild or Margaux,
whose prices are more than double those of 1994.
This is also evident whether the wines are Cabernet
Sauvignon-dominated or Merlot-dominated (e.g., the
1995 vintage of Chateau Petrus).
The predicted prices for the 1996 vintage do not
follow the increases predicted for 1995. This can be
traced back to the fact that the compositional measures
indicate that the 1996 vintage is not likely to be as good
as the 1995 vintage, especially for Merlot-dorninated
wines. This is also reflected in the nature of the
Parker-point ratings for both years: while the ratings
for the 1996 Cabernet Sauvignon-dominated wines
generally remain on par with the 1995 ratings, the
Merlot-dorninated wine ratings decrease significantly.
Therefore, the typical Merlot-dorninated wines like
Chateaux Petrus or Troplong Mondot achieve only
92 and 89 Parker-points, respectively for the 1996
vintage, compared with 96 and 92, respectively for
the 1995 vintage. The result is extended to the prices:
while most of the Cru Classes remain close to the
1995 level, 13 for Merlot-dominated wines a distinct
price drop is expected. For example, the 1996 vintage of Chateau Petrus will cost 302 US-$ per bottle,
compared to roughly 560 US-$ for the 1995 vintage.

5. Summary
Because exquisite wines are expensive and can yield
remarkable investment appreciation, many people consider wine not only a semi-luxury drink but also a profitable capital investment. Since there are numerous illustrious properties like Chateaux Mouton-Rothschild,
Latour, Petrus, and many others, this is especially evident with Bordeaux wines. Recommendations regarding the potential development or possible profit yield,
however, are usually based on the experience or intuition of a few experts, and empirical investigations
into the topic are few. This research presents an econometric model that introduces how the prices of wines,
13 Since they are one year younger than the 1995s, a lower price
is expected.

which are already harvested but not yet traded, can be
forecast and how wine price sensitivity, in respect to
different parameters, can be evaluated.
First, the model proceeds by considering that Bordeaux wines are blends from different varieties, which
reflect different climate sensitivity. The model develops the climate/grape ripeness relationship for the two
main varieties grown in Bordeaux by examining the
relative sugar and acid values of Cabernet Sauvignon
and Merlot grapes. These exogenously-determined
variables are then used as explanatory variables in the
single price equations. From the results it is shown
that Merlot-dominated wines are more climate sensitive than Cabernet Sauvignon-dominated wines. In
climatically excellent years, outstanding quality and
prices can be expected for both varieties, although
Merlot-dominated wines tend to do the best. In climatically average or marginal years, Merlot-dorninated
wines yield below average prices. From these results,
the 1996 and 1997 vintages for Merlot-dominated
wines seem to be especially problematic.
Wine prices are also shown to be largely determined
by the rating level they achieve. The model tracks
this influence by examining the effect that the ratings given each vintage by the most prominent wine
writer, Robert M. Parker, has on price fluctuations.
Overall, the relative level of Parker-points, given by
chateau and vintage, has a large price influence as seen
by the polynomial form of the equations. This effect
varies between chateaux and is mostly due to whether
the property is Cabernet Sauvignon-dominated (increased dependence on ratings) or Merlot-dominated
(decreased rating sensitivity). Additionally, the model
shows that properties that have achieved high ratings in
the past have greater sensitivity to single point jumps
in ratings in subsequent vintages. Another aspect the
model reveals is that smaller properties have a much
higher dependence on Parker-points showing larger
relative gains from higher ratings.
For most fine wines the prices they achieve are also
partially determined by the age of the particular wine,
which generally indicates its potential "drinkability".
This is very evident for Bordeaux wines, as they have
long been regarded as wines to "lay down" for many
years. The model examines this effect on the annual
return of capital by simulating an increase in a trend
variable. Since the model is cross-sectional, the calculation reflects the average return by chateau, with

132

individual vintages varying from the value. The results indicate that there is a large degree of within
chateau variability, with 1-10% returns possible. This
effect appears to be largely influenced by two factors: (1) absolute scarcity as reflected by the size of
the property, and (2) Merlot-dominated wines profit
more from aging, on the average, than do Cabemet
Sauvignon-dominated wines.
Given that the subscription (futures) market of
Bordeaux wines has grown tremendously, the model
attempts to forecast the future values for harvested but
not yet traded wines. This is done because the wine
could be purchased one year after the harvest for a
fixed price but once it is put on the market two years
later, a scarcity-oriented price will appear. Thus, a
forecast of future values would be useful to examine
whether a subscription could yield a short-term profit
or not. Using the background climate and Parker-point
data, the model reveals that the 1995 vintage is better
than the 1994, but that the 1996 and 1997 vintages
are not as good due to lower sugar levels, higher acid
levels, and the resultant change in Parker-point ratings. A prediction of prices for 1998 reveals that the
1995 vintage indeed yields higher predicted prices
than does 1994 for each of the chateaux included in
the analysis. This effect is evident for both Cabernet
Sauvignon-dominated or Merlot-dominated wines of
the 1995 vintage. For the 1996 vintage, predicted
prices do not follow those of 1995. This is especially
true for the more climate sensitive Merlot-dominated
wines, which received lower Parker-point ratings and
had a resultant price decrease.
Under the assumption that subscription prices of
Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot wines vary proportionally, the models provide these suggestions for
investors looking to buy into the Bordeaux wine market: (1) in marginal climate years purchase wines
from properties that generally have higher percentages of Cabemet Sauvignon, (2) for the short-term
investor - when Parker-points are unknown, purchase Merlot-dominated wines from large properties
to avoid risk and Cabernet Sauvignon-dominated
wines from small properties to maximize profit potential, (3) for the long-term investor - purchase
Merlot-dominated wines as they show much greater
aging potential, and (4) in terms of absolute scarcity,
one would want to purchase wines from small properties as the relative amount available to the market

diminishes rapidly. Predicted price forecasts indicate
that, of the last three vintages (1994,1995, and 1996),
the 1995 vintage is the one to invest in as long the
wine is not over-priced to begin with.
