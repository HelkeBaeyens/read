Abstract
This paper investigates fresh meat consumption in Belgium during 1995-1998 through the specification of a three-equation
almost ideal demand system (AIDS) incorporating a media index of TV coverage and advertising expenditures as explanatory
variables. Estimated parameters and elasticity coefficients are plausible and consistent with demand theory. Own-price elasticities are relatively low, indicating a low fresh meat demand sensitivity to price changes over this period which was dominated
by mass media reports about the potential health risks associated with meat consumption. The scope of the paper extends
beyond the estimation of elasticity coefficients and includes the specification of a media index and simulations that provide
insights into the impact of negative press relative to advertising efforts. Specifically, the impact of television publicity is shown
to have been particularly negative on beef/veal expenditures in favour of pork/mixture. This finding conoborates expectations
since mass media issues mainly pertained to BSE (mad cow disease) and hormone residues during the investigated period.
With relatively little effort being undertaken and with its cunent strategy, fresh meat advertising is found to have only a minor
impact compared with negative press.© 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction

During recent years, fresh meat consumption heavily declined in Belgium as it did in most European
countries. A considerable body of scientific research
has recently been presented with respect to the impact
of meat safety scares on consumers, producers, industry and government policies (McDonald and Roberts,
1998; Latouche et al., 1998; Henson and Northen,

2000; Lloyd et al., 2000; Verbeke et al., 2000). Major
meat-health issues in the EU and Belgium included
BSE, growth hormone abuse, preventive antibiotic
residues, pathogens, classical swine fever, and the
dioxin crisis in Belgium. Each of these crises generated a considerable amount of negative mass media
coverage relating fresh meat consumption to potential
human health risks.
This paper specifies an almost ideal demand system
(AIDS) for fresh meat in Belgium to focus on health
risk and media coverage impacts on consumer behaviour. Particular emphasis is directed to the impact
of communication through mass media publicity and
fresh meat advertising on consumption decisions. The

potential negative impact of media coverage of health
issues on fresh meat consumption decisions has been
addressed by Eales and Unnevehr (1988), Carson
and Hassel (1994), Rabenstein and Thurman (1996),
Kinnucan et al. (1997) and Verbeke et al. (1999).
Findings almost unanimously point towards falling
meat intake in response to negative press coverage. A
related topic with clear policy relevance involves the
potential of communication through generic or brand
advertising, specifically in this era dominated by negative publicity from mass media. Such advertising
efforts for fresh meat have been shown to be effective
under specific circumstances (Jensen and Schroeter,
1992; Forker and Ward, 1993; Ward and Lambert,
1993; Piggott et al., 1996; Ward, 1999). However, it
has also been reported that a similar quantity of unfavourable news weighs far more heavily in consumer
decision-making than favourable news (Mizerski,
1982; Smith et al., 1988; Chang and Kinnucan, 1991;
Kinnucan and Myrland, 2000).
This analysis is based on an empirical Bayesian
approach with the specification of an AIDS for fresh
meat consumption in Belgium. Since its introduction
by Deaton and Muellbauer (1980), the AIDS model
has been used in a number of empirical studies on
food consumption in general and meat consumption
in particular. In our case, monthly time series data are
used for the estimation of model parameters and fresh
meat elasticity coefficients.
The scope of this paper clearly extends beyond
presenting elasticity coefficients as is done in many
applications of the AIDS model. A first extension
includes the specification of a media index based on
TV news reports as a measure of consumer awareness
of meat-health issues. Second, the estimated parameters are used to simulate the impact of negative
press and advertising on meat demand, expenditure
shares and overall meat expenditures. Specifically,
the potential of commercial advertising to counter
negative press or publicity is explored. The following
section introduces the AIDS framework for the analysis. Next, data sources and descriptive statistics are
presented. Major attention is paid to the specification
of the negative press variable or media index. The
presentation of the empirical results and elasticity coefficients is followed by simulations and discussion.
Finally, conclusions and recommendations are set
forth.

2. The almost ideal demand system framework
The AIDS model is generated from a consumer
cost minimisation problem as expressed by a cost or
expenditure function (Deaton and Muellbauer, 1980;
Green, 1985) that defines the minimum expenditure
necessary to attain a specific utility level at a given
set of prices. By logarithmic differentiation of the
expenditure function with respect to prices, demand
functions are obtained in budget share form. The
resulting original AIDS demand functions in budget
share form are given by
m

wu = ai

+ LYiJ log PJt + f3i (log Yt

-log Pr)

(1)

}=1

The left-hand side ofEq. (1) indicates the budget share
of the ith commodity in period t, or wu = puqu/Yt
with pit as its price, qit as its quantity andy1 as total expenditure. The right-hand side of the equation includes
the parameters a, f3 andy, p Jt as the price of commodity j in period t, and the price index Pt that is defined as
m

log Pt = ao

+ Lak log Pkt

1

k=!
m m

+2 LLYkJ log Pkt log Pit

(2)

k=1}=1

Each YiJ represents the change in the ith commodity's
budget share with respect to a change in the jth price
with real expenditures held constant. The f3i coefficients represent the change in the ith commodity's
budget share with respect to a change in real expenditures with prices held constant. To be consistent with
economic demand theory, the adding up restriction,
homogeneity and symmetry properties are imposed in
Eq. (1). Then, Eq. (1) represents a system of demand
functions which add up to total expenditure (i.e. for
each observation the sum of the budget shares over
all equations always equals one). The homogeneity
of degree zero in all prices and total expenditure
implies that changing all prices and total nominal
expenditure in proportion will not affect the physical
quantities of commodities demanded or the real purchasing power of the household. Hence, in absence of
changes in relative prices or real total expenditure, the
budget shares will be constant. Both Marshallian or

W Verbeke, R. W Ward! Agricultural Economics 25 (2001) 359-374

uncompensated and Hicksian or income-compensated
measures of elasticities can be computed following
Blanciforti and Green (1983).
As indicated by Chang and Kinnucan (1991),
classical static demand theory assumes perfect information and constant tastes and preferences at the consumer level. However, consumers frequently possess
less-than-perfect information and, moreover, tastes
and preferences may change as new or better information is received. When the assumption of constant
consumer preferences is relaxed, consumer demand
models can be extended to incorporate elements of
dynamic consumer behaviour by allowing some parameters that characterise these preferences to vary
with exogenous variables (Chang and Green, 1992;
Rickertsen et al., 1995; Briz et al., 1998; Rickertsen,
1998). One way to include the effects of information
is to assume that the price coefficients of the expenditure function depend upon information frequency
levels and advertising expenditure levels. The incorporation of explanatory communication variables is
here realised through changing the original AIDS
Eq. (1) and price index (2) into

In Eq. (3), BVADV 1 and PKADV 1 denote actual TV
advertising expenditures, respectively, for beef/veal
and pork/mixture in period t. The variable NPR 1 represents the media index. This is a measure of television coverage or negative press related to fresh meat
issues. The exact specification of this media index is
presented in the next section.
In the conventional AIDS model, the intercepts
are constants, restricted to sum to one across the
equations. The conventional adding up restriction
is preserved in the extended model by imposing

(homogeneity and symmetry) are unaffected by the
modification of the intercepts.

3. Data sources, descriptives and specifications
3.1. Descriptive statistics of the raw data
Based on an in-depth survey of the econometric
measurement literature, Clarke (1976) concluded that
estimation using monthly, bimonthly or quarterly data
is most likely free of data interval bias. Econometric
literature indicates that the impact of communication
on demand is generally a matter of months rather than
of quarters or years. Therefore, monthly observations
were used with the data extending from January 1995
to December 1998, giving a total of 48 data points for
each variable. Quantity and price data originated from
the GfK consumer household panel (GfK, 1999) and
pertained to at-home consumption. The great value of
panel data as the basic mode of data collection for
the measurement of communication effects on demand
has been stressed by Simon and Arndt (1980).
Using the panel data observations a three-equation
demand system was specified and estimated with the
three product groups defined as beef and veal, pork and
meat mixtures, and poultry. The rationale for the aggregations follows from previous research on Belgian
meat consumers (Peeters et al., 1997; Verbeke, 1999;
Verbeke and Viaene, 1999). First, aggregation of beef
and veal in the context of this research is reasonable
since both beef and veal originate from the same animal species and have been facing similar controversy
and publicity with respect to potential human health
risks. Additionally, both beef and veal are priced in
the upper price range and are hence considered as
the more expensive fresh meats (Verbeke and Viaene,
1999). Second, the aggregation of pork and meat mixture is justified by the fact that about 85% of the raw
meat used in mixtures is pork. Additionally, both meat
types are positioned as the more convenient and easy
to prepare fresh meats. The resulting three-equation
demand system, including beef/veal, pork/mixture
and poultry covers 92% of fresh meat expenditures in
Belgium. For simplicity, the expressions "beef/veal"
and "pork/mixture" are used interchangeably with
"beef' and "pork", respectively, in the remainder of
this paper (e.g. in the simulation graphs).

Considerable vanatwn in the variable values is
seen across the data period (Table 1). Per capita consumption volumes range from 0.73 to 1.44kg per
month for beef/veal, from 1.49 to 2.73 kg per month
for pork/mixture and from 0.66 to 1.39 kg per month
for poultry. Prices vary from 7.95 to 9.17 €/kg for
beef/veal, from 4.68 to 6.35 €/kg for pork/mixture
and from 4.04 to 5.65 €/kg for poultry. The resulting
expenditure shares vary between 31.2 and 42.3% for
beef/veal, between 39.1 and 50.8% for pork/mixture
and between 15.5 and 24.9% for poultry.
Since the specific objective of the paper is to account for the impact of communication on meat demand, advertising and publicity variables are included
in the demand system as previously described. Advertising expenditures have most frequently been used
as a measure of advertising activities. In Belgium,
generic meat advertising efforts are typically undertaken by a promotion board and funded partly by
government (taxpayers) and partly by checkoffs from
all participants in the meat chain. Generic advertising
efforts outweigh brand advertising, which is mainly
undertaken by retailers or specific organisations with
fully integrated meat chains. Our study relies on actual TV advertising expenditures and hence assumes
every nominal amount of money spent as an identical treatment without imposing an advertising lag

3.9

structure. This is reasonable given the relative short
period underlying the analysis. Generic and brand
TV advertising expenditure for beef/veal is denoted
BVADV, while TV advertising for pork is expressed
as PKADV. During the time interval considered, no
expenditures were assigned to television advertising
for poultry or other fresh meats. Given the limited
time period covered, neither advertising expenditure
data nor meat prices are deflated. 2
2 Reviewers raised the issue of addressing the dynamics of response to advertising shocks by using a distributed lag structure,
similar as for the negative press index (see below). In the above
model the negative press index was introduced using a predetermined lag structure and there is clear empirical evidence that press
stories had a cumulative effect. In the models set forth in this paper (Eq. (3), Table 2) all advertising is included in the form of
contemporaneous promotion expenditures. The same model was
estimated with both the beef and the pork advertising following
the same weighting procedures used for the negative press stories. However, in this case, the beef or pork coefficients were not
statistically significant. The authors recognise that, with longer
datasets, a lag structure for beef and pork advertisement may exist
and merits consideration. However, with the limits of the current
data, lag structures for beef and pork advertising are not evident.
In a number of studies on US beef promotions, Ward has concluded that the carryover effects are not evident based on various
distributed lag models covering a much longer period than used in
the present analysis. The interested reader may contact the authors
for more details.

3.2. Specification of the media index
Much previous research on media impact relied on
basic input from scientific journal databases such as
MEDLINE. The underlying hypothesis is that those
scientific medical journals are read by medical personnel, consumer advocates or the popular media, who
in turn transfer the information to consumers (Rickertsen and von Cramon-Taubadel, 2000). Although
journal database indices often perform reasonably
well, the explicit assumption of full information flow
from science to consumer is recognised as the major
drawback to this approach. Therefore, the effect of
mass media publicity (non-commercial communication) about meat is included in our AIDS model as
an information index based on the number of TV
news reports of meat issues, which are clearly closer
to consumer knowledge. Over the time period under
consideration, the vast majority of these news reports
dealt with potential negative effects of meat consumption on human health. Contrary to the situation in e.g.
the UK, multiple and less sharp peaks in TV coverage
of meat-health issues are observed in Belgium. Over
the period of 1995-1998,77% of all TV coverage was
related to beef, with the lead clearly being taken by
messages related to beef hormone abuse in 1995 and
BSE (mad cow disease) from May 1996. Other issues
dealt with the occurrence of residues or pathogens.
Several types of indices have previously been introduced for use in econometric demand analysis,
ranging from dummy vmiables (Tansel, 1993), actual
message numbers (Smith et al., 1988) or cumulative
message numbers (Brown and Schrader, 1990; Chang
and Kinnucan, 1991; Van Ravenswaay and Hoehn,
1991), sometimes with discrimination between negative and positive messages and/or including some
message or time weighting factor.
In our study, an index based on the number of
'negative' minus 'positive' TV reports is proposed as
a proxy for consumer awareness of meat issues. This
approach is fairly similar to the one used by Burton and Young (1996) which, however, was based on
newspaper articles and did not discriminate between
negative and positive reports. The rationale for subtracting positive from negative reports, leading to a
number of reports N 1 in month t, is that both message types are assumed to have an opposite impact on
consumer decision-making. While this approach was

363

based on theoretical arguments, practically it is very
similar to just using the negative press stories as the
correlation between negative stories only and the difference (as used here) is 0.98. There were 190 reports
on beef and only 12% were positive. Positive reports
were around 6% of the total reports on pork. No TV
coverage of poultry issues occurred during the data interval. Hence, in either case it was impractical to try
to disaggregate or weight and separate out the positive
from negative effects thus leading to the rationale for
using the difference between the number of negative
and positive stories. 3
The effect of mass media coverage is expected to
be cumulative extending back several months. In order to capture this, a five-period distributed lag in TV
coverage is specified, thus extending the total response
interval to a period of 6 months for negative press.
This lag is consistent with recommendations by Clarke
(1976) and with the approaches followed by Brown
and Schrader (1990), Ward and Lambert (1993) and
Kinnucan et al. (1997), as well with widely recognised findings from social psychology and consumer
behaviour research. Thus, the lagged index reflects
the presumed delayed impact of messages as information is added to the stock of knowledge or beliefs in
consumers' minds.
Given the limited number of observations, and
knowing that each lag reduces the degrees of freedom, an alternative approach was devised for creating
the cumulative press variable NPR1 • In the extreme,
the cumulative effect could be
NPRt = Nt

+ Nr-1 + Nr-2 + Nt-3 + Nt-4 + Nt-5

where each period is given the same weight. Alternatively, the cumulative effects could be weighted as

+ m2N1-2
+m3Nr-3 + m4Nr-4 + m5Nt-5

NPRr =moNt+ m1Nr-1

where the lagged mass media coverage values are
weighted by coefficients mi. A useful definition of the
3 Furthermore, it is generally easier to classify negative stories
than positive ones. Also, most of the positive messages were
broadcast accompanied by pictures, for example, of a 'mad' cow,
a slaughterhouse or a hypodermic syringe (beef hormone), thus
visually drawing the consumer's attention back to the initial problems.

weights is

where j denotes the lag, and r is determined when
estimating the AIDS model using a maximum likelihood search over T values. If r = 0 the decay is linear
and, for example, if r = 2 some lagged effects exceed the current media coverage effect. Also, define
Mm as the maximum weight among the m 1. With this
specification, the negative press variable finally enters
the model using NPRt = .L N(t-j) (m i j Mm), with
T > 0.5. Here, T = 2 is chosen but the results were
not very sensitive to the value of r beyond 0.5, where
N(t-2) and N(t-3) receive most weight.

4. Empirical results
The AIDS equations were used to estimate the parameters of the demand system for a group of three
fresh meat types in Belgium, thus assuming weak separability from other food and non-food commodities.
Hence, choices and preferences within the meat basket are assumed to be independent of price changes
for other goods. Homogeneity and symmetry restrictions were imposed in accordance with the theoretical
properties of demand systems. Since the adding up
condition holds by restrictions, one equation was
dropped from the model in order to avoid singularity.
The system is invariant to which equation is deleted
and the parameters of the dropped equation (poultry)
are derived from the adding up conditions.
The demand model is tested for negativity, which
implies that the matrix of Hessian price effects must
be negative semidefinite (Molina, 1994). A Lagrange
Multiplier test is applied to detect heteroscedasticity of
the disturbance term (Breusch and Pagan, 1979). The
LM heteroscedasticity statistic is 0.02 for the beef/veal
equation and 1.03 for the pork/mixture equation. Both
are insignificant, which means that there is no ground
for rejecting the null hypothesis of homoscedasticity.
R 2 equals 0.42 for the beef/veal equation and 0.30 for
the pork/mixture equation. The econometric parameter
estimates, associated standard errors and t-values are
presented in Table 2.
Parameters relating to beef/veal and poultry price
effects are statistically significant at the 5% level

or better. 4 None of the price effects relating to
pork/mixture are statistically significant. With respect
to expenditure effects, the beef/veal and pork/mixture
parameters are highly significant. Expenditure, Marshallian and Hicksian elasticities computed at the
means from the coefficient estimates are presented in
Table 3. Expenditure elasticity coefficients are positive as expected for normal goods and equal 1.13 for
beef/veal, 0.88 for pork/mixture and 1.05 for poultry.
These magnitudes indicate that fresh meat is still quite
sensitive to expenditure with beef/veal and poultry
being a little more sensitive than fresh pork/mixture.
The finding that the beef/veal expenditure elasticity
clearly exceeds one corroborates expectations in that
beef/veal is perceived as more expensive meat and
the typical meat for festive and special occasions in
Belgium (Verbeke and Viaene, 1999).
Price elasticity estimates are conditional on nominal expenditure on meat being constant. Own-price
elasticity coefficients are all negative, indicating the
expected inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded. As expected for normal goods, the
Hicksian own-price elasticities are smaller in absolute
terms than Marshallian elasticities. The differences
between uncompensated and compensated price elasticities result from relatively high meat expenditure
elasticities. In terms of magnitudes, all own-price
elasticities are less than or equal to one in absolute value, indicating inelastic demand relationships.
The own-price compensated elasticities for beef/veal,
pork/mixture and poultry equal -0.09, -0.61 and
-0.15, respectively. Hence, beef/veal is the least price
sensitive fresh meat while pork/mixture is the most
price sensitive, which is assumed to result from the
fact that this meat type is constantly affected by retail
price promotions.
The Hicksian values provide the most accurate picture of cross-price substitution since they provide a
measure of substitution effects net of income effects.
Most Hicksian cross-price elasticity coefficients are
positive, implying that net substitutability among fresh
meats prevails when the income effect is removed.
The negative cross-price elasticities for beef/veal and
4 Elasticity coefficients are derived following Blanciforti and
Green (1983) and Green (1985). The price slope coefficients can
either be positive (as in the current analysis), or negative, and still
provide elasticity coefficients in line with classical demand theory.

poultry are a notable exception. This finding points
towards complementarity and can be explained by the
fact that both meat types are perceived as the leaner
alternative to pork/mixture and are frequently bought
jointly for barbecuing.
Most parameters relating to advertising expenditures and negative press coverage are found to be
significant. A notable exception is A11 denoting a
marginally insignificant own advertising effect for
beef/veal using a one-tail test. Nevertheless, the
coefficient is positive as could be expected. Also,
beef/veal advertising has a significant negative effect
on pork/mixture consumption and a marginally significant but positive effect on poultry consumption.
Pork advertising has a significant positive effect on
pork/mixture consumption, mainly at the expense of
beef/veal consumption. The TV coverage effect is
significantly negative for beef/veal and positive for
pork/mixture consumption. This largely corroborates
expectations given the nature of the TV coverage,
with mainly negative associations pertaining to hormones and BSE as beef issues. The impact of the
advertising and TV coverage will be further explored
and discussed in the simulations' sections below.

5. Simulating the media impact: negative press
versus advertising
As indicated earlier, TV advertising or promotion
has the expected positive effects on beef or pork demand, while the negative press index has opposite impacts on the demand for beef (negative) and pork (positive). While a number of policy issues can be addressed
using simulation techniques, we will focus on two of
the more important questions: how much change in
fresh meat demand can be expected from TV promotion, and what are the relative impacts of the negative
press compared with the TV promotions? In each of
the following simulations, the impacts are measured
by adjusting one or more variables relative to the mean
values of all other variables in the models. The adjustments of the investigated variables range from 50 to
150% of their mean level using increments of 10%.
In Fig. 1, beef/veal prices on the bottom left axis
range from 50 to 150% of the mean price. Demand
declines from 1.4 to near 0.8 kg per capita per month,
thus clearly illustrating the important role of pricing

in the demand for beef/veal. Responses were also simulated for pork/mixture and poultry but are not presented here. For comparison, beef/veal advertising also
ranges from 50 to 150% of its mean level on the bottom right axis. While the advertising has the expected
positive effect, its impact on beef/veal demand is extremely small compared with price effects.
Given a beef price fixed at the mean level in Fig. 1,
what are the relative impacts of beef and pork promotions? In Fig. 2a and b, changes in both beef and pork
promotions are simulated while holding prices and all
other factors constant at their mean values. In contrast
to Fig. 1, the simulated effects are now shown in terms
of market shares so that the different simulations can
be easily compared. Beef advertising has the expected
positive impact on beef/veal shares while pork advertising reduces beef/veal's share of the market as seen
in Fig. 2a. Yet what is more important is the relatively
small change in the beef/veal share over the simulated
values, from about 0.357 to 0.365 or slightly under
1%. Pork/mixture's share of the market is simulated
in Fig. 2b and the conclusions are quite similar with
pork advertising positively and beef/veal advertising
negatively impacting the pork/mixture market share.
Combined, Fig. 2a and b show that beef and pork promotions have relatively small impacts on the demand
for both meats based on the estimates for the data period of the analysis.
From the previous simulations, the promotion elasticity can be calculated. Using Fig. 1, an estimated
advertising elasticity shows that for every 10% increase in advertising, the quantity demanded increases
by 0.05-0.13%, depending on the promotion level and
at the mean negative press index level. This elasticity is what would be expected; most generic promotion elasticities are quite small and these results are
generally consistent with other studies. It is equally
important to note that advertising elasticity says nothing about the rate-of-return. Small share changes can
translate in large relative gains when calculating the
rates-of-return to a particular promotion effort (see
Ward (1998) for an example of the rate-of-return in the
US beef case). Hence, while the elasticity is of interest, it generally has less meaning to decision-makers
responsible for generic promotion programs.
The AIDS estimates in Table 2 show the significant
impact of TV press reports and the particularly negative impact on beef/veal demand. Given the estimated

responses, is it reasonable to expect that beef/veal advertising could offset the negative impact of TV stories? This issue is investigated in two phases.
First, Fig. 3 depicts the estimated impact of advertising and negative press on beef market shares. In this
particular example, prices, incomes and other demand
drivers are held fixed at their mean values. TV coverage of meat-health issues has an impact on beef/veal's
market share as simulated on the bottom right axis in
Fig. 3. Beef/veal shares decline from 0.37 to near 0.35
as the number of negative stories increases. While the
positive impact of beef/veal advertising could counter
some of the negative press, it is clear from the differing
slopes of the border lines in the graph that beef/veal
promotions can hardly be expected to fully offset the
effect of negative press. It is not relevant to show the
same graph for pork/mixture since the pork industry
is the beneficiary of the negative press stories.
Second, simulations have been performed to assess the amount of beef TV advertising expenditures
needed to offset negative press, i.e. to maintain the

initial beef/veal market share. The results are displayed in Fig. 4, with the horizontal axis indicating
the media index. TV advertising expenditures are assumed to begin either from zero or from their mean
level of 1650 € per month. Generally, for each unit
increase of the media index, beef TV advertising expenditures must go up by about 500 € per month to
maintain the beef share at its original level. At the
mean media index level of 15.1, beef TV advertising
expenditure would need to be increased to about 8000
€ per month or about five times its mean value over
the data period. Finally, if negative TV stories continue to be broadcast and the media index increases to
its simulated maximum of 28.7, a 10-fold increase in
the beef TV advertising expenditures will be needed
to offset the negative press effect.
Given the promotion efforts and the resulting demand responses observed in recent history, the promotion gains are small relative to the impact of negative
press. If the effectiveness of TV promotions could be
improved, the expenditure levels needed to offset the

negative press would be somewhat less. Nevertheless,
it is apparent for the beef/veal industry that the conditions leading to the negative press must be changed
and that the content and mechanism of beef/veal advertising needs to be improved if this industry expects
to reverse the current problems with media coverage
and its impact on beef demand.

6. Expenditures and the negative media
The AIDS model in budget share form based on
meat expenditures enables one to investigate what really drives changes in fresh meat demand: negative
TV coverage or the level of expenditures on all meats?
Changes in the total expenditures on meats (i.e. the y 1
in the AIDS model from Eqs. (1) and (3)) along with
changes in the amount of negative TV coverage are
simulated in Fig. Sa and b.
What is most apparent in both graphs is that changes
in total expenditure on meats generate considerably
greater shifts in market shares than result from negative press. In Fig. Sa, beef/veal's share of the meat
market, even with the most negative levels of press,
increases from 32 to over 37% as total expenditures
range from 50 to 150% of the current level. As the
number of negative press stories declines the share increases to over 38%.

Clearly, the beef/veal industry would benefit from
an overall growth in consumer spending on all meats
regardless of negative TV coverage. Therefore, the
growth in total expenditures could far outweigh the
negative press impacts. In contrast, pork/mixture loses
market share as total meat expenditures increase,
with the shares declining from over 48 to near 42%
(Fig. Sb). Pork industry gains from negative TV coverage are easily seen in the form of the positive slope
on the bottom left axis in Fig. Sb.

7. Simulating cumulative expenditure changes
In all of the previous figures, responses were simulated using mean values as the base. An alternative
approach to showing the impacts is to calculate the
change in expenditures over the actual data period
(January 1995 to December 1998) assuming that a particular condition had not occurred. For example, the
model allows one to predict expenditure on each meat
type under actual market conditions and then compare
this to a situation in which there were no negative
press stories. The cumulative expenditure changes
would be attributed to the negative press in this example. In Fig. 6 such simulations have been completed
for each of the investigated media efforts. Changes in
expenditure are shown for beef/veal, pork/mixture and

poultry under the condition that the media efforts were
zero compared to the actual ones.
The first three bars in Fig. 6 measure the cumulative impact of the TV coverage of meat-health issues.
Negative press resulted in an overall lower expenditure of about 195 million € for beef/veal and 125
million € for poultry, both to the benefit of pork
expenditures (the positive middle bar). The picture
for negative press and advertising together is fairly
similar, which confirms the finding that advertising
effects are modest compared with the impact of negative press. The beef/veal expenditure gain attributed
to beef/veal advertising amounts to some 40 million
€, which is in absolute value almost five times lower
that the impact of negative press. Pork/mixture is the
major loser as a result of beef/veal advertising and
beef is the major loser as a result of pork advertising. It is noteworthy that the combined impact of
beef and pork advertising resulted in small losses of
expenditures for both meats to the benefit of poultry.
What is most noteworthy is the ranking of these impacts as shown from the left to the right in Fig. 6, with
the dominance of negative press on beef and poultry
and the clear gains to the pork industry. Generic and
brand advertisement have effects of the expected signs,
but are of little consequence compared with negative
press.

8. Conclusions
This paper has focused on investigating the impact
of negative TV coverage and advertising on meat consumption through the specification and estimation of
a three-equation AIDS model with monthly data covering the period of January 1995 to December 1998.
Negative press coverage of meat-health issues entered the model as a five-period lagged and weighted
index based on the number of negative minus positive TV news reports. The parameter estimates and
resulting elasticity coefficients are plausible and
largely consistent with classical demand theory. The
own-price elasticity coefficients of the fresh meats
are relatively low compared with previously reported
elasticity coefficients from other countries. Although
the current model does not deal with parameter
changes, it appears reasonable to assume that fresh
meat demand has become less price sensitive in an

era dominated by continuous reports about potential
health risks.
Simulations based on our AIDS estimates provide
in-depth empirical insights into the impact of negative
press and advertising. Findings from this time series
analysis show the immense impact of negative publicity and largely corroborate previous research by Verbeke et al. (2000) based on cross-sectional data from
a sample of Belgian meat consumers. The simulations
based on the model estimates clearly extend beyond
the estimation of elasticity coefficients and herewith
respond to a major criticism by Ward (1999, p. 518) on
the use of many demand models in empirical research.
The findings are most alarming with respect to television publicity, i.e. TV coverage of the potential adverse health effects of meat consumption, and are not
very promising with respect to advertising. The latter may be not so surprising. Following Forker and
Ward (1993), some advertising expenditure threshold
may have to be exceeded before any significant results
are noticed. This certainly holds in times dominated
by extensive negative media coverage that largely outweighs similar amounts of positive coverage aimed at
consumer reassurance. While the own beef advertising effect is found to be statistically insignificant, the
hypothesis that television publicity negatively affects
beef/veal demand is statistically supported and fully
explored in the simulations. At the mean media index
level, beef TV advertising expenditures would need to
be increased to about five times their mean level in order to maintain beef expenditure share. Shifts are seen
towards consuming pork/mixture, both as a result of a
response to negative beef/veal press and positive own
advertising effects.
The impact of the negative press and advertising
is also illustrated by the calculation of expenditure
gains or losses at the industry level. Again a negative
press/advertising ratio of about 5 is found, with the total beef expenditure gain attributed to own advertising
being five times lower in absolute value than the total loss resulting from negative publicity. The results
clearly show the dramatic impact of negative press on
the beef/veal industry, as well as the relatively modest
performance of brand and generic advertising efforts.
Increases in total meat expenditures could outweigh
the negative press impacts for the beef industry. However, total consumer spending on meat, first, tends to
slowly decrease rather than increase over time, and

W Verbeke, R. W Ward/ Agricultural Economics 25 (2001) 359-374

second, is difficult to influence directly by the affected
sectors. Therefore, eliminating the grounds for negative press, and searching for better and more effective
ways of communicating emerge as recommendations
for the meat industry, and particularly for the beef
sector.
