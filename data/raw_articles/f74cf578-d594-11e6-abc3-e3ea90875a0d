ABSTRACT

A stochastic frontier production function with tlme-varying technical
efficiencies is estimated using panel data from ICRISAT's Village Level
Studies in three Indian villages. A Cobb-Douglas functional form is
initially defined in which linear combinations of irrigated and unirrigated
land and hired and family labour are included as explanatory variables.
Given the sp~cifications of a linearized version of the Cobb-Douglas
production frontier with coefficients which are a linear function of time,
the hypothesis of time-invariant technical inefficiency is rejected for one
of the three villages involved. The hypothesis of time--invariant
coefficients of the explanatory variables is rejected for two of the three
villages. Further, the hypothesis that hired and. family labour are equally
productive is accepted in only one of the three villages.
The technical efficiencies of individual farms exhibited considerable
variation, both in the cases of time-varying and time-invariant technical
efficiencies.

Battese (1991) presents a review of

the concepts and models which have been suggested and surveys applicatlons
'rthich have appeared in agricultural economics Journa:s.
Frontier production functions assume the existence of technical
inefficiency of the differ'ent firms involved in production such that, for
specific values of factor inputs t the levels of productIon are less than what
would be the case if the firms were fully technically efficient.

The

majority of the earlier applications of frontier production functions
involved cross-sectional data.

However, more recently attempts have been

made to apply frontier production functions in the analysis of time-serles
data on firms involved in production.

Initially the firm effects associated

with the existence of technical inefficiency were assumed to be timeinva3'iant random variables or independent. and identlcally dIstributed over
time.

Models for frontier production functions have been proposed in which

2

the firm effects associated with technical efficiency are. assumed to be time
varying [see Kumbhakar (1990), Cornwell. Schmidt and SIckles (1990) and

The Econometric Model
The model proposed by Battese and Coelll (1991) assumes that the

production of firms Is defined by a stochastic frontlerproduction fUnction

In which the firm effects are an exponential function of time, such that the
firms are not required to be observed In all the tIme periods involved.

The

model is defined by

The model for the firm effects, defined by equation (2), specifies that the

This situation

would indicate a decline in the level of technical Inefficiency and, hence,
an increase in technical efficiency over time.
As stated in Bat tese and Coelll (1991 L the exponential speciflcation
of the behaviour of the firm effect.s over time is a rigid parameterization.
It implies that the technical efficiency of the firms involved,

Kumbhakar (1990) assumed that the firm effects, Ult' were a more

general exponential function of time involving two parameters.

No emplrlcal

applications of Kumbhakar's (1990) model have yet appeared because the model
has not been successfully programmed.

Cornwell, Schmidt and

Slck~es

(1990)

as.sumed that the firm effects were a quadratic functlon of time in which the
coef.ficientswere random draws from a trivariate normal distribution.
The model for the firm effects, U , defined by equation (2), assumes

that the ranklngs of the firm effects remain the same over time.

Battese and Coelli (1991) illustrated the use of the FRONTIER program
with the analysis of a subset of the data on a. panel of sample farms from the
village of Aurepalle in India.

III this paper, we consider the complete data

sets obtained over the ten-year perlod 1n which ICRISAT collected data from
the three villages of Aurepalle, Kanzaraand Shirapur.
3.

ICRISAT's Village Level Studies
The data used in this study were obtained from the International Crops

Res.earch Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (JCIUSAT) near Hyderabad 1n the
Indian .state of Andhra Pradesh.

The data are from the village level studies

(VLS) In which ICRISAT personnel collected a range of data .from .households
engaged in agricultural production in different villages in India.

As a part

of its mandate. ICRISAT initiated its village level studies 1n 1915 to obtain
reliable data on traditional agricultural methods in the Semi-Arid Trppics
(SAT) of India so that improved technological methods could be introduced
[see Jodha, Asokan and Ryan (1911) and Binswanger .and Jodha (1918)].
The three villages involved in the VLS studies of ICRISAT were selected
from districts which represented the broad agrocllmatlc subregions in the SAT
of India.

The main fact.ors considered in the selection of the districts

included soil types, rainfall and cropping pattern.

Accessibility to

agricul tural universities ,')r research stations and development programs and
proximity to the ICRISAT's headquarters at Patancheru near Hyderabad were
also given important consideration.

Within the selected dlstricts, talukas

(subdlvisions of a district) were selected which represented the typical
characteristlcs in terms of land-use pattern,cropping, irrigation,
livestock, infra-structural development. population, etc.

Villages which

were located near large towns or have special government or other programs
were not considered In the sample.

The data used in this study were

6

collected from three villages, Aurepalle, shirapur and Kanzara, during the
years 1975 to 1985.

Data on factor inputs and total productIon were. obtained

for a random. sample of households in each village.
All households in each vlllage were divided into two main groups.

The

agricultural labour group consisted of households operating less than 0.2
hectares of operated land and the cultivator group consisted of households
operating at least 0.2 hectares of land.

The cultivator group was further

classified into three equal groups and ranked as small, medium and large
farmers depending on the size of their holdings.
A random sample of ten households was selected from each group of
.If

farmers including the agricultural labour group so that 40 sample farmers
were selected from each village.

However, this stUdy does not include the

agricultural labour group for the purpose of the analysis of the frontIer
production function.

During the ten-year period involved, some households

which were originally cl:l.ssified as labour farmers became small farmers In
the later years and hence were included in the sample.

Farmers who refused

to provide information or ceased to be members of the sample were replaced by
other farmers.

Hence the numbers of sample households in each village, as

well as the number of time-series observations for each household, were not
necessarily

vill~ges

of Aurepalle, Shirapur and Kanzara were selected from the

districts of Mahbubnagar, sholapur and Akola, respectively, and are located
approximately 70 km south, 336 km west nnd 550 km north of Hyderabad,
respectively.

There were 3141 people in Aurepalle, 2017 people in shirapur

and 1380 people In Kanzara in 1985.
Considerable soil heterogeneIty is a characteristic of the SAT of India.
Aurepalle has medium and shallow alfisols (red soils) with low water
retention capacity.

Soil heterogeneity is remarkably high in Aurepalle

7

compared to Shlr.apurand .Kanzara.

Shirapur has medIum and deep vertisols

(black soils) with high moist11re retention capacity_

Kanzara ha$ mainly

medlum-dee·p black soils and shallow vertisols with .medium moisture retention
capacity.

Soils In Kanzara. are more homogeneous than in Aurepalle and

Shirapur.
Rainfall in the SAT of India is generally erratic In distribution and
the mean annual rainfall ranges from about 400mm to 1200mm.

In the year's

1975 to 1985 the average annual rainfall was 611mm f.or AUrepal.i.e, 629mm
for Shirapurand 850 mm for Kanzara.

Rainfall is very erratic and uncertain

in Aurepalle and Shirapur.

Sorghum, pearl millet,

The high-yielding variety paddy 1s mostly grown under

irrigated condltions.

Of the total cropped land, about 21 per cent is

irrigated in Aurepalle, compared to 9 per cent and 7 per cent in the villages
of Shlrapur and Kanzara, respectively.

There exists a large variation in the cropping patterns among the three
villages.

This variation is associated with differences in .s01l

heterogenelty,rainfall pattern and other factors between the villages.
Shirapur has the highest proportion of area cropped under cereals of whIch
lQcal sorghum contributes about 62 per cent of the total cultivated land in
the village.

The area under cereals in Aurepalle and Kanzara is .about 50 and

30 per cent respectively.

Oil crops play an important role in Aurepalle,

where castor contributes about 35 per cent of the total cropped land,
followed by sorghum and paddy which contribute about 20 per cent each.
Cotton Isa sole crop in Kanzara.

It occupies about 40 per cent of the.

cultivated land in the village.
A sImilar variation exists in the marketed output of crops in the three
villages.

The crops which have the largest proportion of marketed output are

However, the use of labour (family

and hired) varies from village to village, as well as from year to year,
dependIng on rainfall, solI type, type of crop, irrigation, etc.
households heavily depend on hired labour to cultivate their land.

AurepalleandKanzara, hired labour provIdes; the .maJority (60 to 80 per cent)
of the total labour used in crop productIon.

The high demand. f()rhired

cotton pIcking in Kclnzara (see Walker and Ryan (1990) L

The labour force

comprises men. women and children, but the latter only mak.ea very small
contribution.

The contrIbution of men to the. total family labour in crop

production Is substantially higher than women, while women dominate the hired
labour ma.rke t.
In all the villages, cultivation such as plowing, harrowing and
intercuituring is carried out using animal draft power, usually involving
bullocks.

However, many households which own small areas of land do not have

bullocks~

Seasonal hiring Is common. especially by small farmers.

It Is

most common in Shirapur where bullock-to-Iand ratios are slgnlficantly lower
than in the other two vlllilges [Walker and Ryan (1990»).

Single bullock

owners often pool their bullocks and cultivate on an exchange basis.
Fertilizer is used almost entIrely for irrigated agriculture in the
study villages.

However. the use of fertilizer in dry land agriculture is

increasing in the rainfall-assured village of Kanzara and, to some extent, in
Aurepalle.

For example, the use of fertilizer in dryland farming has

increased from 3 per cent in 1975 ....76 to 50 per cent by 1985-86.

However,

application rates per hectare remained very low.
Manure plays an important role in the study villages.
apply manure to their land every year.

Manyfarmers

However, the supply of manure 1.s

constrained by limited availabilit:i ,.. f fodder which restricts livestock
production as well as the use of its byproduct f.or fuel.
Pesticides are applied mainly in irrigated agriculture. although the
expenditure on fertilizers is much higher (about nine times) than the
expenditure on pesticides.

Pesticides are widely applied 1n the villages of

10
Aurepalle and Kanzara.
The .following sectlon deals with the empirical analyses of the data
obtalnedfrom the three villages, Aurepalle, Shirapur and Kanzara.

It is

expected that different parameter values and technicEl1 efficiencies are
likely because of the SUbstantial differences in the agro-climatic
environments among the three villages.

The Frontler Production Function

A stochastic frontier production function of Cobb-Douglas type, which
involves four basic explanatory varlables, is initially considered in this
study. The frontier production function is defined by:

The values of output (and input costs) were deflated using price indices
which were constructed from data on prices and quantities of commodities
grown in the three villages.

conversion rule that female an.1 child labour hours are equivalent to 0.75
and 0.50 male hours, respectively. These factors are used by ICRISAT in
empirical analyses involving labour of different family memb~rs.

observation; and
V1l and U1t are random variables having the distributional properties,
as defined for equations (1) and (2).
The model, defined by equation (6), is formulated from the work of
Bardhan (1973), Deolalikar and Vijverberg (1983, 1987) and Batte$e, Coell!
and Colby (1989).

Bardhan (1973) considered a production function of

Cobb-Douglas type in which the variables, tot.al labour (family plus hired
labour hours) and the proportion of hired labour to total labour, were
separately included as explanatory variables.

Bardhan (1973) used Indian

farm-level data and concluded that hired and family labour were
heterogeneous in some cases.

Deolalikar and Vijverbe.rg (1983) also considered

unirrigated and irrigated land in theIr production function.

They concluded

that the best model had a weighted average of the unirrigated and irrigated
areas operated as the land variable.
Batt-ese, Coelli and Colby (1989) considered the model in which labour
and land variables were the weIghted averages of their respective hired and
family labour and unirrigated and irrigated land.

Battese. Coelli and Colby

12

(1989) included cost of inputs in the Cobb-Douglas production function.
provided input costs were positive.

However, if input costs were not

positive (as Is the case for a large proportion of farms In this study), then
input custs were not included in the function.

This dummy-variable approach

may be criticised because as input cost approaches zero then productlon
should also approach zero according to the Cobb-Douglas productIon function.
The modified production function (6), in which costs of inputs enters
exponentially, implies that as costs approach zero, the term, exp(Costs),
approaches one. not zero.

Hence, the model (6) implies that farms with

positive input costs have a different intercept value than those with Zero
input costs (of those which are measured), but the latter farms do not have
zero level of production.
The model of equation (6) is alternatively expressed by

Empirical Results
A summary of the da.ta on the different varlables in thefrontler

production .function is given in Table 1.

It is evident from these statistics

that Aurepalle farmers tend to be smaller in terms of value of output and
total land operated.

Kanzara farmer.s had the highest mean value of output,

human labour and bullock labour.

Kanzara farmers have the least amount of

irrigation because of the relatively assured rainfall. whereas Aurepalle
farmers have the greatest amount of irrigation because of the prevalence of
growing paddy .
.Bullock labour is used considerably more in Kanzara and Aurepalle than
in Shlrapur.

Cost of inputs had a high proportion of zero observations in.

all three villages and so the sample means were not very large in all three
cases.
The stochastic frontler productlon function (8) consists of ten
parameters, six beIng associated with the explanatory varIables of the
function and four being parameters whIch specify the distributions of the
random varIables, Vit. and U1t .

The maximum-lIkelIhood estimates for the

parameters of the frontier production functions with time-invariant
parameters for the three villages are presented in Table 2.
Tests of hypotheses about the distribution of the random variables
associated with the existence of technical inefficiency and residual error

Hence the null hypotheses that

1)

and

J.L

were zero,

ei ther individually or together., are of interest if the stochasticfrontler
function is significantly different from the tradltional response function.
Tests of these various hypotheses associated with the parameters, '1, Il
and 11, are presented in Table 3.

The generalized likelihood-ratio test

statistic is calculated after obtained the logllkellhood value associated
with the restricted maximum-likelihood estimates for the special cases when
the appropriate parameters are zero.
The results presented in Table 3 imply that, given the specifications of
the stochastic frontier production function (8) with time-invariant
parameters, then the model is significantly different .from the traditional
response function for all three villages.

Further, for farmers in Aurepalle

and Shirapur no sub-model in which the parameters, /land 11, are zero, either
individually or Jointly, is an adequate representation of the data.

That is,

technical inefficiency not only exists, but the farm effects are not time
$.nvariant. nor is the half-normal distribution an adequate repr.esentatlon.
However, for farmers in Kanzara, the null hypothesis that the farm effects
ar(} time invariant and have half-normal distributions would be accepted
und(~r

the model assumptions.

The above model for the stochastic front.ier production function
associated with panel data on sample farmers from the three villages is
likely to be inappropriate.

That is, the assumption that the coefficients of

the explanatory variables In the frontier function (8) are time invariant,
but that the farm effects associated with technical inefficiency have a
particular time-varying structure may be regarded as objectionable..

Hence we

now consider a modification of the model in which the coefficients of the
.explanator:, variables In the frontier productlon fUnction are time varying
and are, in .fact, a linear function of t.he year of observation.

That is, we

For this more general specification of the stochastic frontier
production function, there would be interest in testing if the coefficients
of the production frontier were time invariant. or the elasticities with
respect to the factor inputs were time invariant,after investigating whether
the farm effects were time invariant and/or the half-normal distribution was
a reasonable assumption.
The maximum-likelihood estimates for the parameters of the stochastic
frontier model (9)-(10) with time-varying parameters and time-varying farm
effects (2) are presented in Table 4.

Tests ·of hypotheses about the

distribution of the farm effects associated with the stochastic frontier
production functions with time-varyIng coeffIcients are obtained from the
data in Table 5.
The statistics in Table 5 suggest the following conclusions about the
technical inefficiencies .associated with farmers in the three villages:
(1)

Given the specifications of the stochastic frontier production

function with time-varying coefficients (9)-(10), the frontIer is not
significantly different from the traditional response function for farmers In

Hence it could be concluded that technical inefficiency Is not

evident for Aurepallefarmers.

(il)

For Shirapur farmers, the frontier model is significantly different

from the traditional response function, but the null hypotheses, that the
farm effects associated with technical inefficiency are time invariant and/or
have half-normal distribution, would be rejected.
(iii)

For Kanzara farmers, the null hypothesis that the farm effects are

time invariant would be accepted by the data.
Given these conclusions about the time-varying nature of the farm
effects (when present) in the stochastic frontier production 'functions,
hypotheses as to whether the coefficients of the frontiers1.re time invariant
are considered.

The relevant test statistics are presented in Table 6.

From these results, it follows that the null hypothesis that the coefficients
of the explanatory variables, other than year of observation, are time
invariant would be accepted at the one-percent level of significance for
Aurepalle farmers only.
Given the specificli.tions of the stochastic frontier production functions
wi th time-varying parameters and technical effici.encies which are considered
in this paper, the estimatect. parameters for the preferred frontier models are
p~~esented

in Table 7.

Hence only farmers in Shirapur have time-varying

technical efficiencies, whereas farmers in Kanzara have time-invariant
technical efficiencies.

Predictions for the corresponding technical

efficiencies for Shirapur and Kanzara farmers are presented in Tables 8 and
9, respectively.

The technical efficiencies of Shirapur farmers in the first

year of observation showed great variability (from 0.191 to 0.898) but
increased over the ten-year period to as high as 0.985.

However, the Kanzara

farmers had constant technical efficiency over time which varied from 0.445
to 0.817. In both cases, the level of technical inefflciencyof th
involved was considerable for most farmers.

A stated in the discussion of the front!er production function with
time-invariant coefficients of the explanatory varIables, defIned by equation
(8), 1f family and hired labour were equally productive, then the parameter,
b2 ,woUld have value 1.0 and so the coefficients of the labour-ratio
variable, HLit../Labour It t and its interaction with year of observation would
be zero in the production frontIer wIth time-varying coefficients of the
explanatory variables.

Teststatlstlcs .for the null

hypothes~s

of equal

proQuctivlty of family and hired labour are presented in Table 10, given the
speclfications of the pr.eferred frontIer productIon functions for the three
villages, reported in Table 1.

These statistlcs imply that the hypothesis of

equal productivity of family and hired labour would be rejected for the
villages of Aurepal1e and Shlrapur. but

accept~d

for the village of Kanzara.

It is noted that the coefficlent of the logarithm of Bullock labour in
the preferred production frontiers have negative values for all three
villages, but the coefficient is significantly different from zero in
Aurepalle only.

Negative elasticities of bullock labour have been found in

other studies [e .. g., Saini (1979), Battese, Coell! and Colby (1989) and
Battese and Coelli (1991)].

Various explanations have been suggested for

Conclusions
Our application of frontier ,production functions. in the analysis of

panel data from three Indian villages has indicated a number of important
findings:
(1)

When the data are' analysed using a frontier model with coefficients

that are constant over time (including the intercept parameter), then
technical inefficiencies are found to .be highly significant in all three
villages and to be time varyIllg in two of the three villages;
(li)

If the .frontier production function contains time-varying

coefficients (intercept andela\,ticities) then different conclusions about
technical inefficiency were obtalned in the different villages.

In

Aurepalle. the frontier function was not significantly diff.erent from the
traditional response function (which can be estimated efficiently pyordinary
least-squares regression).

In Kanzara technical inefficiency was not

Significantly different over time.

However. in Shirapur it could not be

concluded that technical efficiency ",'as tl.me invariant for the farmers
involved.
(iIi)

The hypotheSis that the coefficients of the explanatory variables

(other than the intercept) w.ere time invariant was rejected for two of the
three villages.
The above results indicate that the inclusi.on of year-of-observationas
an explanatory variable In the frontier model to account for neutral
technological change, provided that it is appropriate, does not necessarily
mean that technical inefficiency wIll be found to be removed from the data.
Our analysis of the farm-level data from the three vlliages has not
proceeded to the point of being able to explain or justify the different
results which have been obtaIned for the three villages.
investigations are required to deal with such issues.

Further

30

The applica.tion of the frontier production function models considered in
this paper has not included the possIble effect of farm-or farmer-specific
varIables. such as .education of the farmer, access to credIt. etc.

Further

analyses incorporating such variables In the frontier models is being
undertaken.
The empirical application of stochastic frontier production functions
for the analysis of panel data requires that the deterministic component of
the

fun~~tions

be appropriately modelled, in addl ti.on to the stochastic

elements associated with technical inefficiency and random error.
obvlously a challenging exercise.
