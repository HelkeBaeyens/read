Averting a food crisis: private imports and public targeted
distribution in Bangladesh after the 1998 flood

Abstract
The 1998 flood in Bangladesh caused a shortfall of 2.2 million tonnes (mill.t) in the rice production and threatened the
food security of tens of millions of households. Despite the best efforts of donors and the government, the public distribution
ofrice and wheat was only 188,000t more than originally planned for July 1998 to April1999.
However, a major food crisis was averted as private imports, made possible by trade liberalisation in the early 1990s,
stabilised market prices and supplies. The government's direct distribution programs, though small compared to private
imports, nonetheless increased access to food by poor households. Household survey data indicate that immediate relief
efforts were well targeted to flood-affected households, as were transfers from NGOs. Vulnerable Group Feeding (VGF), a
medium-term program, was not targeted well to households directly exposed to the flood, though the program was relatively
well targeted to poor households.
More broadly, the Bangladesh experience with the 1998 flood shows that in a liberalised trade regime, where private imports
respond to price signals, food aid's contribution to the total availability of food may be minimal. However, foreign assistance
in kind or in cash, can provide resources for subsidised, targeted distribution to food-insecure households - assistance not
possible otherwise under tight government budget constraints. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
The 1998 flood, dubbed 'the flood of the century'
in Bangladesh, covered 51% of the country at its peak,
caused a shortfall of 2.2 million tonnes (mill.t) in rice
production and threatened the food security of tens
of millions of households. Government appeals for
assistance in August 1998 brought forth pledges of
1.083 mill.t of food aid for flood relief and rehabilitation from donors, providing the food grain for an

expansion of targeted public distribution. Despite the
best efforts of donors and government, the public distribution of rice and wheat was only 188,000t more
than originally planned for July 1998 to April 1999.
Nonetheless, a major food crisis was averted. This paper explores how.
Unfortunately, food scarcity and famines are not
new to Bangladesh. The great Bengal famine of 1943
killed an estimated three million people in what is now
Bangladesh and eastern India (Dreze and Sen, 1989).
Drought-related crop failures and a shortage offoreign
exchange for impmis resulted in high rice prices and
food shortages that contributed to a sharp increase
in mortality in 1974 (Ravallion, 1990). Major floods

in 1987 and 1988, though not leading to a famine,
contributed to crop shortages and sharp increases in
rice prices, mitigated by a large increase in public food
grain distribution.
However, supply (or availability) of food is not the
sole determinant of food security. Food entitlements
of households (their legal means and resources to acquire food: own production, other income, public and
private transfers, and borrowing) determine their access to food (Sen, 1982). 1 As is described below, the
availability of food grains in Bangladesh following the
floods of 1998 was maintained mainly through private
sector imports, made possible by trade liberalisation
in the early 1990s. Government and NGO programs
contributed mainly by increasing access to food by the
poor.
Section 2 begins with a review of the food grain
economy of Bangladesh and major changes in government food policy in the 1990s. The effects of the
1998 flood on the domestic production and the role of
public and private sector imports in augmenting the
supply and stabilising the prices are then discussed.
Section 3 focuses on the household access to food,
presenting data from a survey of rural households in
flood-affected areas. The analysis focuses on the efficiency of targeting of government programs and the
relative contribution of the public, NGO and private
transfers in increasing the household access to food.
Section 4 concludes the discussion.

2. Food availability after the flood

Aggregate food availability in Bangladesh is low,
even in years of good harvests. In 1996-1997,
the most recent year of good harvests, total calorie consumption was only 2085 cal per person per
day, 72.8% from rice and 9.2% from wheat (FAO
Food Balance Sheet, 1997). Three crops of rice
are cultivated in Bangladesh: aman, typically transplanted during the monsoons in June-July and harvested in November-December; boro, transplanted in
December-January and harvested in May-June; and
1 In fact, the great Bengal famine was not caused by a crop
failure, but was largely due to an increase in urban demand for
food during a war-time economic boom that raised food prices for
the rural poor (Dreze and Sen, 1989).

aus, often directly sown in March-April and harvested
in July-August. Prior to the 1998 flood, aman and
boro rice production in the July 1998 to June 1999
fiscal year were expected to be 9.5 and 7.8 mill.t, 49
and 41%, respectively, of anticipated total production
of 19.2 mill.t. Due to the adoption of green revolution
technology, (including improved seeds, irrigation of
boro rice in the dry season and fertiliser), rice production has increased rapidly, particularly since the late
1980s, and the country is nearly self-sufficient in rice.
In the 1990s, rice imports averaged only 686,000 t
per year, 4.0% of net rice availability and 3.5% of net
food grain availability. Wheat imports (about 64.3%
in the form of food aid) averaged 52.9 and 7.7% of
net wheat and food grain availability, respectively
(see Ahmed et al., 2000).
Prior to the April 1994, the liberalisation of private sector rice imports (and the 1992liberalisation of
private sector wheat imports), shortfalls in food grain
production were met through food aid, government
commercial imports and draw down of public stocks.
However, since 1994 the private sector imports of rice,
mainly from India (which liberalised its private sector rice exports in late 1994), have added to the domestic supplies in years of below-average harvests in
Bangladesh. Thus, the import parity price of rice from
Indian markets has provided a ceiling on rice prices
in Bangladesh (Fig. 1). 2
The market prices of rice had been high in the first
half of 1998, even before the flood, because of a poor
1997-1998 aman rice harvest in November/December
1997. As domestic prices rose, beginning in December 1997, it became profitable for the private sector
to import rice from India (mainly by truck and rail
across the land borders). Government policy encouraged private sector imports of rice by removing the tariffs on imports, limiting the open market sales, giving
instructions to expedite the clearance of rice imports
through customs and abstaining from the re-imposition
of anti-hoarding laws. An excellent boro rice harvest
in the mid-1998, brought a temporary respite from
high prices of rice in Bangladesh, but the prices soon
rose again to import parity levels as the flood waters gradually spread across the country from mid-July
1998 to early-September 1998. Initial flood damage to

the standing aus crop was small (only 280,000 t), but
the flood also destroyed seedlings for the following
November's aman rice crop, ultimately leading to a
1.76 mill.t aman crop loss (Table 1). However, private
sector imports exceeded 200,000 t of rice per month
from August 1998 to April1999, totalling 2.377 mill.t
over this period, more than offsetting the estimated
total rice production shortfall of 2.2 mill.t. 3
In comparison to the private sector rice and wheat
imports, public distribution of food grain was relatively small, due to relatively low wheat stock levels at the time of the flood, uncertainties regarding
food aid arrivals, problems with government procurement of rice in international markets and a perceived
need to maintain sufficient stocks to help stabilise markets in the event of possible severe short-term shortages. 4 Although rice distribution was greater than
3 Comparisons of estimated rice demand with total rice availability and comparisons of Bangladesh and Indian data on the volume
of rice trade between the two countries suggest that the volume
of private imports for the April 1998-March 1999 period may
have been overstated by as much as 1.0 mill.t (out of an official
Government of Bangladesh total of 3.2 mill.t). See Dorosh (2001)
and Del Ninno et al. (2001).
4 Dorosh (2001) and Del Ninno et a!. (2001) give further details
of government food policy following the flood.

originally planned in the months immediately following the flood (July-September), rice distribution was
cut back once the food aid wheat became available,
partly because international procurement through open
tenders failed to acquire the desired quantities. Ultimately, only 399,000 t of rice was distributed from
July 1998 to April1999, 333,000t less than originally
programmed in the pre-flood distribution plan. Private
sector rice imports, equal to 2.42 mill.t in this period
(using official Government of Bangladesh (GOB) figures), were thus 6.1 times larger than government rice
distribution. 5
Increased inflows of food aid did enable a large
increase in the public distribution of wheat from
905,000t to an eventual 1.603 mill.t for the entire
July 1998 to June 1999 fiscal year, but in November 1998 wheat distribution was limited by the slow
arrival of food aid and low government stocks. The
major role of public distribution of food grain during
and after the flood was not one of increasing total
supplies but rather one of targeting relief to those
in need.
5 Using a lower estimate of 1.42 rnill.t (1.0 rnill.t less than GOB
official figures), private sector rice imports were still 3.5 times
larger than government rice distribution.

3. Household access to food: public distribution
and other transfers
Two major channels dominated government food
relief efforts following the flood: gratuitous relief
(GR), designed to provide emergency relief to disaster victims; and vulnerable group feeding (VGF),
aimed at assisting the households over a longer period
(ultimately, from September 1998 to April 1999). 6
Immediate short-term relief through GR was targeted
by location. In contrast, the VGF program included all
the areas of the country (both flooded and non-flood
affected areas), and was administratively targeted
to poor households through selection by local committees (Del Ninno and Roy, 1999a). However, the
sizes of these programs were limited, both by the
available wheat stocks (up to early November when
the government commercial imports and food aid arrivals added to government stocks) and the financial
cost of the programs (covered to a large extent by
food aid).
Major flood relief efforts began with the provision
of 20,400 t of rice through GR in the flood-affected
thanas in August 1998 and an additional 30,800 t
of rice in September. In addition, the VGF program
began on a large scale in August with an initial
distribution of 1.3 million cards, each entitling the
holder to 8 kg of rice per month. During August
and September, a total of 27,500 t of rice were distributed through this program. At 8 kg per card, an
estimated 1.35 and 2.13 million households received
the VGF rations in August and September, respectively. Almost no wheat was distributed through relief channels in the initial months of the flood. At
the urging of the World Food Programme (WFP),
the GOB expanded the VGF program to 4 million
cards with an allotment of 16 kg of grain per card,
half rice and half wheat in October, and all wheat
thereafter.
Data from a survey of 757 households conducted
in November-December 1998 (about 2.5 months after
the floodwaters had receded) in seven flood-affected
thanas were used to provide evidence of the extent to

in December 1998, following the aman rice harvest, when soils
were dry enough to permit manual earthwork in the building of

which the GRand VGF programs were well targeted. 7
As shown in Table 2, average per capita monthly expenditures during the period of 15 July to 14 November 1998 were only 755.2 Taka (US$ 15.64 at the
November 1998 exchange rate of 48.3 Taka per US$).
Sixty-eight percent of all the households, and 85.5%
of the households in the lowest per capita expenditure
quintile, owned less than 0.5 acres (0.20 ha) of land.
A total of 67.1% of the households in the first
quintile received some type of government transfer, 38.8% of these households received VGF grain
(mainly wheat) and 31.6% received GR grain (mainly
rice). VGF was fairly well-targeted by expenditure.
Nonetheless, 17.2 and 11.2% of the households in
the top two quintiles were participants. However, the
size of these transfers was relatively small. The average value of VGF grain received by the participating
households in October and November 1998 was 202.0
Taka per household per month, equal to only 5.0% of
total household expenditures. For VGF participants in
the lowest quintile, these transfers were more significant, equal to 10.5% of total household expenditures.
Table 3 presents data on household expenditures and
transfers according to an index of household exposure
to the flood. This index measures the direct exposure
to the flood at the household level, taking into account
four factors: (1) the depth of water in the homestead;
(2) the depth of water in the house; (3) the duration
(number of days) of water in the house; and (4) the
number of days away from home due to the flood.
For each of these four components, we created an
index ranging from 0 to 5. The total flood exposure
index, equal to the sum of the component variables,
ranges in value from 0 to 18. Finally, a categorical
variable was defined according to the value of the flood
exposure index: 0 =not exposed to the flood, 1-5 =
7 The seven flood-affected thanas, representing five out of six
divisions of the country, were selected according to two major
criteria: the severity of flood as determined by the Water Board
and the percentage of poor people in the district in which the
thana is located. Given these two major criteria, some thanas that
were in the samples of earlier studies were purposively selected.
Households were randomly selected using a multiple stage probability sampling technique (with the exception of households in one
thana that were in the sample of an earlier study). In all, approximately six households were selected per village, 36 per union,
and 108 per thana, for a final sample size of 757 households in
126 villages (see Del Ninno and Roy, 1999b, for a more detailed
description of the sampling frame).

exposed to the flood and ~ 11 = very severely exposed
to the flood (for further details see Del Ninno and Roy,
1999b). 8
All together 57.6% of the households in the sample were severely exposed to the flood, while 28.9%
were not exposed to the flood. The flood affected both
rich and poor and there is essentially no correlation
between the severity of flood-exposure and the expenditures as indicated by flood exposure by per capita
expenditure cjuintile (Table 2) or per capita expenditure by the degree of flood exposure (Table 3).
The VGF program was not effectively targeted according to flood exposure, even in the flood-affected
thanas studied. A total of 18.7% of the households
not directly exposed to the flood received cards, only

index appear to be quite robust. Similar results were obtained using
a different flood exposure index that uses only three variables and

severely exposed to the flood (24.5%). In contrast,
only 9.6% of the households not directly exposed to
the flood received assistance through the short term
GR relief program, compared with 36.7% of the very
severely exposed households.
In terms of leakages, GR was better targeted towards flood-exposed households than was VGF. Only
11.4% ofthe GR recipients, as compared with 24.7%
of the VGF recipients, were not directly exposed to
the flood. Neither program achieved broad coverage.
However, 69.3% of the flood-exposed households did
not receive GR, while 76.6% did not receive VGF.
Though VGF was better targeted to the poor than GR,
50.9% of the VGF recipients were relatively non-poor
households that belonged to the top 60% of the per
capita expenditure distribution or that owned 0.5 acres
or more of land.
In contrast to VGF, the transfers from NGOs were
particularly well-targeted to the households exposed
to the flood. A total of 24.5% of the very severely

Average transfer received over the 4 month period, 15 July 1998 to 15 November 1998.

flood-exposed households received transfers from
NGOs, compared with only 2.7% of the non-flood
exposed households. The value of transfers per household was also nearly 10 times larger for the very
severely flood-exposed households, 20.5 Taka per
month compared with 2.1 Taka per month. The excellent targeting of NGO transfers to flood-exposed
households may be largely explained by the types of
programs undertaken by the NGOs at this time; relief
programs to the flood victims, mainly in the areas
that had been more severely affected by the flood. In
the thanas surveyed in late 1998, there were no major
non-flood relief NGO programs involving transfers
in kind or in cash in operation Private transfers were
not highly correlated with flood exposure and it is
notable that the poorest 20% of households received
only about 115 as much transfers per household (23.8
Taka per month) as did the average household in the
sample 121.5 Taka per month (see Table 2).
The analysis of the determinants of participation in
GR and VGF programs, conducted using probit regressions, provide further evidence of the degree to
which these programs were targeted towards the poor

and flood-exposed households (Table 4). The regressions clearly show that the criteria used for targeting
the households with respect to the level of flood exposure varied between the programs. Dummy variables
for flood exposure, and particularly dummy variables
for severe and very severe flood exposure, are highly
significant explanatory variables for the participation
in GR. In contrast, flood-exposure variables are not
statistically significant explanatory variables for the
participation in VGF, even in this sample of households from flood-affected thanas.
The coefficients of the variables that indicate the
level of household wealth confirm that the VGF program was better targeted towards the poorer households. Landlessness and housing characteristics (tin
roof and the number of buildings in the household
compound) are statistically significant explanatory
variables for participation in VGF. However, in the
GR regression among the household wealth variables,
only residing in a house with a tin roof reduces the
probability of participation.
Other household characteristics and household size
variables are not strong determinants of the probabil-

ity of receiving either GR or VGF transfers. In the
case of GR, this is to be expected, since the flood is
likely to have affected all the households in a village,
irrespective of household size. Nonetheless, there
appears to be a bias in the GR distribution towards
smaller families that have fewer younger children,
perhaps because these households were more mobile
and had less difficulty reaching the distribution centres. In the case of VGF transfers, targeting towards
larger families with more children might be expected.
However, few household composition variables are
significant, apart from those for the number of young
males, thus indicating that the overall level of wealth
(as reflected in the housing variables discussed above)
was the main determinant of participation in the
VGF program. Somewhat surprisingly, there is only
weak evidence of targeting towards female-headed
households. The coefficient on the dummy variable
for female household head is positive, but it is significantly different from 0 only at a 17% confidence
level.

4. Concluding observations
Food security at the household level depends both
on availability of food in markets and on access to
food. 9 Liberalisation of private sector imports of rice
and wheat in the early 1990s and ensuing government policies supporting the trade in 1998, enabled
private imports to stabilise market prices and supplies
during the 1998 flood in Bangladesh. Government
direct distribution programs, though small compared
to private imports, nonetheless increased the access
to food by poor households. Given the tight resource constraints that limit the size of distribution
programs, effective targeting is crucial. Immediate
relief efforts were well-targeted to flood-exposed
households, as were transfers from NGOs. VGF, a
medium-term program covered non-flood affected regions and, even in flood-affected thanas, was not targeted well to households directly exposed to the flood.
Nonetheless, according to survey data from the seven
flood-affected thanas, the program was relatively
well-targeted to poor households, with households in

the three lowest expenditure quintiles rece1vmg an
estimated 75% of the food grain distributed through
this program.
More broadly, the Bangladesh experience with the
1998 flood illustrates the dual role of food aid in
increasing the availability and providing resources
that enhance the access of food insecure households. In a liberalised trade regime, where private
imports respond to price signals, food aid's contribution to total availability of food may be minimal.
Nonetheless, foreign assistance in kind or in cash
can provide resources for subsidised, targeted distribution to food-insecure households - assistance not
otherwise possible under tight government budget
constraints.
