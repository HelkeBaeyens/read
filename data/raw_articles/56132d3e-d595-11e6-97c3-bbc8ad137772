Abstract
This paper provides quantitative evidence on the impact of the Training and Visit (T & V) extension system in the
irrigated Punjab of Pakistan. Three models are analyzed using limited dependent variable regressions: the impact of
T & V on the number of extension contacts with farmers; the effect of extension contact on farmers' knowledge of
wheat technology; and the impact ofT & V on the adoption of improved wheat technology. The first model analyzes
the impact of T & V on the quantity of extension contact and the latter two models analyze the effect on the quantity.
and quality of extension contact. It is concluded that T & V has increased the quantity but not the quality of
extension contact and this, in turn, has increased farmers' knowledge and adoption of technology. However, the
overall impacts have been small relative to those observed in a similar area in India.

Introduction
After a period in the 1960s and 1970s of declining interest in the role of extension in agricultural development, investment in extension systems increased dramatically in the 1980s. Much
of this increase was due to efforts by the World
Bank to revamp extension systems using the
Training and Visit System (T & V). The T & V
system designed by Benor and others (1984) advocated a more disciplined and focused approach

to extension through the following measures: (a)
removal of non-extension duties (e.g., supply of
inputs and collection of agricultural statistics) so
that village-level extension agents can focus on
information transfer; (b) increased extensionfarmer contact through a well-programmed
schedule of 2-weekly visits, often accompanied by
an increase in the ratio of extension workers to
farmers; (c) use of 'contact' farmers with close
links to extension and who are responsible for
passing extension messages to other farmers; (d)
increased training of village extension workers
through regularly conducted courses; and (e) close
links between extension and research to ensure
the relevance of extension messages to farmers'
needs.

Although the T & V system has been implemented in over 40 countries, including the major
countries of Asia and Africa, there has been
surprisingly little rigorous evaluation of its effectiveness. Some qualitative evaluations have questioned the approach ofT & V as being 'top down'
and lacking a means for organizing farmers to
express their own demands for extension advice
(e.g., Axinn, 1988; Roling, 1988). Others have
noted problems in implementation of T & V, especially the choice of contact farmers (Moore,
1984), poor research-extension links (Chapman,
1988; Goodell, 1983), and weak linkages with
farmers at the field level (Dejene, 1989). In other
cases, the information content of extension messages given to contact farmers is not disseminated
to neighboring farmers in the area (Luhe, 1991).
A few studies have made a somewhat more
quantitative assessment of the impacts of T & V,
noting improvement in the number of extension
contacts (e.g., Dejene, 1989) and, in some cases,
increases in technology adoption and yields (Due
et al., 1987). However, none of these studies has
attempted to isolate the effects of extension from
the effects of other factors that may influence
extension contact and adoption, 1 or even to compare changes in technology adoption or productivity with the situation that might have prevailed
in the absence of implementation of the T & V
system.
Only one study has made a rigorous quantitative analysis of the impacts of T & V extension by
comparing the degree of farmer-extension contact and farmers' knowledge and productivity in
two adjacent areas of northern India - one area
with 4 years of experience with the T & V system,
and one area using the traditional system of extension (Feder, Slade and Sundaram, 1986; Feder,
Lau and Slade, 1985; Feder and Slade, 1986;
henceforth collectively referred to as F &S). That
study concluded that the T & V system increased
extension contact and led to more rapid diffusion

1 In fact, the usual approach has been to relate extension
contact to adoption or yields, without considering the fact that
farmers with extension contacts are often not representative
farmers in terms of education, farm size, etc.

of knowledge in the area served by the T & V
extension approach relative to the adjoining nonT & V area. F & S estimated an increase of at least
7% in wheat productivity as a result of T & V
extension.
The objective of this paper is to provide further quantitative evidence of the impacts ofT & V
extension from the Punjab of Pakistan in an irrigated cropping system in the post-Green Revolution phase of development. The setting is quite
similar agroclimatically to the area studied by
F & S in northern India and the cropping system
also focusses on wheat. Also, as in northern India, the T & V extension approach was first introduced in the Pakistan Punjab in 1979. Early indications, however, suggest that T & V extension
was not successful in increasing farmer contact,
adoption rates or yields in the Pakistan Punjab
(Khan et al. 1984). Data for the analysis of this
paper provide a somewhat longer period for evaluation of the impacts of T & V.

2. Model and data sources
T & V extension may affect both the quantity
and quality of extension advice, which in turn
affect farmers' technical knowledge and skills to
directly increase productivity (through higher
technical efficiency in using existing inputs) or to
indirectly increase productivity (through changes
in input levels, i.e., higher allocative efficiency).
At the same time, the quantity and quality of
extension advice should not be seen as being
entirely exogenous; rather these variables may
themselves be a function of farmers' characteristics, especially education, farm size, infrastructure, etc., which determine demand for extension
advice. Analysis of all these possible influences
on productivity is a complex task. In this paper,
our data set enables an analysis of (a) determinants of the quantity of extension contact, (b)
determinants of farmers' technical knowledge,
and (c) determinants of the adoption of improved
technology being recommended by the extension
service. Unlike F & S we are unable to assess the
effects ofT & V on productivity, since the data set
employed was designed to measure the factors

S.S. Hussain et al. /Agricultural Economics 10 (1994) 39-47

influencing the diffusion of new wheat technologies. However, in the farming systems under study,
adoption of new technologies and practices being
recommended by the extension service is considered a necessary condition for increasing productivity (Hussain, 1989). 2
A further major issue in measuring the impact
of T & V is to identify what would have happened
in the absence of T & V. In this paper, we follow
the approach employed by F &S of choosing contiguous, relatively homogeneous areas in the same
agroclimatic zone, in which T & V extension has
been practiced only in part of the area. This is
facilitated in the Pakistan Punjab, since T & V
was introduced in only a few districts as a pilot
project. Hence we examine the two major cropping systems in the Punjab - rice-wheat and
cotton-wheat. In each system, we have a random
sample of about 50 farmers in one district where
T & V has been practiced for 6 years, and a random sample of about 100 farmers in adjacent
districts in the same cropping system in which
T & V has not been practiced. We recognize that
this method assumes that (a) the neighboring
districts are agroclimatically homogeneous, and
(b) the effects of T & V do not 'spill over' into
neighboring districts. With regard to the first
assumption, cropping system is a practical proxy
for agroclimatic zone; hence areas with similar
cropping systems should also be agroclimatically
similar. With regard to the second assumption,
we, like F &S, believe it is unlikely that significant
spillovers of extension information would occur
from one district to the next.
Overall we have a sample of 295 farmers, 101
of which are located in T & V districts. For each
farmer, detailed data were collected for the 1986
crop season on extension contact, knowledge of

2

It would also be desirable to assess the impacts of extension

for all major crops in the surveyed cropping systems. In the
surveyed area covered in this study, cotton, rice, maize and
sugar-cane are the other major crops. We have no reason to
expect the effects of extension on the other crops to be
greater than for wheat, especially since wheat is the major
winter crop and also a priority crop for research and extension, given its critical role in Pakistan's food security.

extension recommendations, technical knowledge
with respect to modern inputs (e.g., improved
varieties, fertilizers and herbicides), and farmers'
adoption of these practices. Except for extension
contact, all the data relate to knowledge and use
of technology for wheat, a major crop covering
90% of cropped area in the winter season and a
crop grown by all farmers in the sample. The
selection of wheat as the focus of this study also
enables comparisons with F & S, who analyzed
wheat technology and productivity as well.
From this data set we can specify several models that estimate the quantity and quality of extension advice and its impacts:
2.1. Quantity of extension contact
Eq. (1) models variables influencing extension
contact:
EXT= f(EDUC, AGE, FSIZE, ROAD, TANDY)

(1)

where EXT is a binary variable (0, 1) for extension
contact in the year preceding the survey, EDUC
the number of years of formal schooling, AGE
farmer's age (years), FSIZE farm size (ha), ROAD
dummy variable (0, 1) if village is on a sealed
road, and TANDY dummy variable (0, 1) for a
T & V district. This equation follows the standard
specification that larger and more educated farmers will gain higher benefits from improved information (Feder and Slade, 1986) and that supply
of extension advice will be easier or cost less for
farmers in accessible villages and for educated
farmers. We also hypothesize that extension contact is more widespread in T & V districts. This
equation then measures the effect of T & V on
the quantity of extension advice. Since EXT is a
binary variable, this equation is estimated as a
logit model.
2.2. Effect of extension contact on knowledge of
recommended technology
Eq. (2) models variables influencing farmers'
technical knowledge:
KNOWSCOR = f(EDUC, FSIZE, AGE, ROAD, RADIO,
TANDY,EXT,TANDY*EXT)

(2)

42

S.S. Hussain eta/./ Agricultural Economics 10 (1994) 39-47

where KNowscoR represents an index of farmers'
knowledge of new wheat technology (defined below), and RADIO is a dummy variable (0, 1) if the
farmer has listened to an extension-oriented program on the radio. This variable represents an
alternative information source: the same radio
extension program is available in both T & V and
non-T & V areas. Other variables are as defined
previously.
The extension variables EXT, TANDY and
TANDY* EXT were included in two specifications:
- TANDY included alone measures possible effects of T & V on both the quantity and quality
of extension advice for all farmers in T & V
districts relative to farmers in non-T & V districts.
- EXT and TANDY* EXT measure the effects of
the quantity and quality of extension advice,
respectively. TANDY* EXT tests whether farmers
in T & V areas who have extension contact
receive higher quality extension advice than
farmers in non-T & V districts.
Note that in this equation the dependent variable
lies in a bounded range (e.g., zero to a specific
number depending upon the maximum knowledge score); thus a two-tailed Tobit regression is
applied.
2.3. Adoption of recommended technology

Finally, Eq. (3) models variables influencing
technology adoption.
ADOPTi =f(EDUC, FSIZE, AGE, ROAD, RADIO,
TANDY,EXT,TANDY*EXT)
(3)
where ADOPTi is a variable measuring adoption/
non-adoption of improved practice i or the level
of improved practice i, and other variables are as
previously specified.
The analysis considers the adoption of three
practices widely promoted by extension - new
wheat varieties, use of phosphorus, and chemical
weed control. Although farmers in the study areas have had 15-20 years of experience with
modern wheat varieties introduced with the
Green Revolution, the disease resistance of these
varieties can break down over time, and research
and extension were promoting newer disease-resistant varieties released in the previous 5 years
to replace the older varieties. Likewise, farmers

have considerable experience with using nitrogenous fertilizers, but adoption of phosphatic fertilizers began only after about 1975. Most farmers
now use phosphatic fertilizers, and the analysis of
adoption provides evidence on the effects of extension in the later stages of adoption of a practice. Finally, weeds have become a major factor
limiting wheat yields, and both extension and the
private sector are promoting use of chemical weed
control. However, adoption of herbicides is in the
early stages, with only about 10% of surveyed
farmers using herbicides. Hence we analyze
adoption in three contrasting situations - replacement of an already adopted practice with a
newer practice (variety), the later stages of adoption of a new practice (phosphatic fertilizer), and
the early stages of adoption of a new practice
(herbicide).
To represent adoption of these practices,
ADOPT may be a binary variable (0, 1) (e.g., for
use of a new variety) in which case a logit model
is employed, or it may lie in a bounded range
(e.g., zero to any level of phosphorus use) in
which case a Tobit model is most appropriate.
The above specifications for Eqs. (1)-(3) imply
partially recursive models. Certain variables (e.g.,
EDUC and TANDY) are assumed to affect extension
contact (ExT), and EXT in combination with other
factors is assumed to affect farmers' knowledge
(KNowscoR) and adoption (ADOPT). The assumptions of Least Squares estimation are obviously
appropriate for Eq. (1). However, some specification bias might be expected by estimating Eqs. (2)
and (3) in the present form without any restrictions on the covariance matrix (Judge et al., 1982).
Thus the effect of extension on knowledge and
adoption might be underestimated.
3. Empirical results

Before presenting results of the estimated
models, it is worth noting some background information on the area analysed. The survey area
covering the major cropping systems of the Punjab is mainly irrigated by canal and is considered
to be one of the most productive regions of
Pakistan. Wheat is the major winter crop and is
grown under two cropping systems: rice-wheat

and cotton-wheat. Even after 6 years of T & V
extension, the amount of extension contact was
still low in the T & V districts. Only 43% and 24%
of farmers in the T & V districts in each cropping
system had had any contact with extension in the
year prior to the survey. By contrast, Feder, Slade
and Sundaram (1986) found 65% of farmers in
T & V areas of northern India had had contact
with extension in the month prior to the survey.
Likewise, the level of farmers' technical knowledge in the Pakistan Punjab is relatively low.
Only half of farmers in T & V districts had any
knowledge of new varieties or could distinguish
fertilizer nutrients; less than 7% could name a
recommended herbicide. Finally, only 41% and
9% of farmers in T & V districts had adopted
newer wheat varieties and herbicides, respectively. Most farmers (80%) had adopted phosphatic fertilizers but at less than half of the
recommended dose. These levels of knowledge
and adoption are considerably lower than comparable figures for India reported by F & S.
Regression results of the estimated models for
the quantity and quality of extension advice and
its impact are presented below. We initially ran
all regressions separately for each cropping sys-

tern. There were some differences in results between the two cropping systems, but the major
conclusions presented below hold for both cropping systems, which for simplicity of presentation
are combined in the following analysis.
Because there are no standard goodness of fit
tests for Logit, Probit and Tobit models, we compute chi-squared statistics to test the joint effects
of the independent variables. The chi-squared
values for most of the models are highly significant.

3.1. Quantity of extension contact
The logit regression results for factors affecting the quantity of extension contact are given in

where LNAGE and LNFSIZE are the logarithm of
AGE and FSIZE, respectively. 4
The results indicate that farmers' education
(Enuc) and farm size (LNFSIZE) had a positive and
highly significant effect on the quantity of extension contact. These results are consistent with the
F &S findings for the Indian Punjab that larger
and more educated farmers have better access to
improved information (e.g., extension). T & V extension also had a positive and statistically significant effect on the quantity of extension contact.
More regular visits and greater extension contacts
have also been reported under the T & V system
in Sri Lanka (Samarsingh et al., 1988). Other
variables such as ROAD had the expected positive
effect on the probability of extension contact, but
the effects were not significant.
3.2. Knowledge of recommended technology

Increased extension contact may not be very
useful unless it improves farmers' knowledge of
new technology leading to higher productivity.
Table 1 shows Tobit regression results for factors
affecting farmers' knowledge as measured by a
score of farmers' correct answers to a series of
questions on improved wheat technology (KNowscaR). A total of six knowledge variables were
linearly aggregated to form the knowledge score
variable. These included farmer's knowledge of
(1) names of new wheat varieties, (2) recommended doses of fertilizers, (3) fertilizer nutrient
composition, (4) fertilizer nutrient carry-over effects, (5) herbicide names and doses and (6) the
appropriate herbicides for different weed species.
Weights of 1 and 0 were given to correct and
incorrect answers to these six questions, respectively, and KNowscoR is then the total score with
a possible range from 0 (incorrect answers to all
questions) to 6 (correct answers for all questions).
Model 1 measures possible overall effects of
T & V and Model 2 measures the effect of both
quantity as well as quality of extension advice for
4 We have specified log transformations of the continuous
variables (e.g., FSIZE and AGE) in order to avoid the heteroscedasticity problem usually observed in linear models
(Maddala, 1983).

those farmers who have contact with extension.
T & V extension appeared to have no effect on
farmers' knowledge of new technology for farmers as a whole in T & V districts (column 1 of
Table 1). On the other hand, those farmers with
extension contact (ExT) had a significantly higher
knowledge score, even after allowing for their
better educational status (Model 2). The interaction of T & V with extension contact was statistically non-significant and negative, suggesting no
effect of T & V on quality of extension advice.
Other variables which have positive and statistically highly significant effects on farmers' knowledge score are Enuc (level of formal schooling)
and RADIO (farmer listens to an extension-oriented radio program). 5
We also sub-divided the variable for knowledge score, KNowscoR, into two components:
knowledge of recommendations (KNOWREc) and
general technical knowledge (KNOWTECH). The
KNOWREC variable represents the possible influence of extension in a communications role (e.g.,
whether the farmer knows the fertilizer dose recommended by the extension system), while the
KNOWTECH variable represents the effects of extension in an educational role (i.e., whether the
farmer understands the nutrient_ composition of
different commercial fertilizer products or the
possible carry-over effects of different fertilizer
nutrients from one season to the next). In both
cases, the KNOWREC and KNOWTECH variables have
a possible value range from 0 to 3. 6 It was
hypothesized that T & V extension has emphasized extension in a communications rather than
educational role (Byerlee, 1987). In fact, extension contact in Model 2 showed a positive and

5 RADIO might be influenced by EDUC and TANDY in which
case the models of Eqs. (2) and (3) may be mis-specified. Thus
regressions were run for both models with and without the
inclusion of the variable RADIO, but there was no significant
effect on the conclusions.
6 The KNOWREC variable was constructed from farmers' answers to questions about names of new varieties, fertilizer
recommendations, and types and doses of herbicides. The
KNOWTECH variable was based on questions regarding farmers'
knowledge of fertilizer nutrient composition, possible carryover effects of different nutrients, and knowledge of different
types of herbicides and their effects on different weed species.

statistically significant impact on farmers' technical knowledge (KNOWTECH) but had no significant
impact on farmers' knowledge of recommendations (KNOWREc). These results suggest that extension has more of an educational role. The fact
that the coefficients for TANDY * EXT were in
both cases negative adds support to the idea that
T & V has not improved the quality of extension
advice; rather the effects of T & V are the result
only of increased quantity of extension contact.
The most important factor in increasing farmers' knowledge (both knowledge of recommendations and technical knowledge) was the educational level of farmers. The coefficient for education (EDuc) is positive and statistically highly significant in all models, supporting evidence from
other studies that formal schooling plays an important role in increasing farmers' knowledge
about new agricultural technologies (Lockheed et
al., 1980).

3.3. Adoption of recommended technology
Finally, we examined factors affecting the
adoption of the three technological components
being promoted by extension. Results of the estimated Logit and Tobit models are presented in
Table 2. Overall extension contact (measured by
EXT) has a significant effect on adoption of chemical weed control, but not on use of new varieties
or phosphorus fertilizer. T & V extension may
have some effect on the overall adoption of
chemical weed control as shown by the positive
coefficient for TANDY in model 1 (significant at
the 10% level); in contrast the effects of T & V for
new varieties and phosphorus use tends to be
negative. Chemical weed control is the newest
technology and is still at an early stage of adoption, and this may explain the importance of
extension contact in the adoption of this technology. However, as in the case of the effects of

46

S.S. Hussain et al. /Agricultural Economics 10 (1994) 39-47

extension on knowledge score there is no evidence that the T & V system increases the quality
of extension advice.
Other important (statistically significant) variables affecting adoption are education, farm size
and age of the respondent. Education has a positive impact on adoption of improved varieties and
herbicides, again emphasizing the role of formal
schooling in using new technology. Also, farm
size has an overall positive impact on the adoption of new technology, especially new varieties,
possibly reflecting the greater ability of larger
farmers to experiment with new techniques. However, extension radio programs have no effect on
adoption, despite their apparent positive effect
on farmers' knowledge. As expected, none of
these variables influences adoption of phosphatic
fertilizer, which is in the late stage of adoption.

4. Why is T&V less effective in Pakistan?

The results suggest that although T & V extension has increased the quantity of extension advice, it has not been very effective relative to
traditional extension in increasing farmers' technical knowledge or the rate of adoption of new
technology - that is, the quality of extension
advice has not improved with introduction of
T & V. These results contrast with those of F & S
in a comparable area of India. We hypothesize
that there are two major reasons for the apparent
lack of impact of T & V on extension quality in
Pakistan. First, there were problems of implementing the T & V system as planned. For example, Khan et al. (1984) found that 20% of the
contact farmers in the T & V area did not even
recognize that they were in fact contact farmers
and hence the information flow of extension messages often stopped at the contact farmer. Also,
communication between research and extension
in the T & V target area is weak. The absence of a
research-extension coordinator may be one reason for this lack of systematic linkage, as noted in
other T & V projects (Dejene, 1989).
Second, because an effective adaptive research
program is lacking extension, messages are often
inappropriate to farmers' circumstances. Adap-

tive research in the area is usually targeted for
specific commodities and lacks a farming systems
perspective. Recommendations developed by
adaptive research are generally not locationspecific. Rather, they are made for a wide area
without taking into account the considerable variability in the socio-economic and agro-ecological
circumstances of farmers in what appears at first
to be a relatively homogeneous irrigated environment. For example, wheat yields are low in part
because of an increasing tendency to plant wheat
late in both the rice-wheat and cotton-wheat
cropping systems due to late harvesting of the
previous crop. Although it is economically rational to trade-off wheat yields in this way, recommendations for fertilizer use and irrigation are
made assuming that the crop is planted on time
(Byerlee, Akhter and Hobbs, 1987). Hence a much
stronger program of adaptive research implemented with a farming systems perspective and
closely linked to extension is needed in order to
develop more appropriate extension messages ..

5. Conclusions
Although the T & V extension system has been
widely promoted in many countries, it has been
subject to little rigorous evaluation. The results
presented in this paper for the Pakistan Punjab
indicate that T & V, after 7 years of experience,
had had less impact than expected on farmers'
technical knowledge or on adoption of improved
practices. The T & V system does seem to have
increased the quantity of extension contact, presumably because the ratio of extension agents to
farmers has been increased in the T & V districts
analyzed. Those farmers who have more extension contact do tend to have better technical
knowledge and have also adopted chemical weed
control earlier. However, T & V has not had any
effect on the quality of extension contact. Since a
major objective of the T & V system is to increase
the quality of extension advice and to make extension messages more widely known through the
contact-farmer approach, our results do not support the conclusions of Feder and Slade (1986) on

S.S. Hussain et al. /Agricultural Economics 10 (1994) 39-47

the positive effects of T & V in a similar irrigated
area in India. 7 In our experience, the limited
success of T & V in Pakistan reflects problems of
implementation (for example, a small proportion
of farmers had contact with extension, relative to
India), as well as lack of adaptive research to
make recommendations more relevant to farmers.
Despite the apparent lack of impact of T & V
extension observed in this study, the analysis does
provide interesting results on the effects of other
variables on farmers' extension contact, technical
knowledge and adoption. Education and farm
size are more important variables than T & V in
influencing extension contact, underlining the
well-known bias of extension toward bettereducated and wealthier farmers. Farmers' educational level, measured in terms of years of formal
schooling, also has a consistently large and significant effect on farmers' technical knowledge and
adoption. Radio programs also appear to be partly
effective as an extension device. Other variables
such as age and access to a good road do not
appear directly to affect farmers' technical knowledge and adoption, once differences in education
and extension contact have been taken into account. These results reinforce the importance of
investment in formal schooling in increasing productivity in post-Green Revolution agriculture
(Lockheed et al. 1980; Phillips, 1987).

However, a more complete evaluation in Pakistan would
require measuring differences in productivity through a production function approach; unfortunately a full specification
of the production function is not possible with the data at
hand.
