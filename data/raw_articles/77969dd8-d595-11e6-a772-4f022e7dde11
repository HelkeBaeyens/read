Abstract
This article develops a new cross-sectional methodology that explicitly incorporates adaptation into an analysis of the impacts of climate change.
The methodology examines how a farmer will change choices of species and number to adapt to climate. The approach is applied to study Africa,
where the impacts of climate change are expected to be the most severe. The results indicate that in warmer places, African farmers switch from
beef cattle to more heat-tolerant goats and sheep. In wetter places, farmers switch from cattle and sheep to goats and chickens. The results indicate
that large commercial livestock operations specializing in beef cattle will be hard hit from climate change whereas small farmers who can easily
substitute to goats and/or sheep will be more resilient.

1. Introduction
This article uses cross-sectional evidence to explore how
farmers adapt to exogenous environmental factors such as climate and soils. The model builds on the original insights of
the Ricardian model that explored the locus of land value
per hectare (Mendelsohn et al., 1994). Although the Ricardian
model captures adaptation in its measure of impacts, it does
not provide any insight into how farmers adapt. In this article, we develop a new approach, a Structural Ricardian Model,
that explicitly models the underlying endogenous decisions by
farmers. By comparing choices of farmers who face different
conditions, the model uncovers how farmers adapt. Conditional
incomes, using a Ricardian approach, are then estimated for
each choice made by each farmer.

We develop this new method and then apply it to study how
African farmers adapt livestock management to climate. We
explore which species they choose, how many animals they
own, and how net revenue per animal for each species changes.
Understanding adaptation is an important goal in itself to assist
planning by policy makers and private individuals. However,
understanding adaptation is also important if one is interested
in quantifying the impacts of climate change. Forecasts that
over- or underpredict adaptation will under- or overpredict the
residual damages from climate change.
Climate impact studies have consistently predicted extensive
impacts to the agricultural sector from climate change across
the globe (Pearce et al., 1996; McCarthy et al., 2001; Tol, 2002).
The bulk of agricultural studies on the effect of climate change
have focused on crops. However, a large fraction of agricultural
output is from livestock. In the United States, livestock account
for about 40% of the market value of agricultural products sold
(USDA, 2002). Almost 80% of African agricultural land is used
for grazing. Yet there are very few economic analyses of climatic effects on livestock. An important exception is the study
of the effects of climate change on American livestock (Adams
et al., 1999). American livestock appear not to be vulnerable
to climate change because most live in protected environments
(sheds, barns, etc.) and rely heavily on supplemental feed (e.g.,
hay and corn). African livestock have no protective structures
and they graze off the land. As a result, we anticipate that

African livestock will be sensitive to climate change. In a separate article, the Ricardian model is applied to African livestock
data (Seo et al., 2007) and shows that livestock are sensitive
to climate. In this article we provide insight into how farmers
adjust to climate and what they might do in the future.
The underlying theory of the Structural Ricardian Model is
developed in the next section. Section 3 discusses how data
were collected from over 5,000 farmers who own livestock in
10 countries across Africa for this study. Section 4 discusses
the estimation procedure and the cross-sectional empirical results. Forecasted impacts from three climate change scenarios
generated by Atmospheric Oceanic General Circulation Models (AOGCMs) are then examined in Section 5. The article
concludes with a summary of results and policy implications.
2. Theory
A farmer’s optimization decision can be seen as a simultaneous multiple-stage procedure. The farmer chooses the levels
of inputs, the desired number of animals, and the species that
will yield the highest net profit. Given the profit-maximizing
inputs from each farmer, one can estimate the loci of profitmaximizing choices for each species across exogenous environmental factors such as temperature or precipitation. These
are the individual loci that lie beneath the overall profit function
for the farm (Mendelsohn et al., 1994). We call the approach
a “cross-sectional adaptation model” because it estimates the
choice of a specific animal, the number of animals, and the underlying profit response functions per animal for each species

that form the overall profit function. For example, in Fig. 1
we display a traditional Ricardian response function with respect to temperature. Underneath the locus of all choices is a
set of species-specific response functions. Given the climate,
the farmer must choose the most profitable species and also the
inputs that will maximize the value of that species. We examine
the individual net revenue functions for each species as well as
the overall net revenue function across all species. We assume
that each farmer makes his animal husbandry decisions to maximize profit. 2 Hence, the probability that a species is chosen
depends on the profitability of that animal species (or crop if
one wants to examine the crop sector). We assume that farmer
i’s profit in choosing livestock j (j = 1, 2, . . . , J) is
πj i = V (Zj i ) + εj i ,

(1)

where Z is a vector of independent variables that includes climate variables, soils, and other socioeconomic variables such
as household characteristics. The profit function in Eq. (1) is
composed of two components: the observable component V and
an error term ε. The error term is unknown to the researcher, but
may be known to the farmer. The farmer will choose the livestock that gives him the highest profit. The farmer will choose
2 The theory of profit maximization can be contested especially in Africa (De
Janvry et al., 1991; Moll, 2005; Singh et al., 1986). We made the following two
adjustments to address the issues arising from special situations of African markets. First, we assume that if a farmer consumes his own product, it is valued at
market price. Second, most farms depend on their own labor. Although it might
be reasonable to value own labor by market wages, empirical examinations did
not support any specific wage.

More succinctly, farmer i’s problem is

Because the profit described in Eq. (1) is observed only for
the chosen species, one must correct for possible selection bias
when estimating the conditional net revenues or numbers of
animals (Heckman, 1979). Since the farmer maximizes net revenue conditional on the choice of that species, the error in the
second-stage equation may be correlated with the error in the
first stage. According to Dubin and McFadden (1984), with the
assumption of the following linearity condition 4 :
J

The probability Pj i for the jth livestock to be chosen is then

Pj i =

exp(Zj i γj )
J
k=1

exp(Zki γk )

,

(5)

which gives the probability that farmer i will choose livestock
j among J animals (Chow, 1983; McFadden, 1981).
The parameters can be estimated by the maximum likelihood method using an iterative nonlinear optimization technique such as the Newton–Raphson method. These estimates
are CAN (Consistent and Asymptotically Normal) under standard regularity conditions (McFadden, 1999).
Note that farmers can choose more than one species of livestock among the five species in our study. That is, there are many
combinations of livestock species that the farmer could choose.
In this analysis, we assume that farmers choose one primary
species from the five species. A primary species is defined as
that which generates the highest total net revenue for the farm
(Train, 2003). In another analysis of livestock choice, we compare this approach using the primary species with an alternative
portfolio approach that examines all possible choices including
combinations of species (Seo and Mendelsohn, 2007). The two
approaches yield similar results.
Conditional on the livestock species chosen, we estimate the
optimal number of animals per farm for each species and the
net revenue per animal for each species. We rely on a two-stage
model. In the first stage, we estimate the probability of selecting
a species (Eq. 5). In the second stage, conditional on the choice
of a specific species, we estimate the optimal number of that
species and the net revenue per animal. We identify the species
choice equations using the relative prices of each choice. We
identify the number of animal equations using the percentage
of grassland in the district. Note that this more general variable
was used instead of grassland on the farm because many African
livestock owners graze animals on common lands.

Two common assumptions about the error term are either the Normal or
the Gumbel distribution. Normal random variables have the property that any
linear combination of normal varieties is normal. The difference between two
Gumbel random variables has a logistic distribution, which is similar to the
normal but with larger tails. Thus the choice is somewhat arbitrary with large
samples (Greene, 1998).

where uj is the error from the profit equation in the second
stage, εj is the error from the choice equation in the first stage,
σ is the standard error of the profit equation, and rj the correlation between the profit equation and choice equations, then
the selection bias-corrected conditional profit functions can be
consistently estimated as

where the second term on the right-hand side is the selection

include climate variables, soils, and socioeconomic variables;
ϕ j is a vector of parameters; and wj is the error term.
The optimal number of animals can be estimated in the same
manner:

where the various terms are defined similarly as in Eq. (7a).
The two-stage model is composed of Eq. (5) and equations
(7a) and (7b). Expected net revenue is therefore
J

Wi (Zi ) =

Pj (Zj i ) · πj (Zj i ) · Nj (Zj i ).

(8)

j =1

Because climate is an independent variable in all three terms
in Eq. (8), the marginal effect on welfare of a change in a
climate variable, say Zc , has three components: the effect on the
probability of the livestock to be chosen, the direct effect on the
conditional profit per animal, and the effect on the conditional
number of animals:

4 See Bourguignon et al. (2004) for the details of the selection bias corrections from the multinomial choice. They find that in most cases, Dubin and
McFadden’s method is preferable to the most commonly used Lee method,
as well as to Dhal’s semiparametric method. Monte Carlo experiments show
that selection bias correction based on the multinomial logit model can provide
fairly good correction for the outcome equation even when the IIA hypothesis
is violated.

where the marginal effect on the probability can be obtained by
differentiating Eq. (5):

and the marginal effect on the net revenue per animal, assuming
a quadratic relationship between the net revenue and the corresponding climate variable, can be obtained by differentiating
Eq. (7a):
∂πj
= ϕj 1 + 2 · ϕj 2 · zc ,
∂zc

(11)

and the marginal effect on the number of animals per farm,
also assuming a quadratic relationship between the number of
animals and the relevant climate variable, can be found by
differentiating Eq. (7b):
∂Nj
= η j 1 + 2 · η j 2 · zc ,
∂zc

(12)

where the subscripts 1 and 2 in equations (11) and (12) denote
the estimated parameters for the linear term and the quadratic
term for the climate variable zc .
The change in welfare resulting from a nonmarginal change
in climate can be computed as the difference in the expected
net revenues in the two states before and after climate change.
Suppose that climate changes from Cbefore to Cafter . Then the
change in welfare can be approximated as
Wi = Wi (Cafter ) − Wi (Cbefore ).

(13)

The uncertainty surrounding our measure of the welfare
change can be described by the 95% confidence interval of
the expected climate change impact. In principle, there are two
ways to calculate confidence intervals: parametric and nonparametric. It is difficult to calculate the variance of the climate
change impact parametrically in this model because welfare is
the product of three predictions. We provide uncertainty estimates in this study via a bootstrap method by resampling 200
times from the original sample and calculating the 95% confidence interval using the mean and the standard deviation of
the resulting climate change impacts (Andrews and Buchinsky,
2000).
3. Data
Data for this study come from a larger Global Environmental Facility (GEF)–World Bank project to study climate change
impacts on agriculture in Africa (Dinar et al., 2008). The countries included were Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Egypt, Ethiopia,
Ghana, Kenya, Niger, Senegal, South Africa, and Zambia. (Zimbabwe had to be dropped from the livestock analysis because
of turbulent conditions in that country during the survey.) The

countries were selected to represent the wide range of climate
throughout Africa. Districts within each country were selected
to provide as much within-country climate variation as possible.
Because existing economic data were not sufficient to support
an analysis, an economic survey of farmers was conducted. The
original survey interviewed more than 9,000 farmers from 11
countries. Within that sample, more than 5,000 were livestock
farmers (Kurukulasuriya et al., 2006).
The livestock data include information on species, the stock
of livestock owned, and the livestock products and animals
sold during the period of July 2002 to June 2003 (the data
from Kenya, Ethiopia, and Cameroon cover the period July
2003 to June 2004). The data identify the five major types of
livestock in Africa as beef cattle, dairy cattle, goats, sheep,
and chickens. Other less frequently recorded animals include
pigs, breeding bulls, oxen, camels, ducks, guinea fowl, horses,
bees, and doves. The major livestock products sold were milk,
meat, eggs, wool, and leather. Other products included butter,
cheese, honey, skins, and manure. The five major livestock
accounted for 93% of the total net livestock revenue in the
sample (Seo and Mendelsohn, 2007).
All countries in the sample had a large number of livestock
farms. Most of the farms in our survey were small household
farms, but a majority of the farms in South Africa and Kenya located in temperate climate zones were large commercial farms.
Definitions of what constitutes a small household farm versus
a large commercial farm are country-specific. South Africa had
a large number of commercial beef cattle farms while Kenyan
farmers kept dairy cattle and beef cattle in large numbers. Farmers in Egypt tended to raise chickens while West African farmers depended more on goats and sheep (Seo and Mendelsohn,
2007).
Climate data come from two sources: U.S. Defense Department satellites and weather station observations. We relied on
satellite temperature observations and interpolated precipitation observations from ground stations (see Mendelsohn et al.
[2007] for a detailed explanation). The climate data measures
the long-run average weather (17 to 30 years), not the weather
in the particular year of the economic survey. Climate data
were gathered in monthly measures of temperature (◦ C) and
precipitation (mm/month) and then aggregated by season: Winter (May, June, July), Spring (August, September, October),
Summer (November, December, January), and Fall (February,
March, April). Seasons for locations north of the equator were
defined in reverse. Soil data were obtained from the FAO digital soil map of the world (Food and Agriculture Organization
[FAO] 2004). Soil data were extrapolated to the district level
using GIS. The data set reports 116 dominant soil types and 26
aggregated soil types.

4. Empirical results
As indicated above, although there are many livestock
species in Africa, we focus on the five primary species that

Notes: (1) The base case is chickens.
(2) The critical value of chi-square statistic for the significance at 5% is 3.7.

generated the most livestock income: beef cattle, dairy cattle, goats, sheep, and chickens. 5 We model the probability of
choosing each species as a function of summer and winter temperature and summer and winter precipitation. We also include
other explanatory variables such as dominant soils and a dummy
variable for electricity. We identified the selection equations by
the input and output prices of the five species. For example, the
higher the price of milk (one of the primary outputs) the more
likely farmers are to choose dairy cattle and goats, but the less
likely they are to choose sheep and beef cattle.
Table 1 shows the results of the multinomial logit regression
of the probability of choosing each of the five species. The base
case is a household that chose chickens. Most of the coefficient
estimates are significantly different from zero. The three tests
of the global significance of the model—likelihood ratio test,
Lagrange multiplier test, and Wald test—verify that the model
is highly significant. The coefficients report the odds ratio. For
example, the odds ratio of the electricity dummy for beef cattle
is 2.6, which implies that farms with electricity are 2.6 times
(odds ratio) more likely to own beef cattle than farms without
electricity. Farms with electricity are also more likely to choose
sheep but less likely to choose dairy cattle and goats. Soil variables are weakly significant and their coefficients vary across
livestock species. For example, dairy cattle are more likely to
be chosen under Cambisol soils, but not under Gleysol soils.
Under Gleysol soils, beef cattle are more likely to be selected,
compared with other species.
5

Species can be further differentiated by breeds (Oklahoma State University,
2007). For example, some breeds of beef cattle and sheep are more heat tolerant
than others. Information about breeds was not collected in the survey and so
this study does not distinguish between different breeds within species.

Coefficients for livestock prices are significantly different
from zero in most cases. As the price of milk, the primary output from dairy cattle and goats, rises, more farmers choose dairy
cattle and goats. Own animal price was difficult to interpret because it is both the price of buying an animal (input price) and
the price of selling it (output price). In general, higher own
prices led farmers away from choosing a species. For example,
higher beef cattle prices discouraged farmers from selecting
beef cattle. Cross price effects are also evident in Table 1. Negative cross price terms imply that two animals are incompatible
whereas positive cross price terms imply that they can be raised
jointly. For example, the coefficient on the price of goats (chickens) is positive (negative) for beef and dairy cattle but negative
(positive) for sheep, implying that goats (chickens) can be raised
with cattle (sheep) but not sheep (cattle).
Most climate variables are significantly different from zero.
The quadratic summer temperature coefficients are positive for
goats, sheep, and dairy cattle implying a U-shaped function
but the temperature response function for beef cattle is hillshaped. The quadratic coefficients of the precipitation variables
are generally positive, indicating a U shape except for beef cattle
and dairy cattle responses to winter precipitation. Although
not shown in Table 1, we also tested for the effects of other
important control variables such as water availability, altitude,
and other social factors such as religion. These variables were
dropped because they were not significant. We also tested a
number of variables describing the farmer including gender,
age, and education but these too were not significant and so
were dropped.
Fig. 2a graphs the relationship between the probability of
choosing a species and annual temperature. Note that the mean
temperature in sub-Saharan Africa is 22◦ C. The probability of

S. N. Seo, R. Mendelsohn / Agricultural Economics 38 (2008) 151–165

156

choosing beef cattle and dairy cattle decreases rapidly as temperature rises. In contrast, the probability of choosing goats and
sheep climbs as temperature rises. With chickens, the estimated
probability is hill-shaped, with a maximum at the current mean
temperature of Africa. The graph clearly reveals that farmers
in Africa today choose animal species selectively to make the
best use of the current temperature.
Fig. 2b displays the estimated relationship between the probability of choosing a species and annual precipitation. The
probability of choosing beef cattle, dairy cattle, and sheep all
decreases as precipitation increases. Greater rainfall increases
the probability of diseases such as Trypanosomiasis (Nagana),
Theileriasis (East Coast Fever), and Rift Valley Fever (Ford
and Katondo 1977; University of Georgia, 2007) and, perhaps
more importantly, in the long term, shifts the ecosystem from
savanna to forest (Sankaran et al., 2005). All three of the large
grazing animals are clearly more productive in grasslands. In
contrast to the above results, goats and especially chickens are
more likely as rainfall increases. Goats may be relatively better
able to forage successfully in forest settings.
In the second stage of the analysis, we estimate the conditional net revenue functions. The net revenue per animal for
each chosen species is regressed on climate variables, soil variables, a dummy variable for electricity, and sale price of the
corresponding livestock. We identify these net revenue regressions by the sale prices. We account for selection bias by using
the Dubin–McFadden selection bias correction terms. These
conditional net revenue regressions use the same seasonal climate variables used in the choice regressions. The functional
form is quadratic in both temperature and precipitation.

Table 2 summarizes the results of the regression of the conditional net revenue per animal. These regressions confirm that
the conditional net incomes from the five livestock are sensitive to climate. For beef cattle and chickens, the linear terms
for summer temperature are positive and quadratic terms are
negative, implying a hill-shaped response function. For goats
and dairy cattle, the response functions are U-shaped, but the
coefficients of the second-order terms are not significant. Summer precipitation response functions for all the species are Ushaped. Some soil variables are significant. Gleysol soils are
especially harmful to dairy cattle, but beneficial to sheep. The
price of dairy cattle, goats, chickens, and sheep have a positive
own price elasticity while the own price elasticity of beef cattle
is insignificant.
The selection bias coefficients reveal interactions among the
species. If the coefficients are negative (positive), they suggest
that conditions which make the farm attractive to one species
would make it less (more) attractive to the other. For example, in
the beef cattle income regression, the coefficient on the selection
term for sheep is positive, but the selection term for chickens
is negative. The results reveal that farmers who the selection
model predicted would choose sheep (but who actually chose
beef cattle) have higher than expected beef incomes. Whereas
if the selection model predicted the farmer would have chosen
chickens but the farmer actually chose beef cattle, that farmer
would have lower beef cattle income.
Because the seasonal and quadratic terms make the climate
variables difficult to interpret, we present the estimated climate
response functions in Fig. 3. Fig. 3a shows how conditional net
income per animal responds to temperature for each of the five

species. The conditional net income per animal is generally
higher for beef cattle but it decreases rapidly as temperature
rises until the temperature reaches the African mean temperature, at which point farmers stop choosing beef cattle (see
Fig. 2a). Commercial beef cattle are very profitable but they
are largely restricted to temperate zones in Africa. By contrast, dairy cattle net revenue increases with higher temperature. Dairy cattle operations are currently concentrated in the
temperate zones in East Africa and Southern Africa, but they
are more widely spread across the continent than beef cattle.
The conditional net income per animal for goats, sheep, and
chickens changes with temperature, but the magnitude of the
change is relatively small compared to cattle. Ceteris paribus,
compared to beef cattle, these smaller animals—goats, sheep,
and chickens—are likely to become relatively more attractive
to African farmers as temperatures rise. The figure also indicates that dairy cattle might substitute for beef cattle in higher
temperatures.
Fig. 3b shows how conditional net revenue responds to precipitation. It is important in interpreting these results to recognize that increases in precipitation in Africa imply that land
shifts from grassland to forest (not from unproductive to more
productive pastureland). The conditional net revenue of beef
cattle decreases precipitously the wetter it gets, whereas dairy
cattle net revenues remain quite stable over a large range of precipitation. Sheep conditional net revenue also decreases with
precipitation. The conditional net revenues of goats and chickens increase slightly.
We also estimate a third set of regressions that predict the
number of animals chosen of each species. We identify this third
set of regressions by the percentage of grassland in each district.

159

Districts with more natural grassland can support more animals.
As reported in Table 3, farms in districts with more grassland
choose to own more beef cattle, dairy cattle, goats, and sheep per
household. Farms with electricity own more animals in general
but fewer sheep. Soil variables are mostly insignificant, except
for the positive correlation between Gleysol soils and number
of sheep. Some of the selection bias correction terms are also
significant.
The number of each species of livestock is defined to be a
quadratic function of summer and winter temperature and precipitation as in the two previous regressions. For each animal,
some of the climate variables are significant determinants of the
number of that species. Summer temperature is significant for
dairy cattle, chickens, and sheep, while winter temperature is
significant for goats and sheep. The number of goats and sheep
has a U-shaped relationship with winter temperature. Summer
precipitation is significant for beef cattle, chickens, and sheep.
The response is U shaped for chickens, but hill shaped for beef
cattle and sheep.
In Figs. 4a and b, we present how the estimated numbers of
livestock change in response to temperature and precipitation.
Fig. 4a shows that the number of beef cattle decreases sharply as
temperature increases while that of dairy cattle shows a slight
decrease. There are slight increases in the numbers of goats
and sheep. Chickens have a U-shaped response function with
respect to both temperature and precipitation, but we omit them
from both figures because they are at an incompatible scale.
Fig. 4b shows that the numbers of dairy cattle and goats are
quite stable over a large range of precipitation, but the number
of beef cattle decreases rapidly with more rainfall. The sheep
increase in number as rainfall increases, despite the fact that

net revenue declines.
Table 4 shows how all three decisions would change with
a marginal change in climate. As can be seen from the top
panel, as temperature rises, farmers switch away from beef

cattle, dairy cattle, and chickens and toward goats and sheep.
These changes are supported in the second panel of the table
by the decrease in income from beef cattle in comparison to
the increase in income for sheep and relatively small change in
income for goats. Farmers accordingly reduce the number of

increase the number of goats and sheep. As rainfall increases,
farmers move away from beef cattle, dairy cattle, and sheep
toward goats and chickens. With the increase in rainfall, the
net income of beef cattle, dairy cattle, and sheep declines, but
the net income of goats and chickens increases. Although not
completely consistent across the three analyses, the table clearly
indicates that farmers would substitute beef cattle for goats and
sheep as temperature rises and they would substitute cattle and
sheep for goats and chickens as rainfall increases.
5. Climate simulations
We now simulate the consequences of climate change using
the parameter estimates from the previous section. We examine a set of climate change scenarios predicted by Atmospheric
Oceanic General Circulation Models (AOGCMs). The climate
scenarios reflect the A2 SRES scenarios from the following
three models: the Canadian Climate Center (CCC) scenario
(Boer et al., 2000), Center for Climate System Research (CCSR)
(Emori et al., 1999), and Parallel Climate Model (PCM) (Washington et al., 2003). The models were selected to provide a range
of climate scenarios from mild (PCM) to severe (CCC). For each
model, we examine country-level climate change scenarios in
2020, 2060, and 2100. For each climate scenario, we added

the change in temperature predicted by each climate model to
the baseline temperature in each district. We also multiplied the
percentage change in precipitation predicted by each climate
model by the baseline precipitation in each district or province.
This gave us a new climate for every district in Africa for each
model and each time period.
Table 5 summarizes the climate scenarios of the three models for the years 2020, 2060, and 2100. The models predict a
broad set of scenarios consistent with the range of outcomes
in the most recent IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change) report (Houghton et al., 2001; IPCC, 2007). In 2100,
PCM predicts a 2◦ C increase, CCSR predicts a 4◦ C increase, and
CCC predicts a 6◦ C increase in temperature in Africa. Rainfall
predictions are noisier: PCM predicts an average 10% increase,
CCC predicts a 10% decrease, while CCSR predicts a 30% average decrease of rainfall in Africa. In addition to the mean rainfall in Africa varying substantially across the scenarios, there is
also substantial variation in rainfall across countries within each
scenario.
The three climate models predict temperatures to increase
steadily until 2100 although at different rates. Precipitation predictions, however, vary across time: CCC predicts a declining
trend; CCSR predicts an initial decrease, and then increase,
and decrease again; PCM predicts an initial increase, and then
decrease, and increase again.
We used the parameters from our estimated models in the
previous section to simulate the impacts of climate change on
the expected revenue of livestock management under various
scenarios. Table 6 shows the changes in the probabilities of
choosing a particular species for each climate scenario. CCC
scenario predicts farmers to shift away from beef cattle, dairy
cattle, and chickens to goats and sheep by 2020. Under the wet
PCM scenario, sheep ownership also declines. Under the dry
CCSR scenario, beef cattle are chosen less often, but to a lesser
degree. These results are consistent with our earlier response

functions of species choices in Figs. 2a and b. This general
trend also continues until 2100.
We show the changes in the conditional net incomes per animal in Table 7. By 2100, the net income from beef cattle will

decrease over the next century by 30% with the PCM scenario,
by 10% according to the CCSR scenario, but increase by 50%
according to the CCC scenario. Net incomes for dairy cattle
increase by 30–50% by the year 2100. Net incomes for sheep
increase with the CCC and CCSR scenarios, but decrease with
the PCM scenario. On the contrary, net incomes for goats increase according to CCSR and PCM scenarios, but decrease
with the CCC scenario. Net incomes for chickens increase especially under the wet PCM scenario in 2100.
Table 8 calculates the changes in the number of animals of
each species for each climate scenario. These results are consistent with the previous two tables on probabilities and net
incomes indicating that beef cattle will decline substantially
while goats, sheep, and chickens will increase over the coming
century. Across the models, the number of beef cattle is predicted to decrease by an average of 15 per farm in 2020, 20 per
farm in 2060, and 33 per farm in 2100. The number of dairy
cattle is predicted to remain quite stable over the next 100 years.
Goats increase in number by 4 in 2020, by 7 in 2060, and by 13
on average in 2100. The numbers of sheep and chickens also
are expected to increase.
Combining the results from Tables 6, 7, and 8, the expected
change in net income is shown in Table 9 for each AOGCM
scenario. The current average income from livestock management is around $900. For all the scenarios, the expected income
from livestock farms is expected to drop substantially by 2020,
by between 15 and 20%. In the CCC scenario, the loss from
livestock sector declines to 10% by 2060 and turns into a large
gain by 2100. With the CCSR scenario, the damages increase
to 25% in 2060 with more precipitation but then shrink again
by 2100. With the PCM scenario, there is a 15% loss of income
by 2020, but this loss is offset completely by 2060, and turns
into a gain by 2100.
African farmers are expected to lose income initially because
they must switch away from beef cattle to animals that provide
lower returns (thus lowering the net income per animal) and
reducing the number of valuable animals. These net results
are consistent with the traditional Ricardian analysis of the

same data (Seo et al., 2007). However, farmers will be able
to substitute species, reducing this initial damage over time.
The 95% confidence interval was calculated for all of these
estimates using 200 bootstrap runs. The estimated damages
are significantly different from zero for most of the AOGCM
scenarios in 2020, 2060, and 2100 except for the PCM scenarios
in 2060 and 2100.
Table 9 also extends the analysis from the sample to all farms
in Africa. This leads to an estimate of the aggregate livestock
impact across Africa. The results suggest that the damage will
vary from a loss of $9 to $12 billion in livestock income in
2020, from zero to a $15 billion loss in 2060, and finally from
a loss of $5 billion to a gain of $100 billion in 2100. In the long
run, climate change will be beneficial to the livestock sector in
Africa and this will offset some of the expected losses to crops
(Kurukulasuriya et al., 2006).

6. Conclusion
This article uses a structural equation model to capture the
endogenous choices made by farmers and their resulting expected income. The model assumes that farmers choose the
profit-maximizing level of inputs for each animal, the species
that provides the highest net revenue, and the number of animals of that species. The article tests whether these decisions
are influenced by climate. The resulting model gives insights
into how farmers might adapt to climate change.
The model is applied to 5,000 livestock farmers in Africa.
The multinomial choice model reveals that the probability of
selecting beef cattle, dairy cattle, and chickens diminish sharply
in warmer places. This is completely consistent with the observation that commercial cattle operations are currently located
only in temperate locations across Africa, such as South Africa
and Kenya. Furthermore, the model predicts that numbers of
goats and sheep will increase with warming. This again is consistent with observations of where goats and sheep are currently
located, in relatively hot locations such as Burkina Faso, Niger,
and Senegal. The model also reveals that beef cattle and sheep
are more common in dryer areas, whereas goats and chickens
are more common in wetter locations.
The conditional net revenue analysis supports the multinomial choice results in general. Net revenue of beef cattle is
lower in warmer places, but net revenue of sheep is higher
in warmer places. In a wetter place, net revenue from goats
and chickens is higher, but sheep net revenue is lower. Consequently, farmers move away from beef cattle to goats and
sheep in warmer places. Farmers shift from cattle and sheep
to goats and chickens in wetter places and the reverse in dryer
places.
Finally, the predicted number of animals of each species
is also consistent with the results from the multinomial logit
choice and conditional net revenue analysis. The number of
beef cattle declines rapidly with warming while the number of
dairy cattle changes little. By contrast, the number of goats,

163

sheep, and chickens increases. With a precipitation increase
(decrease), the number of beef cattle declines (increase) while
the number of chickens increases (falls). As the net profitability
of livestock falls, farmers will reduce their investments in that
livestock and reduce their herds. This is especially evident with
beef cattle and warmer temperatures.
There has been very little quantitative research on animal
husbandry in Africa so there are few empirical studies with
which to compare these results. A standard Ricardian analysis
was done by Seo et al. (2007), using the same data. The results
of the standard Ricardian model are not exactly the same but are
consistent with the results in this article. That is, the Ricardian
analysis predicted that net revenues of large commercial farms
will fall with either rising temperature or rising rainfall levels,
but those of small household farms will increase with warming
due to their reliance on goats and sheep.
All the AOGCM predictions suggest that the expected profit
from African livestock management will fall as early as 2020.
Most of this effect is from the falling profitability of large beef
cattle operations. Even small changes in temperature will be
sufficient to have a relatively large effect on beef cattle operations. Additional warming will still be harmful, but farmers
will be able to make necessary substitutions to avoid further
damages, thereby lessening the magnitude of damage. Large
farms dependent on beef cattle will be especially hard hit. In
contrast, small farms that switch to sheep or goats may not be as
vulnerable to higher temperatures compared with large farms
that cannot make this switch.
Precipitation also plays an important role in the AOGCM results. Scenarios with more precipitation, for example the CCSR
2060 scenario, are more harmful. Because pastures and ecosystems in general are more productive with more rain, this result
may seem counterintuitive. However, in Africa, increased precipitation may increase animal diseases such as Nagana, East
Coast Fever, and Rift Valley Fever that are quite significant
for livestock (Ford and Katondo 1977; University of Georgia, 2007). Perhaps more importantly, more rain shifts savanna
or grasslands into forest ecosystems (Sankaran et al., 2005).
These grasslands are more productive for sheep, dairy cattle,
and beef cattle. Reductions in precipitation from large to moderate levels appear to be beneficial to livestock. As long as there
is sufficient precipitation to support grasslands, livestock will
gain.
This analysis reveals one way that farmers will be able to
adapt to climate change. It suggests that small farmers will
switch species and move away from beef cattle, dairy cattle,
and chickens toward goats and sheep. Small farmers will be
able to make these changes without much change in expected
income. However, climate change is predicted to reduce the
net incomes of large farms considerably. African policy makers must be careful to encourage private adaptation during this
period of change. There may be nothing that can be done to sustain the large cattle operations that depend on current climate.
Providing subsidies or other enticements for such operations
to continue once climate changes occur would only compound

164

the situation. Instead, governments should encourage farmers
to change the composition of animals on their farms as needed.
That is, they should inform farmers about how other livestock
owners have coped with higher temperatures and share indigenous knowledge. Governments should anticipate that farmers
will make changes on their lands and do whatever is needed to
facilitate these changes.
In interpreting these results, there are several caveats that
should be kept in mind. First, this analysis does not include the
effect of global warming on prices. We assumed global market prices of livestock are relatively stable over the century. If
instead there are large changes in livestock prices, these results
will overestimate the welfare effects of climate change. Second,
we assumed adaptations can take place as needed. For example, farmers can switch across types of livestock as temperature
increases and rainfall decreases. However, this may not be the
case if the adjustment requires a heavy capital investment or
substantial learning. Third, we assumed that in forecasting climate change impacts, the only thing that changes in the future is
climate. Many things, however, will change over the century, including population, technologies, institutional conditions, and

reliance on agriculture and livestock. Fourth, we assumed that
ecosystems will change quickly as climate changes. This may
not be the case as many forest ecosystems that will eventually
shift to another ecosystem may survive well into the future.
Fifth, the analysis did not examine climate variation or extreme
events. Although it is not clear whether climate variance will
change in the future (IPCC, 2007), any change in climate variance is likely to have a profound effect on African livestock.
Lastly, the survey collected only limited data on the cost of
raising livestock. The study did not have a complete account
of all the costs of raising livestock. Future studies should address these issues to provide more accurate measures of climate
change impacts.
The overall conclusions of the analysis suggest that there
will be damages from global warming to African livestock
in the next 20 years of between $9 and $12 billion. Damages in midcentury will depend on precipitation patterns. In
the long run, global warming will likely be beneficial to the
livestock sector in Africa and this will help offset some of
the expected losses to African crops (Kurukulasuriya et al.,
2006).
