Abstract
This study examines the need for crop insurance for litchi production in northern Vietnam and how farmers might participate
in such a program. Hypothetical insurance programs were developed which proposed all-risk coverage based on area yields.
This coverage was offered to farmers to determine both their interest in the program and how insurance features and farmer
characteristics affected their decision to buy insurance. Farmers were also surveyed regarding their production practices,
price and yield expectations, and financial and personal characteristics. Even before considering other program costs and
government budget constraints, there is not a strong case for establishing a crop insurance program here. Results indicate
that while farmer participation would be significant, crop insurance is not needed to achieve policy goals like raising farmer
income or guaranteeing subsistence levels of income. Crop insurance is not needed to promote litchi production, which is
already expanding rapidly due to its high profitability relative to other farm enterprises. In their choice of coverages, farmers
preferred higher yield guarantee levels and lower indemnity prices. Estimated premiums were quite low when expressed as
a percent of expected revenue, and farmers were not responsive to changes in premiums. Econometric analysis indicated
that high income farmers were more likely to participate, but other farmer characteristics seemed to matter little. Anecdotal
evidence suggested that farmers believed the expected area yields used to set insurance coverage levels were too low. Because
litchi productivity varies significantly by tree age and the litchi planted area is expanding rapidly, determining appropriate
values for expected area yields and insurance coverage levels appeared to be the biggest challenge in program design. It is
hypothesized that additional farmer education about the relationship between area and farm yields and other aspects of area
insurance could improve such a program's operation. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

1. Introduction
Crop insurance has been used in a variety of
forms and for a variety of purposes in more than 70
countries, according to an FAO survey published in
199l(FAO, 1991). In particular, developing countries
have established crop insurance programs not only to
provide farmers with another risk management tool

but also to promote other goals, such as improving
farmers' access to credit, promoting production of
high-value crops that might also have higher yield
risk, and providing more stability to agriculture and
related industries. There have been quite varying degrees of success over the years, across countries and
across several types of insurance programs (see Hazell
et al., 1986; Hueth and Furtan, 1994; Mishra, 1996).
At this date, Vietnam has no formal agricultural insurance programs. As part of a pedagogical program
related to risk analysis in agricultural production with

174

the Faculty of Economics and Rural Development at
Hanoi Agricultural University #1, a study was undertaken to evaluate farmers' interest in crop insurance
for a crop in northern Vietnam. Several questions were
important at the outset: could crop insurance be used
to promote production of high-value, non-traditional
crops; what types of insurance coverage would be
appropriate for the particular conditions of northern
Vietnam; would farmers' incomes be significantly stabilized by crop insurance; would farmers voluntarily
participate in the program; and what factors appeared
to affect farmers' insurance decisions.
Litchi (Litchi chinensis) was considered an appropriate crop for study because it appeared to be highly
profitable, yet it could be considered a non-traditional
crop that has not been widely adopted. In addition, the
view commonly held among farmers was that litchi
production was rather uncertain. The primary litchi
growing area in northern Vietnam is near Hanoi, and
local officials in one district there were willing to cooperate with surveys of litchi producers.
Two surveys were conducted to collect information addressing the issues mentioned above. A survey
in May 1998 looked at farmers' production practices, costs, and expectations for prices and yields
for all crop and livestock enterprises, along with
farmers' personal characteristics such as age, education, and family size, and financial characteristics
such as non-farm income and credit availability. A
second survey in September 1998 evaluated farmers'
responses to hypothetical crop insurance contracts on
litchi production.
The following sections describe general conditions
for litchi production and other farming practices in the
surveyed area, the design of a hypothetical insurance
program for litchi, farmer responses to this proposed
coverage, and an econometric model of insurance demand. The final section summarizes the need for crop
insurance for litchi production in northern Vietnam
and some observations about insurance program design.

2. Litchi production in northern Vietnam
Litchi production in northern Vietnam occurs primarily in the mountainous region bordering the northern edge of the Red River delta. Luc Ngan district in

Bac Giang province, located about 80 km northeast of
Hanoi, was selected for the study, since it is an important center for litchi production in this area.
Luc Ngan district has about 1012km2 and is home
to 173,000 people living in 31,100 households. Luc
Ngan district's labor force works primarily in agriculture. Ethnic Vietnamese comprise about 54% of the
local population, while 10 other ethnic groups living
in the more mountainous areas of the district comprise
the rest. Litchi production occurs mainly among the
Vietnamese ethnic group.
The climate and topography of Luc Ngan district
are well-suited for production of a tree crop like litchi.
Annual rainfall is about 1800--2000mm per year, average annual temperature is 18-23Â°C, and Luc Ngan
is seldom affected by severe storms. Only about 18%
of the district's land is considered suitable for rice and
other field crops, while the area suitable for cultivating
fruit trees, consisting of rolling hills, is quite large.
Litchi saplings are established by cutting and planting small branches from existing trees. The young
trees begin to bear fruit in their third or fourth year,
and they continue growing in size and productivity
until perhaps the age of 15 years. They can remain
productive indefinitely, with one tree in the area reportedly being more than 200 years old. The trees
blossom in early spring (February and March), and
the fruit is harvested over 1 month's period in late
spring (May-June). However, a tree may not bear fruit
every year; reportedly only about 60% of trees bear
fruit in a given year. This may reflect weather conditions during the flowering period or other weather and
disease-related conditions. A serious disease problem
appeared in 1997 and 1998, apparently caused by a
fungus that affects trees in heavy or poorly drained
soils and which kills infected trees in a relatively short
time. New management practices such as reducing
planting depth, improving soil drainage, and greater
tree pruning are being promoted to reduce this risk, and
a chemical treatment has also been developed which
saves about 60% of affected trees if they can be treated
at an early stage of the disease.
Litchi was introduced into the area in the 1960s
by farm families migrating from nearby Hai Duong
province. Litchi production in Luc Ngan district has
developed primarily since 1987, about the beginning
of the doi moi economic renovation period in Vietnam.

yields from 1991 to 1998 for Luc Ngan district. The
most significant trend in this data seems to be the rapid
growth in the planted area, growing from 1500 ha in
1991 to more than 7000ha in 1998. Of these 7000ha,
about 4000 have trees old enough to produce fruit.
Local officials hope to see this expansion continue,
with a goal of 10,000 ha planted by the year 2005.
Table 2 shows similar data for Tru Huu commune, the
particular commune in Luc Ngan district visited for
this study.
A survey in May 1998 collected information from
Tru Huu farmers regarding their production practices
for both crop and livestock enterprises, their income
and credit situations, and other personal characteristics. One hundred households were interviewed.
Several relevant results are reported here.

Average values for minimum, maximum, and most
likely litchi yields were 4.1, 8.8, and 6.5 t/ha, respectively. This is significantly higher than the district average yield, 1.49 t/ha, or the commune average yield,
2.29 t/ha, over the 1991-1998 period. Further investigation revealed that Tru Huu commune had more early
adopters of litchi production than elsewhere in the district, and the greater maturity of their trees accounts
for at least some of the differences in yields.
Further litchi yield information was collected using a "visual impact method," where farmers placed
counters into various yield ranges to assess their probabilities (see Hardaker et al., 1997). From this information, a yield dist:J.ibution was derived for each
farmer. The average yield across all 100 farms from
these calculations was 6.22 t/ha, with a standard deviation of 1.44 t, or a coefficient of variation of about
26%. This suggests somewhat more variability than
the minimum and modal yields reported above, where
the minimum yield was 63% of the modal yield. Litchi
yields on individual farms also seem more variable
than the aggregate yields for the district and commune
seen in Tables 1 and 2. The lowest district yield from
1991 to 1998 was 1.25 t/ha, about 84% of the average,
while the lowest commune yield over this period was
2.10 t/ha, about 91% of average.
Farmers reported that the litchi price varies significantly by season, with a low of about 11,000 dong/kg
at harvest and an off-season high of as much as 22,000
dong/kg (at that time, the exchange rate was about
13,000-14,000VN dong= US$1). Storage and processing is a problem, so most output is marketed as
fresh fruit shortly after harvest. Farmers reported that
they expected to get an average price of about 13,000
dong/kg.
Litchi production appeared to be quite profitable.
With an average yield of about 235 kg/sao (in northern
Vietnam, one sao equals 360m2 ) and a market price
of 13,000 dong/kg, average revenue per sao is about
3.055 million dong. Farmers reported variable costs
of only about 150,000 dong per sao for litchi, leaving a significant amount for land taxes, other overhead
costs, and living expenses. A litchi sapling costs only
about 10,000 dong, so more trees can be planted at
relatively little expense. A comparison with rice production shows that litchi was nearly five times more
profitable. As a result, farmers in Tru Huu only planted
rice for home consumption, not for commercial sales.

176

Nearly all households also had some kind of
small-scale livestock activity. The most common of
these was raising market hogs, with 85 households
engaged in this activity. The average annual production was about 240 kg per year (roughly two slaughter
hogs), with the great majority of production being
sold commercially. Just over half the households
raised chickens, mainly for household consumption,
while just over one quarter of the households had sow
farrowing operations. Livestock were fed mostly crop
residues and by-products and table scraps, so there
was very little cash expense in these operations.
Regarding credit, 68 households said they had received loans the previous year from a special government program to promote fruit production. The typical
loan in this program was for an amount of 1 million
dong, at 0.7% interest per month, with a repayment
period of 5 years. Only six other households reported
borrowing money from other sources for agricultural
purposes. Only three households reported borrowing
money for non-agricultural purposes.
Only 18 households reported any non-farm income,
and only a few of these received significant amounts
of such. Non-farm income does not play a role in
most families' financial plans. The average farm size
among households in the sample was about 11 sao
(about 0.4 ha), which is larger than average in northem Vietnam. The typical farm household included
five people, and farmers had attended school for an
average of 7 years.
Total annual household income averaged 26.6 million dong, or about 6.2 million dong per person in
the household (roughly US$ 1973 and US$ 427, respectively). These amounts are noticeably higher than
average for farm households in northern Vietnam.
They seem best explained by the higher profitability of litchi production (compared to rice) and the
relatively larger farm size. Average annual farm income per household was 24.6 million dong, and the
average for minimum annual farm income was 19.4
million dong (about 79% of average annual farm income). The major source of income was litchi production.
These results answer some of the questions posed
above. First, it appears that crop insurance is probably not necessary to promote the adoption of litchi
production. The relatively high profitability of litchi
production probably explains the rapidly expanding

litchi plantings, and these will likely continue regardless of whether crop insurance is introduced.
Second, farm incomes do not appear extremely variable. While litchi yields showed some variability, it
appears that farmers can expect at least two-thirds of
their average incomes in even the worst of years. Farm
incomes in the sample, while certainly low, were still
above average for farmers in northern Vietnam, and
farmers reported that they didn't expect to experience
income levels less than about 75% of this average.
Crop insurance for litchi could provide more stability
to farmers' incomes, but it doesn't appear necessary
to guarantee a subsistence level of income.
It's not clear whether crop insurance would improve
farmers' access to credit. Farm loans came almost
entirely from a special one-time credit program targeted specifically at promoting fruit tree production,
and two-thirds of farm households participated in this
program. This suggests that farmers are at least interested in borrowing money to support and expand their
farming enterprises. Other agricultural lenders do not
appear to be serving farmer needs very well. Closer
examination of lender policies is needed to determine
if crop insurance could serve as collateral and improve
access to credit.

3. A hypothetical insurance program
for litchi farmers
To assess farmers' interest in crop insurance, they
were surveyed a second time in September 1998 about
participating in a hypothetical insurance program for
litchi production. This section describes how the insurance was designed.
First, the insurance was designated as all-risk
insurance, rather than specific-risk insurance. The
specific risk that concerned farmers most was the relatively recent problem of disease mentioned above.
However, an insurance program specifically covering
this disease was considered inappropriate for several
reasons: insurance could create a moral hazard in caring for the trees, since management practices affect
the disease's occurrence and its treatment; adverse
selection might be a problem, since farmers alone
would know which trees were planted deeply and
thus more prone to disease; and finally, only 2 years
of data would make it difficult to estimate premiums

M.L. Vandeveer/ Agricultural Economics 26 (2001) 173-184

accurately. Farmers also said they worried about losses
due to the weather, but this was expressed as a concern
for weather in general terms rather than specific perils, such as drought, hail, wind, etc. Consequently, an
all-risk insurance program was considered most appropriate.
Next, should the insurance be based on individual
farm yields or some kind of area yield? Several factors
suggested that an area-based program would be more
appropriate. First, area yield histories were available in
the form of district and commune yield records, which
would be needed to set coverage levels and estimate
premiums. Few farmers had similar yield records. Second, the opportunity for fraud would be much greater
with individual coverage, since farmers could easily
conceal some output and claim a loss. Also, the administrative cost for monitoring an extremely large
number of small farmers would be prohibitive. Similarly, other administrative costs would be higher with
individual coverage, since multiple premium schedules would be needed, each farm's yield history would
have to be examined in order to assign the appropriate premium, and every individual loss would have
to be verified. These kinds of administrative costs are
greatly reduced in an area-based scheme, since only
the area yield is needed to establish premiums and
evaluate losses.
Which type of area unit would be most appropriate? To the extent that farm and area yields differ in
frequency and severity, area insurance does not provide an effective "yield hedge" (Barnaby and Skees,
1990). Thus, farmers would likely want the area defined in a way such that the area yield tracks closely
with their own farm yields.
Two area units were used for the hypothetical insurance. The first area was defined as Luc Ngan district, since production conditions and weather patterns
are fairly homogeneous over the area. However, out of
concern that farmers might fear that the district yield
would not reflect their own, Tru Huu commune was
defined as a second area. This commune is one of
more than 30 communes in the district, and it is the
commune where the interviewed farmers lived, greatly
reducing any chance that the area yield might differ
significantly from their own yields. Several years of
yield history were available at both the district level
and the commune level for setting coverage levels and
premiums.

177

Yield guarantee levels were set at 90 and 85%
of the areas' expected yields. These relatively high
percentages were used because of the low variability
found in the areas' historical yields. Setting expected
area yields and the consequent insurance coverage
levels was complicated by the fact that tree productivity depends heavily on tree age, and that the planted
area contained a large percentage of land with relatively young trees. Thus, average yield for an area
could change substantially simply due to greater maturity and productivity of older trees, or conversely,
due to a large number of young trees just beginning
to bear fruit. In other words, while part of the area
yield variation is due to weather, disease, pests, and
other hazards, another part is due to the changing age
distribution and thus changing productivity of the tree
population. Both types of effects must be considered.
Ideally, expected area yield could be estimated by
a survey determining the percentage of trees in various age categmies, along with estimates of productivity typical for each age category. Unfortunately, such
information was not available. Expected yields could
only be set using the yield histories seen in Tables 1
and 2. For the district, the expected yield was set at
1.5 t/ha, and for the commune, it was 2.4 t/ha.
Indemnity payments per sao were defined as an indemnity price times the difference between actual area
yield and the area yield guarantee when actual yield
is below the guaranteed yield. Three indemnity prices
were used: 15,000, 25,000, and 35,000 dong/kg. The
lowest indemnity price was set close to the normal
market price level, while the two higher indemnity
prices were offered in case farmers might be concerned that their own farm loss might be larger than
the area's yield loss. In this case, a higher indemnity
price makes the indemnity payment larger, thus offsetting the smaller yield loss at the area level. Miranda
(1991) and Mahul (1999) provide theoretical discussions about optimal coverage levels for area insurance.
The premiums were based on the yield histories
seen in Tables 1 and 2. Yield distributions were fitted
to the data, and expected yield losses below the yield
guarantee levels were calculated. Due to the extremely
low variability in this data, the "pure premiums" (the
amounts needed to pay only expected indemnities)
were quite low. Two kinds of loads were then added
to the pure premiums: the first was a fixed load set at
5000 dong/sao for the 15,000 indemnity price, with

178

M.L. Vandeveer/ Agricultural Economics 26 (2001) 173-184

propmtionately higher amounts added for the other
indemnity prices. Then an additional 30% load was
added to all of these premiums.
Two schedules were thus obtained for both the district and commune insurance. Premiums for the district
insurance were slightly higher than those for the commune insurance. In both cases, the premiums for the
85% yield guarantee were about two-thirds the amount
of those for the 90% yield guarantee. In all cases, the
premiums were relatively small in comparison to the
expected revenue; the highest premium for the district
insurance was 33,200 dong/sao, only 1.09% of the expected revenue of 3.055 million dong/sao mentioned
earlier. Even if farmers' yields were much lower, the
premium would still be in the range of 2-3% of expected revenue per sao.
The insurance was presented as a voluntary program. No mention was made to farmers as to whether
it was offered from a private company or through a
government agency.

4. Farmer response to area crop insurance
In September 1998, staff members of the Faculty of Economics and Rural Development at Hanoi
Agricultural University #1 interviewed the same 100
households regarding their interest in both the district insurance and the commune insurance. After
explaining how area insurance would work, the staff
offered the various insurance contracts to the farmers.

Specifically, farmers were asked whether they would
purchase a particular level of coverage or not. With
two yield guarantee levels and three indemnity prices,
this meant six possible coverage combinations for
each type. For each of these combinations, farmers
were first asked if they would purchase the coverage
at the higher premium level (pure premium + fixed
load + 30% load), and if they declined, then they
were offered the coverage at the lower premium (pure
premium + fixed load). Each household was given a
gift of 20,000 dong for participating in the survey.
Tables 3 and 4 show the number of farmers buying each of the contracts for the district insurance
and the commune insurance, respectively. Several
patterns are apparent in these results. First, farmers
showed greater interest for the district insurance than
for the commune insurance. This is surprising at first
glance, since the commune insurance was cheaper and
farmers' yields would probably follow the commune
yield more closely than the district yield. However,
the interviewers reported that many farmers believed
the expected commune yield used to establish the coverage levels was too low, meaning that they thought
it was very unlikely that the commune yield would
ever drop below the yield guarantee levels.
This is interesting, considering that the 1991-1998
average for the commune was 2.29 t/ha, while the
expected commune yield for the insurance program
was set at 2.4 t/ha. Considering that farmers in the
sample reported much higher yields than the district
or commune, the question arises whether farmers

calculated their yields on the same basis as official
statistics (e.g. yield from all trees, only mature trees,
only fruit-bearing trees, etc.) and how the official
statistics themselves were developed. Some clarifications on these issues may have helped farmers better
understand the relationship between their own farm
yields and area yields and coverage levels.
A second pattern in farmer responses is that farmers preferred the 90% yield guarantee level over
the 85% yield guarantee level. This might be related to the issue just mentioned: farmers perceived
the probability of area yield falling below 90%
of average to be rather low, but the probability of
falling below 85% would be even lower. This pattern
was true for both district insurance and commune
insurance.
A third result was that the farmers usually preferred
lower indemnity prices. Several explanations of this
result are possible. One might be that coverage with
a higher indemnity price also has a higher premium.
Another reason might be that farmers did not recognize that a higher indemnity price would provide a
higher indemnity in cases when their own yield loss
exceeded the area yield loss. It is also possible they
believed their own yield losses might follow the area
yields very closely, and that a higher indemnity price
was unnecessary. No additional questions measured
farmers' beliefs on any of these issues.
A fourth result is that farmers were not very responsive to reductions in premiums. In most cases,

reducing the premiums 30% encouraged only a few
more farmers to buy the insurance.
Participation was over 50% for only one of the district contracts, and was less than 50% for all of the
commune contracts. However, participation rates are
higher when considering how many farmers would
buy at least one contract. Table 5 shows the number
of contracts bought by each farmer - that is, how

many did not buy any insurance, how many bought at
least one contract, two contracts, and so on. For district insurance, the largest category is the category for
farmers buying only one contract, with more than 40
farmers responding this way. However, only 16 farmers did not buy any contracts at the high premium
level, and only 11 did not buy any at the low premium
level. So while farmers rejected most of the contracts,
a sizeable majority still said they would buy at least
one contract. For commune insurance, the pattern is
similar, although the number of farmers who did not
buy any insurance was higher.

5. An econometric model of insurance demand
What were the effects of insurance contract features and farmer characteristics on the decisions to buy
insurance? To examine this question, binomial logit
models were estimated for district and commune insurance decisions. There were 1200 observations for
each data set, representing the various combinations of
two yield guarantee levels, three indemnity prices, and
two premium levels. The following section describes
the model variables and regression results.
Three insurance contract features were used as explanatory variables: the premium, the yield guarantee level, and the indemnity price. One would expect
higher premiums to reduce demand for insurance. A
higher yield guarantee level represents a higher level
of protection, so the coefficient for this variable should
be positive. A higher indemnity price means a higher
indemnity payment whenever a loss occurs, so a higher
indemnity price should increase the demand for insurance (assuming no change in the premium).
Several farm and farmer characteristics were also
used in the model. The first two variables were personal characteristics, years in farming and education.
Two types of income variables were also included. The
first was the ratio of minimum farm income to average farm income. This variable measures the risk of
having relatively low income: when this ratio is low, a
farmer has more income variability and might be more
likely to buy insurance. The second income variable
is average total income, which includes both farm and
non-farm income. This measures the farmer's absolute income level, and it should also reflect the wealth
of the household, and probably farm size, too.

Two other variables were used to reflect farmers'
attitudes about risk and their responses to risk. The
first of these is the number of risks affecting litchi
yield that farmers mentioned on the first survey. These
included disease, weather, using outdated technology,
and bird damage, meaning the variable could range
from 0 to 4. Similarly, on the first survey farmers were
also asked about different management practices they
used to reduce risk for litchi. They mentioned three
kinds of responses: using improved cultivation methods, using chemicals against pests and disease, and
using other technological innovations. Thus, this variable could range in value from 0 to 3.
The final two variables were the number of trees
that died in 1997 and 1998, and the standard deviation
of litchi yield. Both variables were used to represent
litchi yield risk, and both variables should be positively correlated with higher demand for insurance.
The standard deviation oflitchi yield was derived from
the probability distributions elicited in the first survey.
Table 6 summarizes the description of these variables
and shows the abbreviated variable names used in later
tables.
The regressions were performed on both the district
insurance decisions and the commune insurance data
using the model described above. However, in both
cases there was an unexpected result: the coefficient
for the premium was positive, suggesting that farmers
will buy more insurance when the price is higher. A
problem of multicollinearity was suspected due to the
correlation between a higher premium, a higher yield
guarantee, and a higher indemnity price. In response
to this problem, the yield guarantee was instead represented with a dummy variable defined to be 1 when
the yield guarantee was 90% and 0 when it was 85%.
Regressions for this revised model were performed for
both types of insurance, and the results seemed more
satisfactory.
Table 7 shows the results for the district insurance
decisions. For the insurance contract variables, the coefficients for both the premium and the yield guarantee have the expected signs and t-statistics significant
at the 95% confidence level. The coefficient for the indemnity price is negative, perhaps contrary to intuition
but consistent with the patterns observed in Tables 3
and 4. It is significant at the 90% confidence level.
Among the seven explanatory variables for farm
and farmer characteristics, only three have coefficients

for average total income. This suggests that wealthier
farmers (who probably also have larger farms), were
more likely to buy insurance. The third significant coefficient was that for the number of risks mentioned
for litchi production. Its sign was negative, which surprisingly suggests that farmers who mentioned more
types of risk for litchi production were less likely to
buy insurance.

Regarding model summary statistics, the likelihood
ratio statistic for the model as a whole was significant

occurred when the farmers did buy insurance but the
model predicted they would not.
Table 8 shows the results of the regression for the
commune insurance decisions. Here, the contract variables have the same signs as in the district results,
though the coefficient for the premium is not statistically significant. There were somewhat different results for the farm and farmer characteristics, however.

The coefficients significant at a 90% confidence level
were those for the number of years farming, average
total income, and the number of dead trees. Younger
farmers, or those with less experience, were less likely
to buy commune insurance. Farmers with higher incomes were more likely to buy commune insurance,
similar to the case for district insurance. And farmers
with more dead trees in 1997-1998 were also more
likely to buy insurance. The ratio of minimum to average income had the expected sign here (farmers with
relatively lower minimum incomes were more likely
to buy insurance) and was significant at an 85% confidence level.
The summary statistics for the model are similar to
those for the district case. The likelihood ratio statistic
was highly significant and almost 79% of the insurance decisions were predicted correctly. Again, most
incorrect predictions occurred when the farmers did
buy insurance but the model predicted they would not.
Looking at the two sets of results, the coefficients
for the insurance contract variables came out mostly
as expected. However, the results related to farm and
farmer characteristics were rather disappointing. The
only clear result seems to be that farmers with higher
incomes, who are probably larger, wealthier farmers,
are more likely to buy insurance. Beyond that, it is
more difficult to predict who might buy insurance.
The regression coefficients can be converted to a
more usable form by calculating values for aggregate
choice probability elasticities. These are presented for
both district and commune models in Table 9. These

elasticities show the change in the percentage of farmers who would buy insurance when one of the explanatory variables is changed by a small amount. The most
important elasticity is that for the premium, which
can be interpreted similarly to a price elasticity. For
both district and commune insurance, the responses
to changes in premiums were inelastic; for the district insurance, a 10% reduction in the premium would
increase participation only 6.8%. For the commune
insurance, a 10% premium reduction would increase
participation about 2.2%.

6. Some conclusions
This study evaluated the need for a crop insurance
program for litchi production in northern Vietnam and
how farmers there might participate in such a program.
Two hypothetical insurance plans were developed and
presented to them.
Results indicate there is not a strong case for establishing such a crop insurance program. While
insurance would reduce the variability of farm income, it is not needed to promote adoption of litchi,
a very profitable crop, nor is farm income so variable
that farmers' subsistence needs are threatened without insurance. Litchi producers already have incomes
substantially above average for farmers in northern
Vietnam, so using insurance to provide a subsidy for
poverty alleviation would seem to have little merit,
too.
Regarding insurance design, all-risk insurance
based on area yields was considered the most appropriate form of coverage. The biggest challenge in
designing the coverage turned out to be establishing
an expected area yield on which to base the yield
guarantees. Vmiation in tree productivity by age and
a rapidly expanding planted area have the potential
to substantially change the area's average yield, quite
apart from the effects of weather and other risks.
In spite of these difficulties, a majority of farmers
were willing to buy some kind of crop insurance if it
were available. Farmers clearly preferred higher yield
guarantees and lower indemnity prices. Even after
some significant loading, the premiums, which were
based on each area's yield history, were relatively low
compared to the typical amount of revenue that litchi
production can generate. Farmer response to premium

M.L. Vandeveer/ Agricultural Economics 26 (2001) 173-184

changes was inelastic. Other factors, such as farmers'
perceptions about yield coverage levels, were probably more important in their buying decisions. Farmers
with higher incomes were more likely to buy insurance, but the correlation between insurance demand
and other farmer characteristics was less clear.
It should be emphasized that this research did not
analyze some important aspects of insurance program
feasibility. For example, marketing methods, program
staffing needs, operating costs, and the amount of
reserves required for catastrophic losses would also
need to be evaluated. Administrative costs of crop insurance programs in developing countries appear to
vary widely. For example, Mishra's (1996) study of
India's area-based scheme found that administrative
costs accounted for less than 4% of total program
costs (p. 266); in contrast, the Philippines' crop insurance program had a loss ratio of 0.41 in 1996 but
still required subsidy to cover its administrative costs
(Philippine Crop Insurance Corporation, 1997).
The other major potential cost of the program,
of course, relates to the actuarial soundness of the
insurance. Setting accurate area yield coverage levels would be crucial to actuarial performance, as
artificially high values could lead to unwarranted indemnity payments. The premiums used in the study
carried significant loads and would reflect some margin for error; the most popular coverage level chosen
by farmers had what amounted to a 46% load on
top of the pure premium, while other coverage levels
carried even higher loads. Even so, probably only
several years of experience could reveal whether the
rates were in fact adequate.
Further analysis of these issues was not undertaken
because the other arguments for establishing an insurance program were not particularly strong. Farm
households observed in this survey can continue to
cope with risk through current practices, such as
household savings, a bit of enterprise diversification,
good production practices, borrowing from relatives,
and so on. And Vietnamese government investment in
agricultural programs would probably be best directed
elsewhere.
In conclusion, a few generalizations about insurance in a developing country context are also ventured.
First, area-based insurance offers some important advantages but also has some potential drawbacks. It is
hard to overestimate the importance of establishing

183

appropriate values for the expected area yields and the
related insurance coverage levels, both for achieving
significant farmer participation and for avoiding actuarial problems. Related to this, it seems worthwhile
to assess farmers' perceptions regarding area average
yield and area yield variability, as well as farmers'
perceptions of the correlation between their own
yields and area yields. Some educational effort might
be needed to correct any misconceptions. Some additional farmer education might also be needed to ensure
they understand when to use a higher indemnity price.
From a broader policy standpoint, the costs and benefits of establishing a crop insurance program must
naturally be compared with those of other agricultural
programs. Because government spending on agriculture so often faces serious limits in developing countries, investing in a crop insurance program might be
worthwhile only in more urgent cases, after careful
investigation indicates its value.
