Abstract
The efficiency of women fanners in the agricultural sector of developing countries is passionately debated. Very few studies have
examined this issue in African agriculture. All previous studies were based on production functions, but have been criticised as suffering
from simultaneous equation bias because the input levels are endogenous. The profit function method avoids these problems. No previous
study has used the profit function method to test for technical, allocative and economic efficiency differences between women and men
farmers. The objective of this paper was to determine whether women rice farmers are less efficient than men rice farmers in Cote d 'Jvoire
using the restricted normalised profit function method. Our results show that the relative degree of efficiency of women is similar to that of
men. The paper provides empirical support for efforts to eliminate bias against women fanners in African agriculture.

1. Introduction

The importance of women farmers in the agriculture of developing countries is widely recognised
(Boserup, 1970; Gladwin, 1991; Le1e, 1991). Women
provide a significant share of the labour (both family
and hired) for farm activities (Dixon, 1982), and are
important as primary producers of food crops (Dey,
1984; Dozon, 1985; FAO, 1985; Savane, 1985;
Weekes-Vagliani, 1985). Studies have shown that
women also play major roles in farm-level decisionmaking, either as farm managers managing their own
fields (Moock, 1976) or as 'effective decisionmakers' even in households in which the household

head is a male, either because of their specific skills
or when the husbands are absent for longer periods
because they are employed in urban areas (Quisumbing, 1994).
Despite their importance, women farmers face
daunting constraints to their productivity, arising
from limited access to extension, to capital markets,
and to new technologies (Birkhaeuser et al., 1991;
Bindlish and Evenson, 1993; Dey, 1984; Quisumbing, 1994; FAO, 1985). An argument often used
against female farmers is that they are less efficient
than male farmers (FAO, 1985). Efficiency has three
components: technical, allocative and economic.
Technical efficiency can be defined as the ability to
achieve a higher level of output, given a similar level
of production inputs. Allocative efficiency has to do
with the extent to which farmers make efficient
decisions by using inputs up to the level at which
their marginal contribution to production value is

equal to the factor cost. Economic efficiency combines technical and allocative efficiency. It is possible for a firm to have either technical or allocative
efficiency without having economic efficiency.
Technical and allocative efficiency are necessary,
and when they occur together, are sufficient conditions for achieving economic efficiency (Yotopoulos
and Nuggent, 1976).
Whether men are more efficient than women in
farm production is passionately debated. Only few
studies have examined this issue in Africa (Moock,
1976, Kenya; Saito et al., 1992, Kenya and Nigeria;
Bindlish and Evenson, 1993, Kenya; Bindlish et al.,
1993, Burkina Faso; Udry et al., 1995, Burkina
Faso), often with variable results. Using CobbDouglas production functions with dummy variables
to represent the gender of either the field owner
(Moock, 1976; Saito et al., 1992) or the head of the
household (Saito et al., 1992; Bindlish and Evenson,
1993; Bindlish et al., 1993), these studies found that
the coefficient of the gender dummy variable was
insignificant in Kenya (Moock, 1976; Saito et al.,
1992; Bindlish and Evenson, 1993) and Burkina
Faso (Bindlish et al., 1993). Results for Nigeria were
mixed, with the gender variable not significant when
data for total farm output at the household level were
used but were significantly higher for men when the
total value of production at the plot level was used
(Saito et al., 1992). Udry et al. (1995) examined
gender-based productivity differences in Burkina
Faso and found that output per hectare was lower on
plots controlled by women. However, such differences in productivity cannot be taken as indicative of
production inefficiency. When corrections were made
for the differences in input type and quality, the
authors noted that "The gender yield differential,
apparently, is caused by the difference in the intensity with which measured inputs of labour, manure
and fertiliser are applied on plots controlled by men
and women rather than by differences in the efficiency with which these inputs are used" (p. 416). In
production function estimates for all crops, sorghum
and vegetables (a crop in which women specialised),
Udry et al. (1995) found that except in the case of
sorghum, the coefficient on the gender variable was
not significant.
Criticisms of these studies have pointed out that
the reliance on production function methods to test

for allocative and economic efficiency suffers from
problems of simultaneity bias because input levels
are endogenously determined (Quisumbing, 1994).
In a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art studies
on gender and farm efficiency, Quisumbing ( 1994)
noted that such ''problems of endogeneity can be
avoided by estimating profit or cost functions instead
of production functions" (p. 8). Although applications of profit function analysis are extensive in the
efficiency literature (Yotopoulos and Lau, 1973; Lau,
1976; Khan and Maki, 1979; Saleem, 1988; Duraisamy, 1990), studies have not used this approach
to examine efficiency differences between men and
women farmers ( Quisumbing, 1994). This partly reflects the lack of appropriate gender-disaggregated
field data. Given that rice in West Africa is often
referred to as a 'woman's crop' -because of the
importance of women as primary producers and decision-makers on the rice fields (Dey, 1984; Carney,
1988)-it offers itself as an interesting crop with
which to examine this question. The objective of the
paper was to determine, using the restricted normalised profit function method (Yotopoulos and Lau,
1973; Lau, 1976), whether female rice farmers are
less efficient than male rice farmers in Cote d 'Ivoire.

2. Data
The gender-disaggregated data used for the analysis were collected in 1993-1994 from a random
sample of 347 men and 63 women rice farmers in
three districts of northern Cote d'Ivoire. The data
covered fertiliser applications, labour use (family and
hired), access to extension and credit, farm size,
paddy prices, wages, fertiliser prices, capital assets
and the farmers' education level (Table 1). We found
no significant difference in the access of women to
extension services; 98% of the men have access to
extension compared with 91% of the women farmers. Significant differences were found in access to
education and credit, however. Only 2% of the female farmers are educated (i.e. have ever attended
school) compared with 21% of the male farmers.
Women are also at a disadvantage in their access to
credit services. Eighty-six percent of men farmers
have access to credit compared with only 59% of the
women. Women also appear to receive less for their

output than men: the average price received for
paddy by men was 71 CFA kg- 1 , compared with a
mean farm-gate price of 62 CFA kg- 1 for women.
We did not observe any differences in quality or
grade of output between men and women farmers.
The higher prices obtained by men may reflect the
fact that men are better organised into farmer cooperatives than women, differences in the timing of
sales or the type of market outlets used.
No significant differences were seen in the use of
chemical fertiliser. Men applied 148 kg NPK ha- 1
compared with 126 kg ha- 1 for women, whereas the
application of urea was 70 kg ha- 1 for the men and
73 kg ha- 1 for women. Average expenditure on the
use of other inputs (i.e. insecticides and herbicides)
was similar for both men and women farmers; women
spent an average of 15 600 CFA ha- 1 on these
inputs compared with II 200 CFA ha- 1 for men.
Women in the sample also have access to the use of
mechanised equipments (i.e. oxen or tractors) mainly
through an equipment rental market that is active in
the region of study. Average yields obtained by
female farmers was 1.5 kg ha -I compared with 2.0
kg ha- 1 for the male farmers. However, mean values, by masking the substantial inter-farm variability
in yields, resource endowments, and factor-use proportions across fields of female and male farmers,

Using the output price as the numeraire, the normalised restricted profit function ( 7T * (q,Z)) can be
written in a generalised form as

where qj represents the normalised factor prices, F
is a well behaved production function, X is the
vector of variable inputs and Z is the vector of fixed
inputs used in the production process. Starting with
any well specified normalised restricted profit function, direct application of Hottelings-Shephard' s
Lemmas to the function yields the corresponding
factor demand and output supply equations

that the errors of the system of equations are additive
with zero mean and finite variance. For the same
farm, the co-variance of the error terms in these
equations are nonzero, while the co-variance of error
terms of any of the equations for different farms are
assumed to be zero. Following previous studies,
Zellners' seemingly unrelated regression method
(SUR) was used to estimate the system of equations
in order to obtain asymptotically efficient parameter
estimates.
The results of the estimated equations are presented in Table 2. The coefficients all have the
expected theoretical signs and nine of the ten variables are significant at between the 5% and 1%
levels. As is theoretically consistent, the coefficients
of the prices for fertiliser and labour are negatively
signed as expected. Capital and land are highly
significant in the profit function.

significance. Hypothesis one (HI) states that the
economic efficiency (technical and price or allocative efficiency) of men and women farmers are
equal. This hypothesis cannot be rejected. The second hypothesis (H2) states that the relative price or
allocative efficiency of men and women farmers is
equal, i.e. they equate the value of marginal product
of labour to wage rate and the value of marginal
product of fertiliser to fertiliser price to the same
degree. Although the hypothesis being tested is the
equality of the elasticities of the variable inputs of
men and women in the factor share equations, the
test is better conceptualised as (a/ m - ei * ) = (a/ f
- 8/ ), for i = I ,2. This hypothesis cannot be rejected. Hypothesis three (H3) states that there is
equal relative technical and price efficiency jointly
between men and women farmers. This hypothesis
cannot be rejected. This is not surprising given the
test results of HI and H2. Hypothesis four (H4)
states that men farmers have absolute allocative or
price efficiency, i.e. they maximise profits by equating the value of each factor's marginal product to the

51

respective factor price. This hypothesis is rejected.
Hypothesis five (H5) states that women farmers have
absolute allocative efficiency. This hypothesis cannot
be rejected for the female sample. Hypothesis six
(H6) states that there are constant returns to scale
under the maintained hypothesis of absolute price
efficiency for men and women farmers (and thus of
equal relative price efficiency). This hypothesis is
rejected. There is evidence of decreasing returns to
scale for the underlying technology on the farms of
both men and women farmers.
To determine the effects of individual production
factors on paddy output for the sample farmers, we
used identities that link the self-dual profit function
with the primal production function (Sidhu, I 97 4;
Yotopoulos et a!., 1976; Duraisamy, 1990). It has
been shown (Yotopoulos and Lau, 1973) that the
indirect production elasticities for the variable inputs
can be derived from the self-dual profit function
used above, as a 1 = -a/ (I - /.L * )- 1 , where a/
corresponds to the estimated parameters of the factor
prices of these variables in the dual profit function,
and /.L * = ~ a/ . The elasticities of the fixed factors
are computed as {31 = - f3/ (1 - /.L' )- 1 , where {31 is
the indirect elasticity of production with respect to
the fixed factor. These indirect production elasticity
estimates have been shown to have statistical consistency (Sidhu, I 974). Using the pooled sample of
farmers (male and female) we estimated these indirect production elasticities. Our estimates (Table 4)
show that the elasticity of paddy output is highest
with respect to labour (0.42), followed by fertilisers
(0.27), land (0.20), and capital (0.04). An increase of
labour use by I 0% will increase paddy output by
4.2%. Similarly, a 10% increase in fertiliser, land,
and capital is expected to lead to 2.7%, 2.0% and

0.4% increases in paddy output. The highly inelastic
response to land and capital may reflect the presence
of other technological and infrastructural constraints
that limit rice productivity. These results also show
that labour is the most limiting factor in rice production, suggesting that the technologies that enhance
the productivity of labour are likely to achieve significant positive effects on rice production.

4. Conclusions
This paper presents the results of an empirical
application of the profit function method to test for
efficiency differences between men and women
farmers in African agriculture. Such an application
was called for in a recent comprehensive review of
the literature on gender and farm efficiency
(Quisumbing, 1994). In particular, the results suggest
that generalisations on efficiency or otherwise of
men and women farmers should be avoided as this
would be erroneous at best: efficiency is often dependent on the location and context of the agricultural systems. We found that the relative degree of
economic efficiency of women rice farmers is similar to that of men rice farmers in Cote d'lvoire.
Results show that women farmers have absolute
allocative efficiency in the use of the inputs at their
disposal, although this did not translate into having
higher economic efficiency due possibly to lack of
better technical options. Also, evidence from the
field survey show that men farmers are able to get
higher prices for their rice than women, a situation
that may reflect the better organisation of men farmers into cooperatives.
One major reason for the neglect of women in
rice development projects in West Africa is the
erroneous, yet pervasive, assumption that female
farmers are less efficient than male farmers. Thus,
even in regions of West Africa where women are the
traditional rice growers, and rice is considered as a
woman's crop, rice development projects choose to
focus on men and not women (Dey, 1981, 1984).
Results from this paper suggest that there is no
economic rationale for biasing rice development
strategies towards male farmers in Cote d'Ivoire, as
female farmers, when they have access to similar
inputs, have equal levels of economic efficiency.
