Abstract
This paper represents a dynamic specification of the Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS) based on recent developments on
cointegration techniques and error correction models. Based on Greek meat consumption data over the period 1958-1993, it
was found that the proposed formulation performs well on both theoretical and statistical grounds, as the theoretical properties
of homogeneity and symmetry are supported by the data and the LeChatelier principle holds. Regardless of the time horizon,
beef and chicken may be considered as luxuries while mutton-lamb and pork as necessities. In the short-run, beef was found
to have price elastic demand, pork an almost unitary elasticity, whereas mutton-lamb, chicken and sausages had inelastic
demands; in the long-run, beef, and pork were found to have a demand elasticity greater than one, whereas mutton-lamb,
chicken, and sausages still had inelastic demands. All meat items are found to be substitutes to each other except chicken and
mutton-lamb, and pork and chicken. ©2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
The Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS), developed by Deaton and Muellbauer (1980), is by far the
most commonly used demand system specification in
the last 15 years. During the period 1980-1991, 89
empirical applications used the AIDS in demand studies (Buse, 1994). At the same time, a lot of effort has
been devoted into two interrelated problems associated with the specification and the estimation of the
AIDS: the first one has to do with the choice between
its linear or non-linear specification and the second
with the choice of an aggregate commodity price de* Corresponding author. Tel.: +30-31-843-095;

flator (Pashardes, 1993; Buse, 1994; Moschini, 1995).
Despite these problems, the AIDS remains one of the
better alternative available for empirical demand analysis. Until recently, the AIDS has been estimated with
conventional econometric techniques, i.e. OLS, SUR
and MLE, without paying any attention to either the
statistical properties of the data or the dynamic specification arising from time series analysis.
Recently though, two studies have attempted to incorporate dynamic elements into the AIDS by relying
on the statistical properties of the data. Balcombe and
Davis (1996), on the one hand, proposed the canonical cointegrating regression procedure for estimating
the AIDS. This procedure is used in cases where commodity prices follow a distributed lag process, or there
is a seasonal pattern. On the other hand, Karagiannis and Velentzas ( 1997), outlined the potential use of

an error correction model (ECM) of the AIDS. Based
on the time series properties of the data and as long
as cointegration between the dependent and a linear
combination of independent variables is ensured, an
ECM for the AIDS can be established and econometrically estimated it with an iterative seemingly unrelated
regression (ISUR) procedure. For annual time series
data, the latter approach seems more appropriate.
This paper builds on previous work by Karagiannis
and Velentzas (1997) and to some extent expands it.
We further explore the methodology for testing and
setting an error correction form of demand systems
by presenting a more complete set of alternative tests
that can be used to establish long-run demand relationships. Moreover, given the structure of an ECM, shortand long-run demand responses can be analyzed. In
the applied counterpart, the paper provides empirical
evidence and measures of short- and long-run elasticity estimates for an ECM-AIDS for meat demand in
Greece over the period 1958-1993.
Meat demand has been of major interest in applied
demand analysis for many countries in recent years.
There are a number of studies for US (e.g. Eales and
Unnevehr, 1988, 1993; Moschini and Meilke, 1989;
Moschini and Vissa, 1993; Moschini et al., 1994;
Nayga and Capps, 1994; Brester and Schroeder, 1995;
Kesavan and Buhr, 1995; Holt and Goodwin, 1997),
for Canada (Chalfant et al., 1991; Chen and Veeman,
1991; Reynolds and Goddard, 1991; Xu and Veeman,
1996), for Japan (Hayes et al., 1990), for Australia
(Cashin, 1991), for Saudi Arabia (Al-Kahtani and
Sofian, 1995), for UK (Bewley and Young, 1987;
Burton and Young, 1992; Burton et al., 1994, 1996;
Tiffin and Tiffin, 1999), for France (Fulponi, 1989),
for Italy (Dono and Thompson, 1994), for Norway
(Rickertsen, 1996), and for Greece (Karagiannis et
al., 1996).
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The
empirical model and the econometric results are presented in the following two sections, respectively.
Elasticity estimates are reported in the Section 4.
Concluding remarks follow.

2. Empirical modeling
In the subsequent analysis, it is assumed that consumers' preferences are weakly separable with respect

to meat, and thus, a two-stage budgeting process is im~
plied. In the first stage, consumers decide how much
of their total expenditure will be allocated to meat,
and then, in the second stage, the demand for each
meat item is determined by the prices of the individual
meat items and meat expenditures. The AIDS is compatible with this procedure since it aggregates across
goods under the assumption of weak separability of
preferences. A linear formation of the AIDS is used
in budget-share form:

where

si

is the budget-share of the ith commodity,

p j is the price of the jth commodity, m represents
total food expenditure and P is an aggregate price

index. In the above equation, linearity arises from the
way of specifying the aggregate price index, which
in the linear formulation of the AIDS is treated as
exogenous. Most often the aggregate price index is
approximated by the Stone's price index, the use of
which causes inconsistencies in parameter estimates
(Pashardes, 1993; Buse, 1994; Moschini, 1995). These
inconsistencies are, however, more serious in micro
rather than aggregate data (Pashardes, 1993). Recently,
Asche and Wessells (1997), have shown that the AIDS
and the linearized AIDS representations are identical
at the point of approximation as long as the prices in
the system are normalized to one.
Following Karagiannis and Velentzas (1997), first
of all it is necessary to investigate the time-series properties of data used in Eq. (1) before specifying the
most appropriate dynamic form, in order to be able to
formally assess whether the long-run demand relationships are economically meaningful or merely spurious.
Initially, the number of unit roots should be identified
for each individual time-series (i.e. the order of integration). This may be implemented by using either the
Dickey-Fuller, the augmented Dicker-Fuller (Dickey
and Fuller, 1981), the Philips-Perron (Phillips, 1987;
Perron, 1988), or the Johansen test. A shortcoming of
the Johansen procedure in the case of applied consumer demand analysis is that there is no a priori information to exclude some vectors as theoretically inconsistent whenever more than one cointegrated vector is found. This is because the sign of the elements
of the cointegrated vectors, indicating substitutability

31

G. Karagiannis et al./Agricultural Economics 22 (2000) 29-35

or complementary behavior between goods, cannot a
priori be restricted. Neither the sign of the elements
corresponding to own-price effects is sufficient to exclude some of the cointegrated vectors, as even a positive sign may under certain circumstances result in a
downward sloping demand. For these reasons, the use
of the other three tests is recommended.
Wherever both S; and the vector of explanatory
variables are integrated on the same order, cointegration can be established for all meat items. However,
it is also possible to have a cointegrated regression
even though the variables of interest have different
time series properties and thus, a different order of
integration. According to Granger representation theorem, a linear combination of series with a different
order of integration may consist a cointegrated regression. Therefore, ultimate time-series properties are not
a necessary condition to proceed further. If, however,
cointegration cannot be established for at least one
share equation, we cannot proceed further and more
likely a different functional specification may be used
or the data set should be enlarged.
Given the low power of static cointegration tests to
discriminate against alternative hypothesis, a dynamic
modeling procedure recommended by Banerjee et al.
(1986) and Kremers et al. (1992), may also be used
to test for cointegration between expenditure, commodity prices, and real expenditure. According to this
methodology, at a first instance an ECM is formulated
and estimated. Then, the hypothesis that the coefficient
of the error correction term is not statistically significant is tested by using a traditional t-test. If the null
hypothesis is not rejected, the series concerned are not
cointegrated. Otherwise, the existence of cointegration
between the relevant variables is ensured. In the presence of possible autocorrelation, which may be a cause
of non-stationarity of residuals, stationarity may also
be examined by using Box-Pierce Q-statistic. Absence
of serial correlation means that the estimated residuals
are stationary implying that the variables concerned
are cointegrated.
Nevertheless, in the above three cases an ECM version of the AIDS can be set up and estimated using a seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) procedure, which adjusts for cross-equation contemporaneous correlation and consequently takes into account
the optimization process behind any demand system.
At this stage, the imposition of symmetry and linear

homogeneity restrictions can be statistically tested. To
implement it further, a budget-share equation, which
in this case is that of sausages, should be excluded
(adding-up property). Since SUR is sensitive to the
excluded equation, the procedure should be iterated.
The process of iteration ensures that the obtained estimates asymptotically approach those of the maximum
likelihood method (Judge et al., 1980).

3. Econometric results
In the empirical analysis, annual time-series data
on food expenditures are obtained from several issues of the National Accounts, published by the
National Statistical Service of Greece. Current and
constant (at 1970 prices) meat expenditures are aggregated into five categories: beef (BE); mutton and
lamb (ML); chicken (CH); pork (PO); and sausages
(SA). The price index corresponding to each meat
group is derived by dividing current by constant
expenditures.
The results related to the time-series properties
of these data are reported in Table 1. Based on a
Phillips-Perron test (Phillips, 1987; Perron, 1988),
the hypothesis that all the variables in Eq. (1) contain

32

In Eq. (2), !':i refers to the difference operator, ftit-l
are the estimated residuals from cointegration equations, and Ai < 0. At this stage, there are two alternative estimation procedures: the two-step method of
Engle and Granger (1987), and a nonlinear regression
technique by substituting (1) for /Lit-! in (2). The Engle and Granger's (Engle and Granger, 1987) two-step
method is applied by substituting the estimated parameters values from the cointegration Eq. (1) into the
ECM equation to obtain parameter estimates in Eq.
(2). This is equivalent to use the estimated residuals
from the cointegration equations as a regressor in Eq.
(2). For the purposes of the present paper, Engle and
Granger's two-step method is used.
The habit effects embedded in Eq. (2) may be referred to as short memory, linear habit formation, with

additive persistence effects 2 . The term short memory
is used because only last period's consumption pattern (i.e. a one-period lag) is allowed to condition current allocation decisions. Thus, in our formation (2),
it indicates that previous distribution of food expenditures affects current decisions. This formulation is
quite similar to that used by Kesavan and Buhr (1995).
The hypotheses of linear homogeneity, and symmetry and homogeneity, are also tested. Based on a Wald
test, the maintenance of both homogeneity, and symmetry and homogeneity, cannot be rejected at a 5%
significance level. For homogeneity testing the calculated value of x2 is 5.31 and the corresponding tabulated value is 9.49 for 4 degrees of freedom and 5%
level of significance, whereas for homogeneity and
symmetry testing the calculated value of x2 is 17.82
and the corresponding tabulated value is 18.31 for
10 degrees of freedom and 5% level of significance.
This suggests that the empirical results are at least
theoretically consistent and valid for this functional
specification.
The estimated parameters reported in Table 2 possess both properties of homogeneity and symmetry.
The computed budget-shares satisfy monotonicity
and the concavity of the underlying (true) expenditure function is ensured by the fact that all own-price
Hicksian elasticities (see Table 4) are negative, and
consequently the corresponding Slutsky matrix is negative semi-definite. Finally, the estimated parameters
of the error correction terms, A.;, are all statistically
significant and have the correct signs, indicating that
deviations from long-run equilibrium are corrected
within the time period. It is also worth noting that
the significance of the error correction terms in SUR
estimates is consistent with the previously obtained
results of cointegration analysis.
The hypothesis of the overall habit formation cannot be rejected. Based on Wald test, the calculated
value of x2 for testing habits formation is 17.07
and the corresponding tabulated value is 9.49 for 4
degrees of freedom and 5% level of significance.
Nevertheless, habits seem to be of low importance in
explaining chicken consumption patterns. Thus, pre-

At this point we recognized the limited number of observations
for conducting cointegration tests. For this reason, we have used
the Engle and Granger's (1987) methodology, which provides
reliable estimates with a small sample size.

2 More general forms of habit formation are developed by Holt
and Goodwin (1997). They considered the long memory, nonlinear,
non-additive habit effect as the most general formation, which
may be nested to short memory, linear habit formation used in
this paper.

a unit root cannot be rejected at the 10% significance level. When first differences are used, unit
root non-stationarity was rejected at the same level
of significance. This indicates that the levels of all
tested variables are non-stationary, i.e. 1(1), and thus,
a standard statistical inference is validated (Dickey
and Fuller, 1981). The next step is to test for cointegration between the variables of Eq. (1) using
the Engle and Granger (1987) methodology 1 . According to the result reported in the third column
of Table 1 all budget-shares are cointegrated with
commodity prices and real expenditure at a 10%
significance level. Cointegration ensures that shocks
affecting commodity prices or real expenditures will
be reflected on different expenditure shares in a similar way showing that these variables are moving
together in the long-run and obey an equilibrium
constraint.
Having established that all the variables in Eq. (1)
are 1(1) process and cointegrated, the estimated ECM

vious years' (relative) expenditure for chicken does
not affect the current meat expenditure allocation
decisions and consumers are able to adjust chicken
consumption to long-run equilibrium considerably
faster than consumption the other meat items. That
is, the current chicken consumption adjusts by 89%
to the difference between the previous years' and the
long-run consumption levels. This is a consequence
of the low importance of habits in explaining chicken
consumption patterns. On the other hand, according to
the estimated parameters reported in Table 2, the rate
of change in the budget-share of beef, mutton-lamb,
and pork has been exaggerated over time. That is,
habits induced a faster rate of expansion of these meat
items' budget-share.

Estimates of short-run elasticities are obtained by using the above formulas and the estimated parameters
of (2), while their long run counterparts are measured
by using the same formulas and the estimated parameters of the cointegration equations (Johnson et al.,
1992).
The short-run own-price Marshallian elasticities for
all meat items are found to be negative, and thus
the corresponding demand and pork curves are downward sloping (see Table 3). Beef was found to have
price elastic demand, pork an almost unitary elasticity, whereas mutton-lamb, chicken and sausages had
inelastic demands. When the long-run own-price Marshallian elasticities are considered, beef and pork were
found to have a demand elasticity greater than one,
whereas mutton-lamb, chicken and sausages still had
inelastic demands. It is interesting to note that the

two meat items with both short- and long-run inelastic demand (i.e. mutton-Iamb and chicken) exhibited
only minimal changes in price response between the
short and long run. Given that short-run elasticities are
smaller than their long-run counterparts for all meat
items, the LeChatelier principle holds 3 .
The estimated expenditure elasticities are also reported on Table 3. Beef and chicken were found to
have a short-run elasticity greater than one, indicating that these two meat items can be considered to be
luxuries. On the other hand, mutton-Iamb, pork, and
sausages were found to behave as necessities. In the
long run, all meat items except sausages, exhibited
similar behavior with regard to expenditure changes.
That is, only sausages tended to change for a necessary
good in the short-run to a luxury good in the long run.
Finally, given the magnitude of short- and long-run
expenditure elasticities it is clear that the LeChatelier
principle is also satisfied with regard to expenditure
elasticities.
All meat items are found to be substitutes to each
other except chicken and mutton-lamb, and pork and
chicken (see Table 4). Sausages however, have, a totally different behavior as it is found to be complement with all other meat items except beef. This result may be explained by the fact that sausages is a
meat by-product, which is not used for basic nutrition
needs, but mainly as an appetizer good. Unfortunately,
there are no previous empirical results in this issue,
especially based on evidence from other countries, to
provide an alternative line of comparison.
3 The LeChatelier principle states that long-run demand fimctions are more price and expenditure sensitive than their short-run
counterparts. Thus, at the optimum, price and expenditure elasticities are greater in long-rather than short-run (Silberberg, 1992,
pp. 216-222).

Compared with previous findings by Karagiannis
et al. (1996), on meat demand in Greece, the estimated own-price Marshallian elasticities in the present
study are greater for beef and mutton-lamb and smaller
for chicken, pork and sausages. Accordingly, the estimated expenditure elasticities are greater compared
to the findings of Karagiannis et al. (1996), for all
the meat items considered in this study except for
mutton-lamb, which are close to each other. These differences may be due to different aggregation schemes,
time periods covered, model specification and econometric estimation techniques.

5. Concluding remarks
This paper represents a dynamic specification of the
AIDS based on recent developments on cointegration
techniques and error correction models. The AIDS is
adjusted accordingly to give rise to an AIDS-ECM.
Based on the Greek meat consumption data over the
period 1958-1993, it was found that the proposed
formulation performs well in both theoretical and
statistical grounds. In particular, the theoretical properties of homogeneity and symmetry are supported
by the data and thus the obtained elasticity estimates
are valid and accurate for policy issues analysis. This
suggests that more attention should be paid to the
statistical properties of the data before a particular
specification of the expenditure share equation is
chosen.
The proposed model has also the ability to provide
estimates of both short- and long-run demand elasticities, a feature that significantly enlarges the alternatives for policy simulations. Given that in the case of
meat consumption in Greece, short- and long-run demand elasticities have great differences to each other
(except for chicken) price or income changes is expected to affect quite differently consumers behavior.
For chicken, however, the difference between shortand long-run price elasticities is very small (see Table 3) and given the low importance of habits formation, it is expected that will not be any significant difference between consumers reaction to price
changes in the short- and long-run. In contrast, this is
not the case for the other meat items considered in this
study.
