Abstract
The double hurdle model is used to analyse the off-farm labour decisions of small-scale agricultural household members
in the Shamva District of Zimbabwe. The approach permits the joint modelling of the decision to participate in the labour
market and the decision regarding the amount of time allocated to work. Results indicate that a number of variables (notably,
gender, education and assets) indeed have effects which are qualitatively and quantitatively different in terms of participation
and hours worked. Overall, the empirical analysis confirms the importance of individual characteristics (such as gender and
education) and household/farm characteristics (e.g. land area accessible to the household, productive assets, remittances and
the agricultural terms of trade) in influencing the labour market decisions of rural household members.

1. Introduction
There is mounting evidence that rural non-farm
income is an important resource for rural households
and that policy-makers are showing increasing interest in non-farm activities as a means of creating
favourable conditions to reduce poverty in rural areas
(FAO, 1998). Although there is some debate about the
impact of non-farm employment on the distribution of
income (see, for example, Reardon et al., 2001), it is
generally agreed that non-farm income is a significant
input to rural household economies and contributes

to food security by allowing better access to food. It
also has positive spin-offs in agricultural performance
by providing cash for productivity-enhancing inputs,
thus easing credit constraints, and in turn, a more
dynamic agricultural sector enhances the scope and
scale of the non-farm sector. If policy interventions
are to be directed at increasing economic activity and
employment in rural areas, a better understanding of
the labour allocation decisions of rural households
is required. This paper aims to contribute in this regard by analysing the off-farm labour decisions of
households in the Shamva District of Zimbabwe.
The focus of the empirical work reported here is the
labour allocation decisions regarding off-farm work
of adult members of rural households. The analysis,
based on survey data on 1183 adults, investigates the

influence on those decisions of personal characteristics, household characteristics (such as household
composition) and exogenous factors (such as location).
The double hurdle model is chosen as the research
method as it allows the joint modelling of: (i) the decision whether or not to participate in the labour market;
and (ii) the amount of time the participant allocates to
off-farm work.
The layout of this paper is as follows. In Section 2,
a brief description of the theoretical context, based
on the agricultural household model, is presented.
Section 3 outlines the double hurdle model, the approach chosen for the empirical analysis. Section 4
introduces the dataset used, and the empirical findings are considered in Section 5. The paper concludes
with a discussion of policy implications.

2. The theoretical model

−

The popular rural household economic model (see,
for example, Singh et al., 1986; Sadoulet and de
Janvry, 1995) provides a theoretical basis for exploring labour supply decisions. Here, we adapt a version
suggested by Benjamin and Guyomard (1994). Assume for simplicity a two-person household which
seeks to maximise a utility function in leisure time
f
m
f
and household income, U(Lm
e , Le , Y ; E , E , H),
f denote the leisure time of the male
and
L
where Lm
e
e
and female household member, Em and Ef the vectors of their individual characteristics, such as human
capital, Y the household income, and H a vectors of
household characteristics. A household comprising
only one male and one female is chosen simply to
illustrate a multi-person household and should not
be taken as indicative of a typical household in the
study area. In fact, within the sample, there are farmers (mostly female) with absentee spouses, farmers
with children but no spouses, households headed by
children or young adults, and other household types.
The household faces the following constraints:
j

j

j

T j = Li + Lo + Le
j

Li ≥ 0,
Y

j

Lo ≥ 0,

where Li denotes labour time spent on the farm, Lo
the labour time off-farm, and each member has a fixed
availability of time, T j . Household income, Y, is related to: (i) the restricted conditional profit function
(π), which in turn depends on the price of agricultural
output (p), variable input prices (v), on-farm labour
j
of household members (Li ,) and their individual atj
tributes (E ), household characteristics (H), and other
fixed farm inputs (A), such as land; (ii) off-farm inj
come, comprising off-farm work time (Lo ), valued at
j
the respective wage rate (wo ); and (iii) remittances (R).
Assuming the usual regularity properties for the
profit and utility functions, an optimum allocation of
household time can be derived. Given our focus on
off-farm work, it is convenient to further assume an
j
interior solution for all choices except Lo . Then, the
necessary conditions for a maximum are:

(j = m, f),

where λj denotes the Lagrange multipliers associated
with positivity constraints on off-farm work.
Eq. (4) indicates that the marginal rate of substitution of on-farm family labour for money income
should be equated to the shadow price of that labour. If
the household member works off-farm, Eq. (5) states
that the marginal rate of substitution of off-farm work
for income should equal the market wage rate. If the
marginal rate of substitution of off-farm work for income exceeds the off-farm wage rate, the household
member does not work off farm.
For an individual household member, the decision
whether or not to participate in off-farm employment
will depend on a comparison of the market wage rate
j
and the individual’s reservation wage, wr , such that:
j

Lo = 0,

(j = m, f),

The reservation wage is an endogenous variable,
which will depend on the other exogenous variables in

I. Matshe, T. Young / Agricultural Economics 30 (2004) 175–186

the model (output and input prices, fixed farm factors,
individual and household characteristics). Variables
that raise the reservation wage reduce the probability
of participation, while variables that raise the market
wage rate, increase the probability of seeking off-farm
employment.

3. The statistical model
The study is based on micro-level data collected
over a relatively short survey period. As is typical
of such data, some households and some individuals
within households have no observed labour time allocated to some household activities. This poses a problem for the researcher, as standard regression analysis
can be misleading in these circumstances. Zero observations on off-farm labour time may arise for a number of reasons. An individual may not be a participant
in the labour market, because of personal preferences,
inadequate qualifications or other disability. Alternatively, some individuals may be participants (potential
workers) who chose not to work at the current level
of economic incentives.1
One approach would be to use the well-known Tobit model.2 However, a disadvantage of that model
is that all zero observations on hours worked are interpreted as corner solutions, i.e. the individual is assumed to be a participant in the labour market who
chooses not to work at the current level of exogenous
variables, such as wages. A further restriction of the
Tobit is that both the decision to participate and the
amount of hours allocated to an activity given participation are determined by the same variables, and that
a variable that increases the probability of participation also increases the number of hours worked. Thus,
for example, the possibility that an individual’s edu1 A third possibility is that, due to other household commitments,
off-farm work may be undertaken only on an infrequent basis and
the survey is conducted at a time when no off-farm work was
sought. However, given the survey design and the timing of our
survey, this is unlikely to arise in our study and is not investigated
here.
2 Some recent studies have modelled the participation decision
in isolation and estimated a Probit model (e.g. Lanjouw, 2001;
Ferreira and Lanjouw, 2001) or a Logit model (e.g. Ruben and Van
den Berg, 2001). These studies ignore the potentially important
‘hours of work’ decision.

177

cation has a strong positive impact on the decision to
work off farm but a negligible or even negative effect
on the number of hours worked would be precluded.
An alternative is to model as two separate decisions: (i) whether or not to participate in the labour
market; and (ii) the amount of time the participant
allocates to off-farm work. The reasons for separating
these decisions are twofold. First, due to social or
psychological drives, the individual may prefer not
to engage in off-farm work whatever the values of
exogenous variables. Second, an individual may be a
potential participant in the off-farm labour market but
for certain levels of relevant variables, decide not to
work off-farm. The former represents abstention, the
latter a corner solution.
One widely used approach in this context is
Heckman’s sample selection model (Heckman, 1979),
which is designed to account for the fact that the observed sample may be non-random. A Probit model
for the participation or ‘selection’ equation is estimated and a regression model, which is corrected
for selectivity bias,3 is specified to account for the
level of activity. Although preferable to the Tobit,
this approach is still restrictive.4 None of the zero
observations are due to a corner solution in the hours
of work equation. If a variable affects the hours of
work, it cannot sequentially lead to reduced and then
zero hours worked, although if it appears in the participation equation, it may have that effect (Ghadim
et al., 1999).
The double hurdle model, developed initially by
Cragg (1971), offers a more general approach to modelling participation and hours worked as two separate
decisions. The approach has been widely adopted in
the consumer demand literature (Atkinson et al., 1984;
Garcia and Labeaga, 1996; Jones, 1989; Blaylock and
Blissard, 1992; Burton et al., 2000) and the agricultural
technology adoption literature (Coady, 1995; Ghadim
et al., 1999). Although it has also been used to study
labour supply decisions (e.g. Blundell et al., 1987), it
has not been applied, to our knowledge, in any study
3 Specifically, the estimated inverse Mills ratio, derived from
the Probit results, is used as an additional regressor in the OLS
equation.
4 Johnston and DiNardo (1997, Section 13.12.2) also caution
that the Heckman approach is sensitive to violations of underlying
assumptions.

178

of labour decisions of rural agricultural smallholders
in developing countries.
In the double hurdle model, if we observe hours of
work a two-stage process must have been completed.
First, the individual has decided to participate in the
labour market, and second, has allocated some amount
of time to off-farm work. The corollary is that no work
time may be observed either because of the participation decision or the hours of work decision. It may be
presumed that for each decision the individual weighs
up the utility difference of each course of action but
as these calculations cannot be observed directly, the
model operates by assuming the existence of two latent variables: y1∗∗ , associated with the individual’s decision to participate in the off-farm labour market, and
y2∗∗ , associated with the decision of how many hours
to work off farm. These are linear functions of the first
and second hurdle regressors, x1 and x2 , respectively:
y1∗∗ = x1 β1 + u1 ,

(8)

y2∗∗ = x2 β2 + u2 .

(9)

Thus, x1 represents those variables used to explain the
participation decision and x2 represents those variables
used to explain the hours of work decision. If we denote an (unobservable) index variable as y1∗ = 1, if
the individual decides to participate, and y1∗ = 0, otherwise, then:
y1∗ = 1,

y1∗∗ > 0,

if

and
y1∗ = 0,

otherwise.

If it is assumed that the error term u1 is normally distributed, the first hurdle corresponds to a Probit model.
Turning to the hours of work equation, conditional
upon clearing the first hurdle, off-farm labour, y2∗ , is
generated as:
y2∗ = y2∗∗ ,

if

y2∗∗ > 0,

and
y2∗ = 0,

otherwise,

i.e. the second hurdle takes the form of a Tobit model,
and is capable of generating zero levels of off-farm
labour, independent of the first hurdle.

The observed hours of work, y, is determined by
the interaction of both hurdles:
y = y1∗ y2∗ .

(10)

Thus, if we observe an individual working off-farm,
he/she must be both a participant in the market, and
have decided on a positive level of work time. Zero
hours of off-farm work can be generated by a ‘failure’
at either or both of the hurdles.
It is further assumed that the latent variables have
a bivariate normal distribution:
1 ρσ
(u1 , u2 ) ∼ BVN(0, Σ), Σ =
.
(11)
ρσ σ 2
As Blaylock and Blissard (1992) point out, this general model nests a number of other formulations. For
example, when ρ is restricted to being equal to zero
the model collapses to the independent Cragg model.5
The Tobit model is nested within the independent double hurdle model (ρ = 0) when it is further assumed
that the probability of participation is 1.
4. Data
The survey that generated the dataset used in
this study was conducted over 34 weeks during
the 1996–1997 crop year as part of a project on
meso-scale rural market changes in the Shamva District of Zimbabwe. The district is divided into 24
wards, of which 13 are located in communal areas
and 6 in resettlement areas. The sample, representing
10% of the total number of households in the area,
was drawn from across the district in an attempt to
capture a wide range of socio-economic and geographical conditions. The data are based on a very
short recall period and most of the responses were,
wherever possible, verified. The survey was designed
to gather data on a wide range of issues including a
comprehensive study of the household economy.
The focus here is on individual adult members of the
household and on how each decides, firstly, whether
to participate in the off-farm labour market and, secondly, on the hours allocated to work away from the
family farm. The dataset contains information on all
5 The independent Cragg model assumes a feedback effect from
the level of possible allocations to the participation decision (see
Atkinson et al., 1984; Haines et al., 1988).

I. Matshe, T. Young / Agricultural Economics 30 (2004) 175–186

individuals whether they undertook off-farm work or
not. The questions on off-farm labour allocation were
two-fold: (i) do you work off-farm? and (ii) if so, how
much time did you allocate this week for this activity?
All members who had non-zero allocation of off-farm
labour time were then observed working off farm to
verify their responses.
An immediate problem in implementing the theoretical model with the sample data is the absence of reliable information on individuals’ wage rates. As other
studies (e.g. Adams, 1991) have shown, there are vibrant labour markets in one form or another in rural
areas throughout most of rural Zimbabwe. However,
the local economy in the Shamva District, while offering diverse income-generating opportunities, is characterised by a relative scarcity of formal employment
and non-monetary payments for labour are common.
There is also the difficulty of calculating a shadow
wage rate for those individuals who did not work during the survey period. Furthermore, there are likely to
be measurement errors in recorded wage data due to
the unreliability of survey responses in this regard. In
line with other studies (e.g. Benjamin and Guyomard,
1994), we choose to include a set of exogenous variables, such as individual and household characteristics, which might affect an individual’s shadow price
of time and the reservation wage rate.
An additional problem arises because the theoretical model outlined in Section 2 suggests that the
individual’s labour decision depends on both his/her
attributes and those of the other household member.
This theoretical specification is quite easy to represent in empirical analysis of households comprising
a farmer and a spouse (see, for example, Benjamin
and Guyomard, 1994) but in our dataset there is a
variety of household types (farmers with an absentee
spouse or no spouse, households headed by children
or young adults, households with several adults and
so forth). It is not clear in this case how the characteristics of other household members can be represented
in modelling the labour decision of the individual
decision-maker. Although we experimented with alternative approaches,6 it was decided that the empir6 Specifically, including aggregate variables which would depict
the characteristics of other household members (total years of
schooling, gender ratio, etc.) did not improve the overall fit and, in
any case, the effects of these variables were difficult to interpret.

179

ical model should exclude other household members’
individual characteristics, so that the final specification incorporated the decision-maker’s own attributes
(age, gender, education), general household’s characteristics (ethnic group, numbers in various age
groups, etc.) and farm characteristics (area planted,
importance of cash crops, etc.).
All the variables used in this study together with
their definitions, means and standard deviations are
presented in Table 1. The dependent variables in the
two hurdles of the model are participation (participate) and hours worked off-farm (offhours). The individual characteristics included in the analysis are age,
gender and education (level of schooling). The latter
is included to represent human capital, which many
studies (e.g. Huffman, 1992; de Janvry and Sadoulet,
1997) suggest plays an important role in the labour
time allocation of agricultural households. The household is characterised by the ethnic group of the head
of household, the household’s composition, its productive assets and availability of credit, and the level
of remittances. The farm characteristics are the proportion of cash crops grown, the area planted and the
agricultural terms of trade. These household and farm
characteristics feature in a number of studies of labour
supply in developing countries. The dataset is completed with two locational variables, which are expected to influence the participation decision:7 the distance from commercial centres and the quality of the
infrastructure.
Several of the sample means in Table 1 are higher
than the corresponding national averages for rural areas in Zimbabwe. This can be explained partly by
the significantly higher agricultural potential of the
Shamva District compared to other locations and by
the fact that this district has a highly diversified economy thanks to its agricultural potential and significant
mineral wealth. However, since small-scale producers are located in pockets of poor and/or inaccessible land throughout the whole country regardless of
agro-climatic region, the demographic variables reflect
levels that are typical of rural areas in general. Mean
land area accessible to the household is close to the
national average. The effective area is about 1.9 acres

of transport infrastructure, mainly roads, in stimulating the growth
of non-farm employment in Latin America.

The closeness of the areas of arable land accessible
to the household in the district to the national average
is due to the uniform discriminatory policy (embodied in the Land Apportionment Act of 1930) that was
behind the formation of rural areas (native reserves)
across the country. In the sample period, a total of 302
households allocated some time off farm. This figure
includes all those households that undertook any activity that is primarily for purposes of the production
of goods and services for sale and formal and informal
employment.
All the other variable means are close to the corresponding national averages. The wide variations in
education levels, remittance income and assets reflect
the typical unequal distribution of these variables in
rural areas. The time worked is much higher than one

would expect. However, it is worth remembering that
these data were collected over the 34 busiest weeks of
the year. Time worked also falls within the range of
results for agricultural labour time allocation from a
study of small-holders by Massell and Johnson (1968).
When one considers that during this time of the year
it is quite possible that the labour week can be as long
as 6 days, these data do not appear unrealistic.

5. Results
The double hurdle model was estimated for all individual adult household members in the sample (1183
cases). The choice of explanatory variables to include
in each of the two hurdles is problematic (Atkinson
et al., 1984). As Ghadim et al. (1999) note, “It is
usually thought necessary to impose some exclusion
restrictions across the two vectors of explanatory vari-

I. Matshe, T. Young / Agricultural Economics 30 (2004) 175–186

ables in order to adequately identify the parameter
estimates. However, theory seldom allows one to be
precise as to which variables should appear in which
vector.” (p. 9). So the selection is inevitably somewhat
arbitrary. The approach taken here is to include in the
participation equation all those socio-economic characteristics which might determine preferences towards
work and which might proxy the reservation wage.
Table 2 presents the results of the joint maximum
likelihood estimation8 of the two equations of the independent double hurdle model explaining the probability of participation and hours of off-farm work. A
Tobit model version containing the same second stage
variables is also presented. On the basis of a likelihood
ratio (LR) test, the restrictions implied by the Tobit
model were rejected (LR = 315.95, with a critical
2 value of 30.14). The implication of this result is
χ19
that participation and hours of work decisions are not
based on the same decision-making process. The independent double hurdle is favoured because a LR test
of the significance of the covariance term (␳indicates
that the independent double hurdle model is appropriate (ρ=0, cannot be rejected on the basis of a LR test
statistic of 0.689, against the critical χ12 value of 3.84).
This implies that participation and hours of off-farm
work are distinct, unrelated decisions.
These results vindicate the choice of a two-stage
modelling approach to labour allocation, since it is
apparent that the effects of the explanatory variables
are more complicated than the Tobit regression would
imply. This is well illustrated by considering the variable denoting the gender of the individual. The double hurdle results suggest that a female member of the
household is less likely to work off farm but if she
does decide to undertake such work, she will work
longer hours than her male counterpart, ceteris paribus.
Hence, as the impact of gender on participation is opposite in direction to that on hours of work, drawing inferences about the effect of gender on off-farm
labour allocation from the Tobit or other single equation regression would lead to erroneous conclusions.
The variable coefficients presented in Table 2 can
be used to establish the magnitudes of the effects of
a change in an explanatory variable for the particular hurdle. In the participation equation, for example,
the interpretation of the variable coefficients is that
8

STATA 5 was used to obtain all econometric estimates.

181

each one-unit increase in a given variable leads to an
increase in the Probit index9 by standard deviations
equal to the magnitude of the coefficient. For example, a 1 acre increase in the actual area planted leads
to a decrease in the Probit index by 0.35917 standard
deviations.10
Variables for age and educational background are
included to capture the effect of age, experience and
formal training, characteristics which may be linked
to the shadow wage rate. The quadratic life-cycle effect on off-farm labour time is as expected: at young
ages, the hours of work increase with age, but at older
ages the hours worked decrease as age increases. In
terms of participation, however, the coefficient on age
is negative, but insignificant. The quadratic term in
age is positive and significant, suggesting for older
workers the probability of participation in the off-farm
labour market increases with age. This is a somewhat
surprising result in terms of much of the literature
(see, for example, Benjamin and Guyomard, 1994;
Abdulai and Delgado, 1999), although Ruben and Van
den Berg, 2001), obtain a similar result for off-farm
self-employment in Honduras. As has been found in
other studies (e.g. Ferreira and Lanjouw, 2001), the
probability of engaging in off-farm activities is positively and significantly related to the level of education. Specifically, an individual educated beyond 14
years is found to be more likely to work off farm. Thus,
the hypothesis that years of formal education make
members more employable (for example, because they
would be more knowledgeable of employment opportunities and more adaptable in the range of tasks that
they can perform as a hired worker or self-employed)
is confirmed by these results. However, education does
not significantly affect the hours worked in off-farm
employment.
Female adults are less likely to participate in
off-farm work. This may not only reflect the greater
time commitments of women within the household,
but also the significant gender biases in labour time
allocation in this area, a result which would be in

normal with mean zero and variance 1, then xi b is the Probit index.

one to think in the so-called Z-metric, which is a way of interpreting
the changes in standard deviations.

line with numerous studies in similar communities.11
Those women who do work off-farm are most often
to be found in low paid, low productivity occupations. Further evidence that domestic commitments
11 Several studies are based on gender-disaggregated data (e.g.
Amin and Chipika, 1993; Abdulai and Delgado, 1999). Disaggregation along gender lines between and within households can
better explain labour allocation behaviour because, it is hypothesised, the way males and females between and within households
behave is different.

are an important determinant of female participation
is provided by the negative, significant coefficient on
the interaction of gender and the number of infants
in the household: females in households with young
children are less likely to engage in the off-farm
labour market. As noted earlier, when women do participate in the labour market, they work more hours
off-farm than their male counterparts, but again this
response is tempered when there are infants in the
household.

I. Matshe, T. Young / Agricultural Economics 30 (2004) 175–186

Turning to household characteristics, the number of
adults in the household increases the household’s capacity for diversifying its income-generating activities
and so it is unsurprising that the larger the number
of adults the greater the probability of an individual
adult participating in off-farm work and the longer
the hours worked. On the other hand, the presence
of children per se has no significant effect on labour
time allocation to off-farm work. This finding concurs
with results from other studies in rural areas in developing countries that child-rearing and off-farm work
are not necessarily competing activities (Sahn and
Alderman, 1993; Skoufias, 1994). In these rural communities, members of the extended family take care
of children in the absence of the parents. However, as
we have already seen, the presence of infants does affect the off-farm labour decisions of female adults in
the household.
The ethnicity of the household head is another
household characteristic which has a significant impact on the participation decision. This variable may
influence preferences for off-farm work or may reflect biases in this labour market. Here we find that
individual members from households of Zezuru extraction are less likely to participate in off-farm work,
contrary to expectations.
Unearned income in the form of remittances has a
negative effect on both the likelihood of participation
and on the hours worked. By easing the constraint
on household income, remittance income reduces the
need to undertake off-farm work. Productive assets,
which are mostly agricultural, together with land area,
can be seen as proxies for socio-economic group or
wealth. Members of households which are relatively
well-off are more likely to participate in off-farm work
but when they do, they spend relatively less time in
this activity. The other indicator of financial status in
the model, credit availability, is not found to affect the
participation decision.
The farming system adopted by the household is
represented in the model by the proportion of cash
crops in the crop mix. Not surprisingly this variable
negatively affects participation in off-farm work. This
result suggests that households who grow cash crops
tend to generate cash income for market purchases
from this source rather than off-farm work. This result might also reflect the fact that most cash crops
grown in this area tend to be labour intensive. This fact,

183

coupled with the other demands for household labour
within the family, increases the reservation wage of
this labour. Another farm characteristic which has a
significant impact on labour decisions is the size of
arable land available to the household: the larger the
area the less likely is participation in off-farm work
and the less time devoted to it by those who choose
to participate. This is consistent with farmers undertaking off-farm work because of constraints in getting
access to arable land, which in turn may lower their
reservation wage for such work.
Farmers in Shamva are sensitive to relative prices
of farm and non-farm products, but only the hours of
work decision is significantly affected, i.e. an increase
in the level of agricultural product prices relative to
non-agricultural ones leads to less time being allocated
off-farm.
Although both of the locational variables (denoting
the quality of the infrastructure and the distance from
commercial markets) have the expected estimated impact on participation, neither is statistically significant.
Admittedly, the measure of infrastructure quality, a
simple dummy variable, is rather crude. That distance
does not have a more significant effect may reflect
the fact that off-farm work has been defined in this
study to include all forms of paid employment and
that local labour markets offer adequate opportunities
of employment in one form or another. Moreover, as
the terms of trade are closely related to distance to
the nearest centre, multicollinearity may be influencing the precision of estimation of their respective coefficients.
Finally, we may note that the overall fit is
satisfactory12 both in terms of R2 (0.37) and the estimated model’s predictive ability (Table 3). Of the
1183 adults in the sample, 559 worked off-farm.
The model correctly predicts 466 (83%) of these observations, while the remaining 93 individuals were
predicted not to clear the first hurdle. Of the 624 individuals in the sample who did not work off-farm,
550 individuals (88%) were correctly predicted not to
allocate any time off-farm (373 were predicted to fail
at the first hurdle, 116 to fail to clear both hurdles and

However, the model fails to correctly predict the behaviour of 74 individuals (12%), who were observed
not allocating any time off the farm but who were
predicted by the model to clear both hurdles and so
record some time in off-farm activities.

6. Discussion
The use of the double hurdle approach to modelling
labour decisions in this context has been justified. Not
only was the Tobit model formally rejected by the data,
but some variables, such as productive assets, had a
different qualitative as well as quantitative impact at
each decision stage. A single equation approach such
as the Tobit would have conflated these effects and
given misleading results.
Nevertheless, the analysis has a number of shortcomings which should be borne in mind when considering the policy implications discussed below. First,
the lack of reliable data on wages precludes using potentially one of the most powerful economic variables
in the model and one of the main variables that is
traditionally a target for policy in this sub-region. It
would have been instructive to explore whether their
role is important for rural small-holders in Shamva
and whether policy measures to address low wages in
these areas are appropriate.
Second, this approach implicitly assumes uncontrolled ‘expenditure of time’. If an individual with the
requisite characteristics is willing to work, it is assumed he or she will work, i.e. paid work will be found
or time will be allocated to an activity that produces
goods and services primarily for sale. This is clearly
not the case. There are limits as to the availability of

work and it would have been informative if these limits could have been included within the model. However, although variables such as the unemployment
rate in each locality or the density of the population
in a particular village or ward could have been built
into the model, in a cross-section study these variables
would exhibit relatively little variation and they would
merely pick up the effect of location.
Finally, this analysis ignores a number of potentially important factors. The riskiness and periodicity
of agricultural production (Matshe, 1997), inter-year
variations and seasonal constraints on grain and cash
holdings can have implications for the amount of time
allocated to different activities and for pluriactivity.
However, it is difficult or impossible to incorporate
these factors in a single season cross-section study.
Health considerations also may have influenced the
results. At the time of the survey, the stigma attached
to HIV/AIDS made it impossible to get meaningful
explanations for some apparently inconsistent observations (such as no off-farm participation even though
the characteristics of the household and those of the
individual would have suggested otherwise). Another
consideration to be borne in mind when assessing
these results is that the survey was conducted during a transitional phase of economic reform, from a
heavily centralised economic system to a more liberal
and market-oriented one. Specifically, the government
had just abolished the centralised marketing of most
grains, had relaxed laws governing the mining of small
mineral deposits, had shifted most of the management
of local authorities to the local community through
elected District Councils, had abolished the licensing
of agricultural produce marketing and generally was
implementing measures consistent with the Structural
Adjustment Programme.
6.1. Implications for rural development policy
Increasing off-farm work in rural areas is important because of the potential it has to ameliorate the
effects of low agricultural productivity and low agricultural incomes which are associated with poverty
in rural areas. Government policy should be directed
not just at agricultural development but to promoting
the rural economy as a whole. This entails policies
directed towards providing incentives that encourage
households to participate in rural non-farm activities,

I. Matshe, T. Young / Agricultural Economics 30 (2004) 175–186

as well as increasing the capacity of households to
respond to such incentives (Reardon et al., 2001). In
this regard, there is particular scope to promote manufacturing, commerce and services which link to the
needs of modern agriculture.
Our results suggest that in the Shamva District, the
main factors influencing labour allocation off farm are
land accessibility, asset holding, education and gender. The government’s current policy of redistributive
land reform would relieve the land constraint on the
allocation of labour to farm work and would, according to our results, reduce the incentive to participate in
the off-farm labour market. This may see household
labour being drawn back on to the farm and may discourage rural–urban drift, but in the absence of other
measures to encourage agricultural development (including technology promotion, enhanced human resources, etc.), the impact on rural household incomes
will be muted.
Rural households with productive assets have the
capacity to diversify into off-farm employment and the
higher the level of assets the more likely they are to engage in these off-farm activities. The government policy of subsidising draught livestock through restocking schemes (and in some areas actually restocking
depleted herds) and the subsidised provision of agricultural implements for rent is thus expected to release
some household members for work off farm. On the
other hand, our results suggest that increasing household assets reduces the amount of time spent off farm.
This throws into sharp focus the difficulty of drawing
ready conclusions about the effect on rural incomes of
the exogenous provision of assets to rural households.
As the level of education is strongly and positively
linked to participation in the off-farm labour market,
skill-building and training of human resources is an
essential aspect of promoting both agricultural development and rural off-farm employment. Moreover,
policies and programmes to facilitate rural women’s
access to the off-farm labour market are called for,
if the current gender bias in labour markets is to be
reversed.

185

a two-stage (double hurdle) process, which distinguishes the participation decision and the hours of
work decision. This provides a more realistic model of
the labour market. In particular, it avoids the assumptions that all non-participants do not want to work and
that the same factors influence the participation and
work-time decisions in the same directions. The approach is vindicated by the data, with the single equation, Tobit model being clearly rejected, and some
variables (e.g. assets and gender) having qualitatively
and quantitatively different effects on the two labour
allocation decisions.
Our results confirm that education and gender
are important individual characteristics determining
labour allocation off farm. Farm/household characteristics (the number of adults in the household, the
level of remittances, the area accessible to the household and its level of asset-holding) are also significant
factors in off-farm work time allocation. In the study
area, off-farm work is stimulated at least in part by the
inability of household to increase agricultural output
and therefore agricultural income.
Given the importance of non-farm income in alleviating the problems of low agricultural productivity,
poverty and food insecurity, policies should be directed towards providing incentives to households
to participate in rural non-farm activities, as well as
increasing their capacity to take advantage of such
opportunities. This would entail an approach in which
the rural economy is viewed as a whole, so that, in
addition to policies aimed at agricultural development, manufactures, commerce and services essential
for modern agriculture are also promoted.
