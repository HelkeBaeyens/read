Abstract
Maize (Zea mays L.) is the most important cereal crop in the hills of Nepal, where the grain is used for human consumption
and the stover for animal fodder. Maize farms are small, and population pressure necessitates the intensification of existing
farming systems. Maize research directed at developing technologies for maize production began in Nepal in 1965. In 2000,
a survey was carried out in two districts to determine the current level of adoption of improved maize production practices. In
each of these districts, remote and accessible village development committees (VDCs) were surveyed. Questionnaires were
administered to 54 randomly selected households in each VDC. A Tobit analysis was used to determine socio-economic,
physical and technology factors that influence the use of improved varieties by farmers. All households use composted
farmyard manure, and in the more accessible areas, urea as part of their soil fertility management strategy. Use of improved
varieties was less than 60% for all VDCs and only 15% in the most remote VDC. In three of the four VDCs, adoption of
improved varieties primarily occurred during the past 5 years. Based on a Tobit analysis, Khet land area, ethnic group, years of
fertiliser use, off-farm income, and contact with extension significantly and positively affected adoption of improved varieties.
Farmers in VDCs in central Nepal reported lack of seed to be the major constraint to the adoption of improved varieties,
while lack of knowledge of new varieties was the major constraint for farmers in the western VDCs. The results from this
survey suggest that the strategy for improving the adoption of new varieties will differ depending on infrastructure and the
socio-economic conditions of the farmers in a given area.

1. Introduction

Agriculture dominates the economy of Nepal, accounting for 80% of the work force and 40% of the
GDP. Although Nepal is most famous for its high
mountains, there are some 3.2 million ha of cereals
grown in the lowlands in the south of the country

(the Terai), on the valley floors, and on the terraced
hillsides below 3000 m elevation. Agriculture is more
commercialised in the Terai, where the road system
and markets are fairly well developed compared to
the hill region. The Terai provides most of the food
needed in the urban centres of the country. Though
the agriculture systems in the hills have been less dynamic than those in the Terai, they are of critical importance to Nepal's food security. Approximately 50%
of Nepal's population lives in the hills. Due to the
limited road networks, combined with the remoteness
of most villages from established urban centres, the
difficulties of transporting food, and the lack of other

cash-generating enterprises, food security in these regions is largely dependent on farm produce. Maize is
the most important cereal grown in the hills, where
about 75% of the country's 800,000ha of maize are
located (Paudyal and Poudel, 2001).
In the hills, maize is cultivated on sloping terraced
fields called Bari land. It is generally planted during
pre-monsoon rains and harvested prior to the end of
the monsoons. In the eastern two-thirds of the country, finger millet is often relayed onto the maturing
maize crop, while in the western third, maize is rotated with a winter wheat crop. The rate of growth
in maize production has been less than 1% per year
over the past 20 years. Average maize yields during
1970-1984 declined from 1900 to 1400kg/ha, probably due to the expansion of maize into marginal land.
Since 1984, however, yields have improved to around
1800kg/ha (Adhikary et al., 2001). There is currently
little scope for the expansion of maize area in the hills,
as most non-cropped land is either too steep for sustainable production or is protected forest. In order to
just keep pace with the population growth rate of 2.3%
(CIMMYT, 1999), a significant increase in the productivity and production of maize is needed. This increase
will be dependent upon the development and adoption
of new varieties and crop management practices.
Maize research in Nepal was first undertaken in an
organised way in 1965 (Paudyal and Poudel, 2001).
Since then, 15 improved open-pollinated varieties
(OPVs) have been released by the national research
system for the various ecologies of the country, however, farmers commonly grow only five of these
(Adhikary et al., 2001). Movement of improved OPVs
has been constrained by the lack of active seed enterprise in the country. The National Maize Research
Program produces about 200,000 kg of foundation
seed, which is distributed to farmers, the Department
of Agriculture, and small seed producers (Adhikary
et al., 2001). There are no formal enterprises producing certified seed. The actual amount of certified
seed that enters the market is not known, but the area
sown with improved seed, including hybrids from
India that are grown mainly in the Terai and seed of
improved varieties that have been recycled for one or
more seasons, is estimated to be between 54 and 58%
(Adhikary et al., 2001; Aquino et al., 2001).
Most farmers in the hills do not have ready access
to inputs or information. Villages tend to be isolated

from one another by forests, steep ridges, or rivers
and streams, and there are few roads suitable for vehicles, only paths between villages. Purchased goods
must be carried by a porter or, on a more limited
scale, by mules. Due to the remoteness of most hill
villages from established urban centres, and the distance between villages in terms of travelling time, the
logistics of running an effective extension program are
formidable. For these reasons, the movement of technology is much slower in the hills than in the Terai.
The objectives of this study were to determine the
rate of adoption of improved OPVs in two hill districts of Nepal and to investigate factors affecting their
adoption.

2. Methodology
The data reported here were collected as part of a
large survey carried out with support from the Hill
Maize Research Project (HMRP) to establish a baseline for quantifying the project's impact in the future.
The survey was conducted within two Village Development Committees (VDCs) of Dailekh district in the
mid-Western development region and in two VDCs
of Dolakha district in the central development region.
Dailekh and Dolakha were selected because they contain agricultural research stations that are active in
the HMRP. Furthermore, there is relatively little published information on the adoption of improved technologies in these two districts. The two districts differ
in their level of development. Dailekh lies within the
mid-Western development region which is considered
to be less developed and have more poverty than other
regions within Nepal (Paudyal et al., 2001). Based on
discussions with district officers, one accessible and
one remote VDC was selected from within each district surveyed.
A random sample of farmers within each VDC was
selected from a voter's list that had been updated with
the help of VDC officials, or when this list was not
available from a list of farmers within a ward provided by the ward chairman. Fifty-four households
were interviewed in each VDC and the total sample
size was 216. The survey consisted of a questionnaire
administered by trained research staff. Only 206 of the
questionnaires were completed and used in the analysis. Means for various physical and socio-economic

J.K. Ransom et al./ Agricultural Economics 29 (2003) 299-305

features were calculated for each VDC. For quantitative data, analyses of variance using a completely random model with VDC as the dependent variable were
performed.
To estimate the effects of various quantitative and
qualitative factors on the extent of improved OPV use,
a Tobit model was used on the combined data. The
Tobit model is a censored normal regression model.
Its estimation is related to the estimation of a censored
and truncated normal distribution (Amemiya, 1973;
McDonald and Moffit, 1980). In this study, the Tobit
model was used to estimate the parameters of the adoption of improved OPV maize by farmers in Dolakha
and Dailekh districts in the mid-hills of Nepal. The
function is estimated from a censored sample where
the sample population consists of both adopters and
non-adopters of improved maize varieties.
The empirical model of the effect of a set of explanatory variables on the adoption of improved maize
varieties is specified using the following linear relationship:

+ fJ1 X 1 + fJ2X2 + {J3X3 + f34X4 + fJsXs
+ fJ6X6 + f37X7 + fJsXs + f39X9 + fJwXw
+ fJuXu + fJ12X12 + f313X13 + e,

A= fJo

where A is the percentage of farmer's total maize
area planted to improved OPVs, fJo the constant, Xt
the area of Khet land owned by farmer (ha), X2 the
area of Bari land owned by farmer (ha), X3 the average size of plots farmed (ha), x4 the off-farm income
(Rs. 1000 per year), X5 the literate head of household
(dummy; 1: literate; 0: illiterate), x6 the age of household head (years), X7 the district (dummy; 1: Dolakha;
0: Dailekh), Xs the contact with extension (dummy;
1: yes; 0: no), x9 the hired farm labour for maize production (dummy; 1: yes; 0: no), Xw the distance to
market (dummy; 1: :::Skm; 0: .::;5km), Xu the caste
(dummy; 1: Brahman, Chetri and Thakari; 0: others),
X 12 the years of fertiliser use, and e the error term.
The coefficients of the regression model were estimated by applying the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) technique.
Khet land is used for rice cultivation. This variable
was included in the model because farmers with more
Khet land tend to be better connected to markets, use
more inputs, and therefore may have better access to
information and seed. Variables Bari area and aver-

301

age plot size were included because farmers with less
area for maize production are under more pressure to
intensify, and therefore potentially have more incentive to adopt new technology. Income from grain sales
indicates a connection with markets and an increased
incentive to produce more cereals on farm. Age of
household head, literacy and caste are all important
because they are socio-economic factors thought to influence access to information. The variable years of
fertiliser use was included because of the assumption
that the adoption of one technology may predispose
the farmer to adopt other technologies. District, contact with extension, and distance from markets were
included because infrastructure and availability of information were thought to likely affect the availability
of and demand for seed.

3. Results and discussion
Namdu and Kalbhairab VDCs were selected for
the survey from Dolakha and Dailekh districts, respectively, based on their relative accessibility. Maga
Pauwa and Chauratha were selected because they were
considered to be relatively remote. Based on the survey
results, however, market access was significantly lower
in Dailekh than in Dolakha, and the average distance
to markets where inputs are purchased was considerably greater for both categories of VDCs (Table 1).
Overall, farmers in Chauratha were the furthest from
input markets, averaging 19 km. Since this distance
was based on farmers' responses and not on a direct
measurement, it may not be very accurate, however, it
is still useful for comparing relative distances between
VDCs. The distance to the input market in the relatively remote VDC of Dolakha was similar to that of
the relatively accessible VDC in Dailekh, indicating
that the road infrastructure in Dailekh is far inferior to
that of Dolakha. Contact with extension was inversely
related to the distance to market, though it was poor
even in the most accessible VDC (Table 1). Literacy
rates tended to be higher in the VDCs in Dolakha
than those in Dailekh, while farm and household sizes
tended to be smaller (Table 1). The maize area was
similar across VDCs and averaged only about 0.3 ha.
Farmers in Dailekh sold substantially more maize than
farmers in Dolakha, though the highest maize grain
sales reported in Chauratha, was only 29 kg per year.

This suggests that very little of the maize produced
leaves the farm for commercial purposes.
The application of farmyard manure (FYM) is the
traditional and dominant method for maintaining soil
fertility used by farmers in the hills. All farmers surveyed in all VDCs applied FYM (Table 2). Average
rates varied between 7000 and 8000 kg/ha and did not
differ significantly between VDCs. The percentage of
farmers using fertiliser was high in all VDCs except
Chauratha. The amount applied was generally low relative to the recommended rate (Pandey, 2000), particularly in Chauratha, where only 6 kg/haN was applied

on average (Table 2). There was almost no application
of P fertilisers in all four VDCs.
With the exception of Namdu, where 59% of farmers used improved OPVs, less than 30% of farmers
used improved varieties (Table 2). Except for Namdu,
adoption rates were much lower than the national rate
estimated by Adhikary et al. (2001) and Aquino et al.
(2001). This suggests that adoption rates are much
higher in districts not surveyed or that the national
estimates are higher than actual rates. The higher
adoption rates in Namdu may have been related to
the dissemination of information and seed from the

Kabre agricultural research station which is located
nearby and has been active for more than 20 years.
The rate of adoption of improved OPVs was significantly less than the rate of fertiliser adoption. This
is somewhat surprising given the relatively higher
cost of fertiliser compared to seed, and the additional
difficulty of transporting bulky fertiliser. Improved
open-pollinated yields were higher (on average by
17% ), which clearly indicates the advantage of growing improved varieties. Generally yields were higher
in Dailekh than in Dolakha (Table 2).
The time of initial adoption of improved OPVs differed between Namdu, which had the highest adoption

level, and the other VDCs. In Namdu, most adoption
occurred 5 or more years previous to the study, with
almost half of the adoption occurring more than 10
years previously (Table 3). In the remaining VDCs,
however, the limited adoption that had occurred took
place 5 or fewer years previous to the study.
Based on the Tobit analysis, which combined data
from all of the VDCs, the variables that significantly
increased the adoption of improved OPVs were area
of Khet land, ethnic group, years of fertiliser use,
off-farm income, and contact with extension (Table 4).
Hired labour was the only variable that had a significantly negative influence on the use of improved

OPVs. Of the factors that significantly impacted on
the adoption of improved OPV s, Khet area and ethnic
group were determined to be important, but also unable to be managed or externally influenced. Farmers
with more Khet land tend to be better connected to
markets because rice is more often sold or traded than
maize. The negative effect of hired labour was determined to be quite large. The use of non-household
labour in maize production is dependent on a number
of factors, e.g. the distance of the maize field from the
homestead or the amount of labour required relative
to available labour. Farmers who do not hire labour
for maize production (i.e., those who have sufficient
family labour) are more likely to adopt improved OPV
maize than those who hire labour. This is probably
because more labour is used per unit of land for cultivating improved OPV maize compared to local maize.
Of the remaining factors included in the model, contact with extension had the most dramatic influence
on adoption (Table 4). This indicates that information,
and not just seed availability, currently constrains the
use of improved OPVs. Years of fertiliser use had a
minor positive impact on the rate of adoption. This
may indicate that farmers who have more experience
with technologies in general are more likely to test
and adopt new OPVs. Off-farm income had a positive effect on adoption, but the data suggest that large
changes in off-farm income are needed to create significant increases in adoption of improved OPVs. It
is likely that farmers with large off-farm income have
one or more family members working outside of the
village. Not only would the increased cash allow the
family to purchase inputs, but also the individuals
working outside the village would have the opportunity to acquire seed and information on new varieties
from other areas.

To evaluate the effects of each independent variable
on the adoption of improved maize varieties, marginal
effects were estimated (Table 4). It can be seen that
the same set of independent variables used in the primary index function show a significant effect on the
adoption of improved maize.
The marginal effect of 13.5 for Khet land area
implies that overall respondents, every 1 ha increase
in Khet land area would increase the adoption of
improved maize varieties by 13.5%. Similarly, every
1000 Rs. increase in off-farm income would increase
the adoption of improved OPV maize by 0.2%, and
every 1 year of experience in fertiliser application
would increase adoption of improved OPV maize
by 1.0%. Among the dummy variables, the largest
change of 24.9% is associated with ethnicity and the
second largest of 23.0% is due to contact with extension personnel. The results also suggests that adoption
of improved OPV maize will be reduced by 18.76%,
if farmers need to hire labour for maize cultivation.
The primary reasons given by farmers for not adopting improved OPVs differed between the two districts.
In both VDCs in Dolakha, the lack of seed availability was the primary reason for not growing improved
OPVs, while in the VDCs of Dailekh, the lack of
knowledge of improved OPVs constrained their adoption (Table 5). These data do not support the commonly repeated notion that farmers do not grow improved OPVs because these varieties are not as good
as those they currently grow. In fact, the data suggest
that very few farmers have had a chance to evaluate
the improved OPVs currently available. The data indicate that improved OPVs have a significant yield advantage over local varieties in all VDCs, though the
magnitude varied somewhat between VDCs (Table 2).
Perhaps in some cases (i.e., in Chauratha), the lack of

J.K. Ransom et al. I Agricultural Economics 29 (2003) 299-305

adoption could be due to the perceived advantage of
improved OPVs being insufficient to motivate change.
Since higher yielding, better-adapted varieties could
be a significant incentive for farmers to adopt new varieties, a more concerted effort in the development of
the varieties is justi tied.

4. Conclusions
A number of conclusions can be drawn from these
data regarding the adoption of improved OPVs in
Nepal. Since adoption of fertiliser is higher than the
adoption improved seed-the relatively cheaper, more
transportable input, the poor adoption of seed cannot
be blamed on 'remoteness' per se. Perhaps, the most
conspicuous finding of this research is the very limited exposure that farmers have had to new production
technologies. This deficiency must be immediately
addressed if improvement in production and productivity are to occur. Our analysis clearly indicates that
there has been limited contact between farmers and the
extension system in its broadest sense (including the
non-governmental community active in agricultural
development). Greater emphasis on exposing farmers
to new improved OPVs is urgently needed as a first
step in improving adoption. The data also suggest that
the strategy for improving adoption of new technologies in accessible areas may be quite different to that
used in remote areas. It appears that information is
more constraining in remote districts than in accessible
districts-in these areas seed constrains adoption. This
would suggest that in the inaccessible areas, a program
of more intensive on-farm demonstrations and testing
is immediately justifiable. On the other hand, actions
in accessible districts should focus on improving
the availability of improved seed. Community-based
seed production programs should be supported until commercial seed enterprises develop to fill the
current void. The reported 17% yield advantage of
improved OPV s, averaged overall VDCs, indicate
that significant increases in production and produc-

305

tivity can be achieved through the use of improved
varieties.
