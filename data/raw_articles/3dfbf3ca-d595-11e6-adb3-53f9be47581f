Abstract
Returns to investment in wheat breeding research in Nepal were estimated for two periods: (1) the Green
Revolution period (1960-1990), when modern semidwarf wheat varieties first appeared and spread throughout the
country, and (2) the post-Green Revolution period (after 1990), when first-generation modern varieties will be
replaced by newer materials. Major benefits of the Nepalese wheat breeding program have included maintenance of
disease resistance and faster dissemination of exotic germplasm. Attractive rates of return to investment in wheat
breeding have been due in part to Nepal's ability to capture spillover benefits from neighboring countries and from
international agricultural research centers.

1. Introduction

During the late 1960s and early 1970s, highyielding semidwarf wheats developed in Mexico
(referred to here as modern varieties, or MVs)
were introduced into a number of the world's
most populous developing countries. When grown
with increased levels of fertilizer and an assured
water supply, MVs performed significantly better
than older materials, making possible dramatic
increases in wheat production and higher incomes for the millions of farmers who adopted
the technology.
The highly visible production increases associated with the introduction of MVs for many years
ensured a steady flow of resources to national

wheat breeding programs. This situation changed
beginning in the late 1980s, when a combination
of economic and political factors reduced the
availability of funding for agricultural research.
As budgets ceased expanding in real terms, research administrators in many countries were
forced to pay greater attention to the efficiency
with which resources were being used. Research
priority-setting procedures were often amended
by the introduction of requirements that proposed research projects be subjected to formal
economic analysis, with the goal of generating
quantitative profitability measures to facilitate selection among alternative investment opportunities.
One country in which there is a need carefully
to assess the returns to wheat breeding research
is Nepal. Even though agriculture represents the
predominant sector in Nepal's economy, the
overall level of public-sector support to agricul-

tural research remains relatively low, averaging
only 0.08% of agricultural GDP during the past
two decades, as compared to 0.41 % for a group
of 92 developing countries (Pardey, Roseboom
and Anderson, 1991). Because Nepal's limited
research resources are used to support a wide
range of research activities, there is a need to
ensure that funds invested in the National Wheat
Research Program (NWRP) generate attractive
returns compared to alternative investment opportunities.
This paper reports the results of a recent study
carried out to estimate the returns to wheat
breeding research in Nepal. The study had two
main objectives: 0) to estimate the returns to
past investment in wheat breeding in Nepal, and
(2) to estimate the likely future returns to wheat
breeding in Nepal under a range of plausible
assumptions about key technical and economic
parameters. The primary goal of the study was to
generate information for use by Nepalese policy
makers and donors in deciding an appropriate
level of future funding for the national wheat
breeding program.
2. Estimating returns to agricultural research:
Conceptual issues
The rate of return to investment in agricultural
research is frequently estimated using the economic surplus approach, which posits that an
outward (downward) shift in the supply function
attributable to technological change leads to an
increase in the economic surplus accruing to producers and/or consumers. 1 Although early work
using the economic surplus approach was based
on simplistic assumptions about the supply and
demand functions, over time the procedures used
have been refined substantially. 2 Subsequent ex1 For useful reviews of the literature on evaluating returns to
investment in agricultural research, see Schuh and Tollini
(1978), Scobie (1978) and Norton and Davis (198l).
2 Progressive refinements of the basic method appear in
Griliches (1957, 1958), Peterson (1967), Schmitz and Seckler
(1970), Fishel (197l), Akino and Hayami (1975) Hayami and
Herdt (1977) Lindner and Jarrett (1968) Rose (1980) Wise
and Fell (1980) and Norton and Davis (198l).

tensions of the conceptual framework have made
clear that the size and distribution among producers and consumers of the increase in economic surplus depends upon the shapes of the
supply and demand curves, as well as the nature
of the supply curve shift - parallel, pivotal, or
convergent - resulting from technological change
(Voon and Edwards, 1991). Government price
policies have also been shown to be important in
determining the distribution of research benefits
(Alston, Freebairn and Edwards, 1988; Renkow,
1993).
3. Application to a plant breeding program
Following Brennan (1992) and Byerlee (990),
the economic surplus approach can be adapted to
a plant breeding program. First, the benefits of
the breeding program are estimated as follows:

Bt =

gY;At~

(1)

where B represents benefits from the breeding
program, g is percentage yield gain per period
attributable to the breeding program, Y yield, A
area affected by the breeding program, W price
of the commodity, and t period.
Next, the internal rate of return to the research investment is calculated as the value which
drives the discounted stream of costs and benefits
to 0:

E[(Bt-Ct)/(1+IRRf] =0

(2)

where IRR represents the internal rate of return,
B benefits from the breeding program, and C
cost of the breeding program.
This simplified approach, which uses the
change in the value of production attributable to
research as an approximation of the change in
economic surplus, has two underlying restrictive
assumptions. First, it implicitly assumes a perfectly elastic demand function, since research-induced shifts in the supply function do not result
in endogenous price changes. For a tradable commodity in an open economy (such as wheat in
Nepal), this is a reasonable assumption. Second,
it implicitly assumes a perfectly inelastic supply
function, so that an outward (implicitly parallel)
shift in the supply function is directly translated

M.L. Morris et al. / Agricultural Economics 10 (1994) 269-282

into a proportional increase in the value of production. While this second assumption may be
overly simplistic in some cases, it probably does
not greatly distort the estimated benefits of wheat
breeding research in Nepal, where the supply
function for wheat is fairly inelastic because
Nepal's intensive cropping systems limit farmers'
ability to adjust wheat production in response to

Most previous applications of the economic
surplus approach to wheat breeding have estimated research benefits as the product of the
yield gains attributable to adoption of MVs times
the area over which adoption takes place (for
example, see Norton et aI., 1981; Nagy, 1983;
Byerlee, 1990). 4 However, in the case of the
Nepal, this conventional approach is inappropriate. To understand why this is so, it is useful
briefly to review the history of wheat in Nepal.

4. History of wheat in Nepal: a Green Revolution
in three stages
Official statistics on wheat area, yield, and
production in Nepal extend back only to 1967/68
(Table 1). However, despite the lack of a more
extensive data series, testimony from Nepalese
scientists who have been active in wheat research
since the early 1950s suggests that the history of
wheat in Nepal can be divided into three stages:
Pre-Green Revolution period (before 1965).
Up until the mid-1960s, wheat was a minor
crop in Nepal grown primarily to provide grain
for home consumption and straw for animal feed.
Most of the varieties used were tall-statured Indian varieties, along with local land races. Area
planted to wheat fluctuated around 100000 ha

Estimation of the price elasticity of supply for wheat in
Nepal is made difficult by the lack of reliable time series data
for wheat production and farm-level prices.
4 Depending on the approach, the yield gain may be modeled
either as a one-off yield gain associated with adoption of a
specific MV, or as an average annual yield gain achieved over
time as the result of periodic replacement of older varieties by
newer varieties.

Green Revolution period (J 965 to 1990).
Nepal's wheat sector changed dramatically beginning in the mid-1960s with the introduction of
semidwarf MVs. 5 These early-maturing materials which could be harvested in 115-120 days as
co~pared to the 125-135 days required by the
older, tall-statured varieties, enabled Nepalese
farmers to switch from the traditional rice-fallow
rotation to an intensive production system in
which rice and wheat were double-cropped within
the same year. As a result, wheat area began to
increase rapidly, rising to 600000 ha by 1990.
Three MVs in particular are associated with
Nepal's Green Revolution in wheat. Lerma Rojo
64, the first MV grown on a large scale, was
introduced from Mexico in the mid-1960s and
soon spread to occupy over 70% of total wheat
area. Beginning in the late 1960s, Lerma Rojo 64
was replaced by another early-maturing semidwarf, RR21, which had been selected by Indian
wheat breeders from a Mexican cross. By the late

3

Strictly speaking, some of the wheat varieties grown in
Nepal prior to the mid-1960s were also 'modern varieties' in
the sense that they were improved products of the Indian and
Mexican breeding programs. However, these older MVs can
be distinguished from the semidwarf MVs introduced beginning in the mid-1960s, which enabled a sharp break in the
historical rate of productivity growth.

1970s, RR21 had become susceptible to foliar
diseases, and farmers began to replace it with
UP262, a more resistant MV developed by Indian
breeders from Mexican parents.
Post-Green Revolution period (after 1990).
The years from 1990 onward are expected to
become the post-Green Revolution period in
Nepal, when first-generation MVs will be replaced by newer MVs with increased yield potential and superior disease resistance. Area expansion is expected to level off during this period, so
the main benefit of the wheat breeding effort will
consist of improved genetic potential.

5. Selection of an appropriate period for analysis
Two periods were selected for analysis: (1) the
Green Revolution period (1960-1990), corresponding to the years when MVs first appeared
and spread rapidly throughout the country's major wheat-growing zones, and (2) the post-Green
Revolution period (1990-2020), when the original
MVs will be replaced by second-and third-generation MVs. While the economic surplus framework was used to analyze both periods, it is
important to note an important distinction: returns to wheat breeding during the Green Revolution period were estimated ex post (so that
most technical and economic parameters could
be estimated from historical data), whereas returns to wheat breeding during the post-Green
Revolution period were estimated ex ante (so
that technical and economic parameters had to
be predicted).

6. Returns to wheat breeding during the Green
Revolution period
Calculating the returns to wheat breeding in
Nepal during the Green Revolution period is
complicated by two factors. First, at the time of
their release, the early MVs did not always significantly outyield the varieties which farmers were
already growing. Although Lerma Rojo 64 outyielded the older, tall-statured materials which it

replaced, when they were first released RR21
and UP262 did not significantly outyield Lerma
Rojo 64. 6 Despite the lack of a clear initial yield
advantage, RR21 and UP262 were rapidly
adopted by farmers because of other desirable
characteristics - early maturity, bold grain type,
and white grain color in the case of RR21, and
disease resistance in the case of UP262. Only
later when older materials became susceptible to
foliar diseases and suffered declines in genetic
potential did yield differences emerge, most noticeably between UP262 and RR21. Second, the
MVs which revolutionized wheat production in
Nepal probably would have been adopted eventually even had there been no national wheat program. Because Nepal's principal wheat-growing
area is contiguous with a climatically similar
wheat-growing belt in India, and because many
Nepalese farmers have frequent contacts with
Indian farmers (often they are related), wheat
seed regularly crosses the border. Thus, even if
the NWRP had not been active in evaluating,
releasing, and promoting Mexican and Indian
materials, many of these materials probably would
have entered Nepal anyway through farmer-tofarmer seed exchanges.
Because of these unusual features of the Green
Revolution in Nepal, it was necessary to devise
unconventional methods for estimating two key
parameters required by the economic surplus approach: yield gains attributable to wheat breeding, and area affected by wheat research.
Yield gains attributable to wheat breeding
Since at the time of their release the MVs
associated with the Green Revolution in Nepal
did not always significantly outyield farmers' current varieties, genetic gains due to breeding cannot be calculated using the conventional 'vintage
model' approach, which assumes that newly released MVs outyield the older materials they are
designed to replace. Instead, genetic gains realized as a result of MV adoption must be esti-

For evidence on the relative performance of these early
MVs at the time of their introduction, see Basnyat (1967) and
CIMMYT (1970, 1971, 1972).

mated as yield losses foregone, under the assumption that yields in farmers' fields would have
declined as a result of increasing disease pressure
had the older susceptible varieties not been replaced. 7
The yield losses foregone in Nepal because of
varietal replacement (specifically, replacement of
RR21 by UP262; Lerma Rojo 64 was dropped
from NWRP varietal trials in the late 1960s because it had largely disappeared from farmers'
fields) were estimated using 15 years of trial data
from six agricultural research stations. 8 The following function was estimated using OLS regression techniques:

dummy variables for sites j, and u error term.

These results are noteworthy in several respects. First, the coefficient on the time trend (T)
is negative and highly significant, indicating that
over the past 15 years, yields of RR21 declined at
an average annual rate of 6.8% (Fig. 1). This
striking rate of decline appears to be due to
increasing leaf rust and Helminthosporium leaf
blight susceptibility, as well as crop and resource
management problems on the research farms
where the trials were conducted. 9 Second, the
coefficient on the intercept-shifting dummy variable (D) is not significantly different from zero.
This confirms that at the time of its introduction,
UP262 offered no significant yield advantage
compared to RR21. Third, the coefficient on the
slope-shifting multiplicative dummy variable (DT)
is positive and significant, indicating that over the
past 15 years yields of UP262 have declined approximately 2.5% per year more slowly than yields
of RR21. Since the two varieties received identical management in the experiment-station trials
from which the yield data were drawn, the only
explanation for the faster rate of yield decline of
RR21 is its higher level of susceptibility to foliar
pathogens.

The idea that MVs offer increased protection against diseases runs contrary to the conventional wisdom, which suggests that traditional wheat varieties provided superior resistance (for example, see Shiva, 1991; Conway and Barbier,
1990; Berg et aI., 1991; Hobbelink, 1991). In fact, prior to the
Green Revolution losses to diseases were often substantial in
many major wheat-growing areas of South Asia (Byerlee,
1994). The MVs associated with Nepal's Green Revolution in
wheat greatly reduced the risk of disease losses by incorporating resistance genes identified over the course of more than
20 years of research in Mexico and elsewhere.
8 Use of farm-level yield data would have been preferable, but
unfortunately such data were not available over an extended
period. Use of experiment-station data is justified by the fact
that varietal trials in Nepal are conducted using levels of key
inputs (e.g., fertilizer and irrigation) similar to those used by
farmers.

Area affected by wheat research

Under the economic surplus approach, the area
affected by a plant breeding program can be
measured either indirectly (in the form of a shift
in the supply curve, which implicitly reflects
changes in area planted) or directly (by estimating the rate of adoption of MVs and applying this
rate of adoption to the area planted to the crop).
A direct approach was used in this study. However, use of the conventional method would have
understated the impact of the Green Revolution
in Nepal, where the introduction of early-maturing MVs in and of itself spurred a significant
expansion in wheat area which would not other-

Nepalese wheat scientists, extension agents, and farmers
report that a similar declining yield trend has also been
observed in farmers' fields. However, this effect is masked in
national average yield data because farmers, unlike researchers, have been applying increasing amounts of fertilizer
and other inputs to compensate for declining genetic potential.

wise have occurred. Therefore, Nepal's wheat
area was disaggregated into two components: a
'base area' which probably would have been
planted to wheat even if early-maturing MVs had
not been introduced (estimated by applying a 3%
annual long-term growth rate to the area planted
to wheat prior to 1968, the year in which wheat
area began to expand rapidly), and an 'incremental area' which was planted to wheat only because
of the appearance of MVs (Fig. 2).
Different methods were used to estimate the
benefits of breeding research in each of the two
areas. Since the incremental area by definition
was not planted to wheat prior to the appearance
of MVs, the benefits to wheat breeding over the
incremental area could not be estimated in the
same way as for the base area (i.e., based on the
difference between the yield of old varieties and
MVs). Because the appearance of MVs made
wheat production possible on land which previously had been left fallow, a different measure of
value-added was needed to estimate the benefits.
Thus, the benefits on the incremental area were
estimated as the net returns per hectare of wheat
production (defined as gross returns minus fixed
and variable costs). No opportunity cost was de-

ducted from the net returns figure to compensate
for the displacement of competing crops, since
farmers expanded wheat area by using land previously left fallow. 10
Insufficient data were available to allow separate calculation of net returns to wheat production in every year throughout the period of analysis (1960-1990), so it was necessary to make the
simplifying assumption that net returns have remained constant in real terms over the past three
decades. 11 Net returns per hectare of wheat production were estimated for 1982-83 based on
crop budgets published by the Nepal Ministry of
Agriculture and projected back over the life of
the research program. Expressed in 1990 Rupees,
net returns averaged Rs 2000jha for improved,

10 Although it probably would have been desirable to adjust
the net returns figure to account for long-term costs possibly
associated with the intensification of the cropping system
(e.g., accelerated rate of soil fertility decline, increased pressure on ground water resources), this was not done, since it
was not known how to quantify such costs.
11 It is important to note that this is not the same as assuming
that the price of wheat remained constant throughout the
period - which it did not.

partially irrigated wheat in the Mid-hills and Rs
2500/ha for improved irrigated wheat in the
Terai). 12
Benefits over the base area were estimated
using the conventional method of multiplying the
genetic gains attributable to MVs (in this case,
the yield losses foregone) times the area planted
to MVs. 13 However, as pointed out earlier, even
had there been no national wheat program in
Nepal, MV adoption probably would have occurred anyway as the result of farmer-to-farmer
seed exchanges along the India-Nepal border.
Since the real impact of the NWRP was to accelerate the rate of adoption, the area affected by
the Nepalese wheat breeding program was modeled as the difference between the actual historical MV adoption pattern and the hypothetical
adoption pattern which likely would have prevailed in the absence of the NWRP (Fig. 3).
Parameters of the actual historical adoption pattern (modeled as a logistic curve) were estimated
based on information provided by knowledgeable
Nepalese wheat scientists about the spread of
MVs, supplemented by data from producer surveys carried out during the past three decades. 14
Parameters of the hypothetical 'without research'
adoption pattern were estimated based on the
rate of adoption of Indian varieties which were
never released in Nepal but which came in over
the border. Separate adoption curves were estimated under both 'with research' and 'without
research' scenarios for the two main wheat-growing zones, Terai and Mid-hills, with adoption
taking longer in the Mid-hills due to the lack of
transportation and communication infrastructure.
Ceiling adoption levels were conservatively assumed to be 80% for both zones, even though
recent surveys suggest that the adoption of MVs

in the Terai is now approaching 100% (Harrington et aI., 1992).
Other parameters used in the ex post analysis
Average annual wheat prices at the farm level,
adjusted for inflation, were used in valuing the
research benefits (both the extra production attributable to accelerated adoption of MVs over
the base area, as well as the production from the
incremental area).
Three categories of research expenditures were
included on the cost side: (1) the NWRP budget,
(2) the budgets of the eleven research farms
where wheat research takes place, and (3) wheat
research costs of scientists working in the disciplinary divisions in the Ministry of Agriculture.
The three categories were disaggregated into
breeding and breeding support costs, seed production costs, and other research costs (e.g., crop
management research costs).
Based on estimates made by NWRP breeders
about the length of time involved in screening,
selecting, testing, and releasing a new wheat variety, a research lag of eight years was assumed,
meaning that eight years of research costs were
incurred prior to the release of the first MV.
Using the parameters summarized in Table 2,
the IRR to wheat breeding in Nepal during the
Green Revolution period (1960-1990) was estimated as 84%. This figure includes returns to
wheat breeding and breeding support activities,
as well as to seed production activities carried out

MV adoption were estimated to be larger in the Terai than in
the Mid-hills.

wheat breeding program. This estimated IRR,
while high by conventional investment criteria,
falls within the range of IRRS reported in other
recent studies of the of returns to investment in
wheat research (Table 3).

7. Returns to wheat breeding during the postGreen Revolution period

As Nepal enters into the post-Green Revolution period, Nepalese policy makers must decide
an appropriate level of funding for future wheat
research. Although past investment in wheat research in Nepal has generated attractive rates of
return, several of the key parameters which contributed to large benefits in the past can be
expected to change. In particular, the rapid expansion in area planted to wheat resulting from
the introduction of early maturing varieties can
be expected to slow as remaining arable land is
brought under cultivation. In addition, as average
wheat yields continue to rise, future rates of yield
gain can be expected to decelerate.
Unlike ex post analysis, which is based on
historical events, ex ante analysis requires making
predictions about the future. Given the uncer-

277

tainty inherent in predicting what is going to
happen in farmers' fields, returns to investment
in wheat research in Nepal during the post-Green
Revolution period were estimated under a set of
extremely conservative baseline assumptions concerning likely future yield gains, varietal adoption
rates, and increases in wheat area. These assumptions were then systematically relaxed, and sensitivity analysis was carried out to determine how
the returns respond to changes in the parameters.
Key parameters used in the baseline ex ante
analysis are described below.
Area affected by wheat research
As Nepal enters the post-Green Revolution
period and opportunities for further intensification are exhausted, expansion in wheat area can
be expected to slow. In the baseline scenario,
future wheat area was assumed to remain constant at current levels of 250000 ha in the Midhills and 350000 ha in the Terai. The latter
assumption in particular is very conservative, since
currently only about one-third of the rice area in
the Terai is rotated with wheat. As infrastructure
improves (especially irrigation), wheat area in the
Terai will likely increase substantially. Under the
conservative assumption that no further expansion in area will occur, the area affected by wheat
research will be the area planted to MVs sooner
than would have occurred in the absence of a
Nepalese wheat research program. This area was
calculated as the difference between the same
'with research' and 'without research' adoption
curves used in the ex post analysis.
Expected future growth in wheat yields
Although past yield gains attributable to adoption of MVs were estimated as 2.5% per year,
there is no reason to assume that a similar rate
will necessarily be achieved during the post-Green
Revolution period. Therefore, instead of simply
extrapolating past genetic gains into the future,
potential future yield gains were estimated based
on the performance of germplasm which is currently in the pipeline - MVs which have been
tested, selected, and released for distribution to
farmers, but which have not yet been widely
adopted.

278

The potential rate of future yield gains was
estimated through use of a vintage model using
data from varietal trials carried out at six research stations in the Terai during 1978-1990.
Eight varieties representing six vintages were included, representing the currently dominant variety (UP262), as well as all subsequent releases for
which trial data are available. 15 Because the data
set was unbalanced, the residual maximum likelihood (REML) estimation method was chosen in
order to improve the precision of the
estimates. 16,17 The vintage model was specified
as follows:
( 4)

where Yijt is yield of variety i in site j in trial year
t, m grand mean, Vi fixed effect for variety i, Yt
fixed effect for trial year t, (s /Y)j random effect
for site j, and u random error term.
Predicted mean varietal yields were then regressed against year of release (vintage) using a
log-linear formulation to estimate the average
annual rate of yield gains in varieties released
since 1978 (Fig. 4), This rate was estimated as
g = 1.25%, which may be interpreted as the potential future rate of yield gains. In the baseline
scenario, future wheat yields were projected from
current levels of 1.25 tjha in the Mid-hills and
1.6 t/ha in the Terai using this annual rate of
increase. In the sensitivity analysis, several alter-

15 The number of varieties is greater than the number of
vintages because in several years more than one variety was
released.
16 This frequently-encountered problem results from the way
varietal yield trials are carried out: promising new varieties
are periodically added to a trial, retained for some variable
length of time, and eventually dropped when they no longer
perform as well as later introductions. Although one or two
check varieties may be retained throughout the duration of a
trial, observations for most of the varieties wiJl be available
only for a limited number of years, resulting in an unbalanced
data set unsuitable for OLS estimation procedures.
17 The vintage model was estimated using the Residual Maximum Likelihood (REML) software package developed by the
Scottish Agricultural Statistics Service at the University of
Edinburgh.

native future rates of yield increases (both higher
and lower) were considered.
Other parameters used in the ex ante analysis

In the baseline scenario, the future real price
of wheat was assumed to remain constant at
current levels of 5000 Rs/t. The marketing margin was also assumed to remain constant at current levels of 25% of the consumer prices. In the
sensitivity analysis, changes in both the retail
price and the marketing margin were considered.
In the baseline scenario, future investment in
wheat breeding research was assumed to remain
constant in real terms at current levels of 1.2
million Rupees. It was assumed that Nepalese
wheat scientists spend an average of eight years
screening and selecting imported materials between the release of each successful variety. In
other words, eight years of research costs are
incurred before the realization of benefits through
adoption. In the sensitivity analysis, changes in
the length of the research lag were considered.
Using the parameters summarized in Table 4,
the IRR to future investment in wheat research in
Nepal was estimated as 49%. 18 This figure includes returns to wheat breeding and breeding
support activities, as well as seed production activities carried out on the research stations by
staff of the wheat breeding program. This projected IRR is lower than the past rate of returns
for two reasons. First, the dramatic expansion in
wheat area attributed to the introduction of MVs
during the Green Revolution period is projected
to slow. Second, future rates of yield gain attributable to the replacement of older MVs by
newer MVs is expected to be more modest than
in the past.
Sensitivity analysis

In order to assess the robustness of the projected rates of return, the values of many of the
key parameters used in estimating the baseline

18 Research costs and benefits were projected for the period
1990-2020. Beyond 30 years into the future, the present value
of costs and benefits becomes negligible due to the effects of
discounting.

research will be much more sensitive to some
parameters than to others. Relatively large
changes in the projected price of wheat and in
the size of the marketing margin will have modest
effects on the projected IRR, indicating that returns to wheat breeding will not be highly sensitive to changes in the world price of wheat.
Similarly, the projected IRR is relatively insensitive to changes in the projected rate of growth in
wheat area, the projected rate of growth in wheat
yields attributable to research, and to the projected adoption ceiling. On the other hand, the
projected IRR is moderately sensitive to the research lag (i.e., the length of the period of research investment preceding the release of each
successful variety).
8. Discussion
Investment in wheat breeding in Nepal has
generated an internal rate of return of about 84%

during the past three decades. This attractive rate
of return is explained by the relatively modest
cost of the Nepalese wheat research program in
relation to the substantial benefits it generates.
On the cost side, NWRP has been able to take
advantage of close links with the Indian wheat
research program and with CIMMYT in capturing substantial benefits in the form of exotic
germplasm which is generally well adapted to
production conditions in Nepal; by screening and
selecting superior materials coming out of these
programs, Nepalese wheat scientists have been
able to release several highly successful varieties
while managing to avoid a substantial portion of
the expenses involved in their development. On
the benefit side, two main factors can be identified as having contributed to the success of the
Nepalese wheat research effort. The first generation of MVs released in Nepal, particularly RR21,
fueled a dramatic increase in wheat area due to
their early maturity, which made possible

double-cropping of wheat and rice in areas where •
farmers had previously been restricted to one
crop per year. Subsequently, the replacement of
RR21 by UP262 and other newer varieties en- "
abled farmers to avoid yield losses due to a
breakdown in disease resistance. Experimental
data suggest that failure to replace RR21 would
have resulted in disease-related yield losses of
2.5% per year.
Although expansion in wheat area can be expected to slow in coming years, returns to wheat
breeding research in Nepal will remain attractive
under a wide range of plausible economic and
technical parameters. Under a baseline scenario
in which future investment in wheat breeding is
assumed to remain constant (in real terms) at
current levels, the IRR is projected to reach 49%.
Significantly, expected future benefits from wheat
research are based exclusively on the improved
yield potential already present in recently-released materials, i.e., assuming no future benefits
from disease resistance. To the extent that regular varietal replacement will enable farmers to
continue to avoid yield losses due to the breakdown in disease resistance of older varieties (the
main source of benefits in the past), future returns could be considerably higher.
These findings can be taken as a strong endorsement for continued investment in wheat
breeding research in Nepal. Although future returns cannot be expected to attain the spectacular rates achieved in the past, they will remain
extremely attractive by conventional investment
criteria. However, the desirable balance between
breeding and crop management research will
probably change over time. While the benefits
realized during the Green Revolution period resulted mainly from the adoption of improved
germplasm, evidence of declining yields both at
the farm level as well as on experiment stations
suggests that crop and resource management
problems will assume increasing importance in
the future.
More generally, the results of this study indicate that it may be rational to establish plant
breeding programs for commodities planted over
limited areas if such breeding programs can assist
farmers in capturing research spillovers emanat-

ing elsewhere (e.g., neighboring countries, inter-

• national agricultural research centers, the private

sector). Although supporting a fully-developed
breeding program may not be warranted in cases
where benefits are expected to be modest, maintaining the ability to speed the selection and
dissemination of imported germplasm can be
highly desirable on economic grounds (Brennan,
1992; Maredia, 1993). This conclusion would appear to be particularly relevant for smaller countries which are struggling to maintain fully developed breeding programs for major crops in the
face of declining levels of funding for agricultural
research, as well as for larger countries which
must decide what to do about minor crops.
