Abstract: In earlier debates on economic development, the agricultural sector’s role was
somewhat controversial. While dualistic models highlighted the importance of
agriculture, the mainstream literature placed a greater emphasis on the creation of a
modern industrial sector. Soon agriculture disappeared from the mainstream development
literature to re-emerge recently with a variety of multiple-sector growth models
emphasizing the key role of agriculture and specifically technology in agriculture. This
paper is an empirical cross-country analysis of agricultural technology’s role in economic
development. Specifically, the hypothesis being tested is whether improvements in
agricultural technology have a significant impact on long-run economic growth. The
results indicate that agricultural modernization has a positive effect on both measures of
economic growth and human development.

Economic Development and the Role of Agricultural Technology
Introduction
Initially development economics concentrated on questions concerning the
industrialization process. The main questions had to do with how to modernize through
overcoming the constraints of traditional society. The latter was often linked with
agriculture and rural people, commonly called peasant agriculture. This sector was
generally thought to act as a drag on the development process. Thus traditional and
peasant farming were obstacles, systems which had to be reduced and eventually
eliminated if modernization was to succeed.
However, economic historians often saw agriculture as playing a critical role in
the industrialization of England. Dualistic models also directly modeled traditional
agriculture in the long-run growth process. In these models the conclusion often implied
that the long-run growth process must be a balanced one with agricultural productivity a
necessary condition for eventual industrial/manufacturing growth. In other words, if
productivity in agriculture remained stagnant, the development of a modern
manufacturing sector would be limited.
Throughout much of the 1980s and 1990s much of the analysis of the
role/contribution of agriculture was carried out by agricultural economists. Much of this
work concentrated on technological innovation in agriculture, the institutional structure
necessary to foster technical innovation, etc. However, in terms of long-run growth
models, agriculture disappeared. This sector and its role were, for the most part, ignored
in models of long-run growth emphasizing industrialization and manufacturing.

Recently, however, one finds a re-emergence of interest in agriculture. Papers by
Gollin, et. al. (2002) and Olsson and Hibbs (2005) argue that agriculture and the
productivity of agriculture is the key to understanding the timing of the shift from an
agrarian based to an industrially based society. The importance of agricultural
technology in reducing poverty is found in Lipton (1977), Kerr and Kolavalli (1999),
Datt and Ravallion (1998), Ravallion and Datt (1999), Mellor (2001), and Thirtle et al.
(2003) to name a few. In addition, some non-traditional roles have also been attributed to
agriculture in the development process.
Given the literature referred to above on the importance of agriculture and
agricultural technology in the development process, the hypothesis in this paper
concerning agriculture is that improvements in agricultural technology are a precondition to, and have a significant positive impact on, long-run growth. The implication
of such a hypothesis would be that countries which did not have the necessary precondition, that is they did not improve agricultural technology, did not grow as fast as
those that did. The paper is an empirical exercise in testing the above hypothesis.
The paper is organized as follows. The first section will review the literature,
both traditional and non-traditional, on agriculture’s role in the growth and development
process. Section two will discuss the data utilized as well as the empirical methodology
that is applied. Sections three and four will summarize the empirical results with respect
to growth and various measures of agricultural technology. Section five will present the
results related to human development. Finally, section six summarizes the paper and
presents the important conclusions.

Review of the Literature
Much of the early thinking on economic development ignored agriculture
altogether. For example, Rosenstein-Rodan’s (1943) early work concentrated on
manufacturing and industry. He argued that the piecemeal establishment of
manufacturing in poor regions lacking infrastructure would not likely be successful.
Instead, investment in industry and manufacturing had to be on a broad front such that
various industries could create markets for each other’s products.
There were a set of theories which, however, did see a role in the development
process for agriculture. These were dualistic theories of development constructed by
Lewis (1954), Fei and Ranis (1961), and Jorgenson (1961). These theories divided the
less developed economy into the traditional and modern sector. The modern sector was
driven by profit maximization and the accumulation of physical capital. The traditional
sector was subsistence oriented and usually thought to be dominated by peasant
agricultural production. This sector was characterized by output sharing mechanisms
rather than profit maximization.
In many of these models it was presumed that the traditional sector was
characterized by surplus labor. That is, there was so much labor in this sector that it
could be withdrawn and put to productive work in the modern sector without any fall in
output in the traditional sector (marginal product of labor in the traditional sector is zero).
In effect, “free growth” was possible through mobilization of labor for modern
production. However, once surplus labor was exhausted, the expansion of the modern
sector might very well be strangled. Continued withdrawal of labor would lead to falling
output in the traditional sector leading to a rise in the relative price of the traditional

3

sector output relative to that in the modern sector. Johnston and Mellor (1961) built upon
these ideas in their analysis of the role of agriculture in overall economic development.
They argued that agriculture supplied the labor necessary to man the modern sector firms
as well as the food necessary to feed that labor. In addition, the agricultural sector was
seen as serving as a market for the produce of the modern sector, a stimulus from the
demand side. Finally, perhaps most importantly, agriculture was likely to serve as the
main source of savings necessary to finance the expansion of the modern sector.
After these developments, agriculture disappeared from general models aimed at
analyzing economic growth and development. Instead, much of the literature concerned
with agriculture concentrated on analyzing productivity growth in the traditional,
agricultural sector. Perhaps the most interesting and innovative work in this area has
been undertaken by Hayami and Ruttan (1985) in developing a theory of induced
technical and institutional innovation.
Recently, multiple sector growth models have begun to be constructed with
agricultural sectors. Matsuyama (1991) developed an endogenous, two sector growth
model. In this model the engine of growth, the driving force, was learning by doing in
the manufacturing sector. He compared and contrasted the implications of a closed and
open economy model. In the closed economy case, an increase in agricultural
productivity (as measured by total factor productivity) spurs overall economic growth
since this eases the expansion of learning by doing via manufacturing. However, in the
open economy case there is a negative link between agricultural productivity and overall
growth. This occurs because the more productive the agricultural sector is, the more

4

resources that will be devoted to agriculture based on comparative advantage. This, of
course, implies less manufacturing, less learning by doing, and less growth.
The results from Matsuyama’s model are, of course, based on assuming that all
learning by doing occurs in manufacturing, none in agriculture. However, learning by
doing in manufacturing could enhance productivity in agriculture and perhaps vice versa.
More generally, the model’s results stem from the assumption that agriculture is, by
nature, incapable of sustaining rapid productivity growth. Thus it is inevitable that higher
initial productivity in agriculture (exogenously determined) would lower long-run
growth.
This idea that productivity growth is slow in agriculture is actually contradicted
by empirical analysis. Martin and Mitra (2001) utilize a panel data set for approximately
50 countries over the period 1967-1992 to analyze this issue. They found that at all
levels of development technical progress appears to have been faster in agriculture than
in manufacturing. In addition, “there is strong evidence of convergence in levels and
growth rates of TFP in agriculture, suggesting relatively rapid international dissemination
of innovation” (p.417). These results suggest that a large agricultural sector need not be a
disadvantage in the overall growth process. It may likely be an advantage if productivity
growth is rapid.
There is also a huge literature on the role of the agricultural sector and agricultural
technology in reducing poverty. Thirtle, et al. (2003) shows that research-led
technological change in the agricultural sector generates enough productivity growth to
generate high rates of return in Africa and Asia and substantially reduces poverty in these
regions. Additionally, Lipton (1977) showed that agricultural growth based on improved

5

technology was effective in reducing poverty in developing countries. Kerr and Kolavalli
(1999) argued that it was research-led technological change in agriculture that led Asian
countries from famines to food sufficiency. Mellor (2001) argued that agricultural
productivity reduces both rural as well as urban poverty, an idea echoed in Datt and
Ravallion (1998) and Ravallion and Datt (1999). Sectoral studies conducted for
individual countries or selected regions by Datt and Ravallion (1996), Warr (2001), and
Woden (1999), conducting research on India, Southeast Asia, and Bangladesh
respectively, show that growth in the primary or agricultural sector helps to reduce both
rural as well as urban poverty more effectively than urban growth.
Theorists have now begun to explicitly model the agricultural sector in multiple
sector growth models. A recent example of this is provided by the work of Gollin,
Parente, and Rogerson (2002). They extend the neoclassical model to incorporate an
agricultural sector. They attempt to model the structural transformation that comes with
development (agriculture shrinking, manufacturing expanding). The intuition of the
model can be summarized as follows. Agricultural output per person must reach a certain
level before modern technology will be applied to agricultural production and labor can
flow out of agriculture and into industry. The rate at which labor can then flow out is
determined by the rate of technological change in agriculture. Low agricultural
productivity (labor productivity) can thus substantially delay the onset of
industrialization.
Other research has examined new links between agriculture and the growth of the
rest of the economy. One can think of these new links as representing non-traditional
roles for agriculture. Timmer (1995) argues that agriculture plays a significant role in

6

reducing poverty by stimulating the development of agribusiness activities as well as
stimulating the demand for manufactured inputs. Stringer (2001) argues that the
agricultural sector performs important social welfare functions in developing nations.
For example, during an economic downturn or an external income shock or financial
crisis, agriculture can act “as a buffer, safety net, and as an economic stabilizer” (p.7).
The flexibility of the production process allows for labor to be substituted for capital thus
cushioning economic blows. Thus people frequently return to the farm during bad times.
One can summarize much of this discussion in the following way. Agriculture’s
role in the development process can be seen as a supplier of resources, most importantly
labor, for the expansion of modern manufacturing. If disequilibrium exists such that the
marginal product of labor in manufacturing exceeds that in agriculture (the marginal
product of labor in agriculture need not be zero as Lewis originally argued), then
transferring labor from the agricultural sector to the manufacturing sector will enhance
overall growth. Empirically, there seems to be support for the proposition that factor
market disequilibrium creates an opportunity to enhance growth by reallocating resources
from agriculture to manufacturing (see Humphries and Knowles (1998), Dowrick and
Gemmell (1991), and Feder (1986)). A second strand of thought argues that before the
industrialization process can occur an increase in agricultural productivity must occur.
Related to this, improvements in productivity in agriculture may indeed be easier for less
developed nations to bring about, that is the potential for raising agricultural productivity
may be very great, providing the foundation for rapid overall growth. Finally, enhanced
agricultural productivity may be the most effective mechanism for improving well being
in rural areas and this in turn may promote more rapid overall growth.

7

This paper focuses on the role of agricultural productivity (as measured by
agricultural technology) in the process of overall growth and its impact on well being.
Several questions suggest themselves. Is the modernization of agriculture an important
determinant of overall growth? Is this effect robust to the inclusion of other variables?
Given the non-traditional roles for agriculture, does agricultural modernization have a
significant impact on human development? Is this impact robust to the inclusion of other
variables? The key contribution of this paper is to utilize several measures of agricultural
technology in an empirical estimation process which seeks to answer these questions.
The methodology and data that will be utilized to address these questions is discussed in
the following section.

Methodology and Data
In this paper, it is hypothesized that better agricultural technology which leads to
improvements in agricultural productivity is a pre-condition for and has a significant
impact on long-run growth, where growth is defined as the average rate of change of real
per capita GDP from 1960 to 1995. This paper utilizes four different measures of
agricultural productivity. The first two measures of agricultural productivity are a
measure of fertilizer intensity and an interaction term of fertilizer and tractor intensity.
Often agricultural technology is divided into two categories: biochemical and
mechanical. Biochemical technologies generally require an intensification of fertilizer
usage while mechanical innovations require increased usage of implements such as
tractors, often combined with increased fertilizer use. The third measure is an interaction
term incorporating fertilizer intensity, tractor intensity, and education of the labor force.

8

This incorporates a human capital element under the assumption that biochemical and
mechanical technologies can only be effectively used if the individuals utilizing them
have sufficient knowledge.
The first three measures of productivity discussed above are indirect in nature in
that the assumption is that the more intensive the use of tractors, fertilizer, and education,
the more productive the agricultural sector. The fourth measure of agricultural
productivity is total factor productivity in agriculture as measured by the Malmquist
index. The index uses a non-parametric approach for constructing production frontiers
for a group of countries and measuring each country’s output relative to that frontier.
Productivity growth measures the extent to which a country moves towards this frontier
even as this frontier itself moves out (via technological change) through time. It is a
general measure of productivity (incorporating the effect of all inputs) rather than a
partial measure (such as the average product of labor or capital).
The first three measures of agricultural technology are utilized in the analysis of
this section of the paper. In order to get some intuition in terms of the relation between
economic growth and the first three measures of agricultural technology, the analysis
begins by checking the correlation between economic growth (growth in real GDP per
capita) over the time period 1960 to 1995 and each of the three measures of agricultural
productivity at the beginning of the period.

Table 1 goes here

9

The lnFert61 variable is the natural log of fertilizer intensity for the year 1961. It
is measured as kilograms (nitrogen, potash, phosphates) per hectare of land in 1961. The
second measure of agricultural technology is lnModern61. It is an interaction term
formed by multiplying fertilizer intensity (1961) by tractor intensity (tractors per hectare
of land in 1961). The third measure is lnAgModern61 which is an interaction term
formed by multiplying fertilizer intensity in 1961 by tractor intensity in 1961 by average
years of schooling (1965). This is a broader measure of agricultural technology since it
incorporates the impact of tractors and human capital. Average years of schooling in
1965 represents the earliest availability of this data. The correlation table shows that all
three measures of initial agricultural productivity are highly correlated to economic
growth.
In order to test the hypothesis of the paper, we begin by constructing a simple
model given by:
(1a) GR6095 = a + b(lnGDP60) + c(lnFert61) + d(Asia) + e(LatA) + f(SSA) + ε,
(1b) GR6095 = a + b(lnGDP60) + c (lnModern61) + d(Asia) + e(LatA) + f(SSA) + ε,
(1c) GR6095 = a + b(lnGDP60) + c (lnAgModern61) + d(Asia) + e(LatA) + f(SSA) + ε.
The dependent variable is given by GR6095 which is the growth rate of real GDP
per capita from 1960 to 1995. In addition to the measures of agricultural technology, the
two equations also include the natural log of GDP per capita in 1960 (lnGDP60) in order
to capture any sort of convergence effect which might occur. Additionally, regional
dummy variables for Asia (Asia) Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), and Latin America (LatA)
are also included. Equations (1a), (1b) and (1c) try to capture the impact of agricultural
technology on per capita GDP growth for the given period after we control for the

10

influences of per capita GDP at the beginning of this time period, to account for any
convergence or residual effect, as well as regional impact from the three regions
mentioned above.
It should be pointed out that the type of analysis illustrated above is subject to an
endogeneity issue or problem. There are two related issues that explain the endogeneity
problem. First, endogenous variables are those variables which are determined by other
variables in the system as opposed to exogenous variables which can be considered
external shocks to the system. The other most important source of endogeneity is reverse
causality that is when two variables (or more) may be causing each other simultaneously.
Thus, to be able to make an authentic causal claim one needs a truly exogenous variable,
that is, a variable which is not related to any of the other variables in the system,
unobserved or observed. The implication of such endogeneity issues for the purpose of
this paper is that our main independent variable (a measure of agricultural technology)
and the dependent variable could be influenced by some other unobserved factor and/or
the variables could be bi-directionally causal. Thus making arguments concerning
causality from independent to dependent variables becomes problematic. Although we
have chosen measures of technology at the start of the time period under analysis, this
does not completely solve the problem. The ideal solution to the problem would be to
use instrumental variables estimations. However, useful and appropriate instruments are
not immediately obvious and using the wrong instruments would lead to unreliable
results. With this in mind, we have decided not to pursue instrumental variables analysis.
However, given the discussion above we would like to acknowledge the imitations in our
present analysis given the possible endogeneity issues.

11

After estimating the above equation(s) the model is broadened to identify and
control for other variables that may also have affected the growth of per capita GDP
during that period. This will also serve as a test of robustness of the results to model
specification. The more general model is given by the following equations:
(2a) GR6095 = a + b(lnGDP60) + c(lnFert61) + d(lnSchool65) + e(lnInv6095)
+ f(LogFrankRom) + g(ICRGE80) + h(Asia) + i(LatA) + j(SSA) + ε,
(2b) GR6095 = a + b(lnGDP60) + c(lnFERT61) + d(lnSchool65) + e(Inv6095)
+ f(LogFrankRom) + g(Statehist) + h(Asia) + i(LatA) + j(SSA) + ε,
(3a) GR6095 = a + b(lnGDP60) + c(lnModern61) + d(lnSchool65) + e(lnInv6095)
+ f(LogFrankRom) + g(ICRGE80) + h(Asia)+ i(LatA) + j(SSA) + ε,
(3b) GR6095 = a + b(lnGDP60) + c(lnModern61) + d(lnSchool65) + e(lnInv6095)
+ f(LogFrankRom) + g(Statehist) + h(Asia) + i(LatA) + j(SSA) + ε,
(4a) GR6095 = a + b(lnGDP60) + c(lnAgModern61) + d(lnInv6095) + e(LogFrankRom)
+ f(ICRGE80) + g(Asia) + h(LatA) + i(SSA) + ε,
(4b) GR6095 = a + b(lnGDP60) + c(lnAgModern61) + d(lnInv6095) + e(LogFrankRom)
+ f(Statehist) + g(Asia) + h(LatA) + i(SSA) + ε.
One of the additional variables added is a measure for educational attainment
given by lnSchool65 which is the natural log of the years of total schooling of the
population in 1965. Since lnAgModern61 includes a measure of human capital, the
lnSchool65 variable was excluded from the estimation of equations (4a) and (4b) to avoid
multicollinearity issues. Additional variables include a measure of investment given by
lnInv6095 which is the natural log of average investment from 1960 to 1995 (this is gross
capital formation which consists of additions to the fixed assets of the economy plus the

12

net change in inventories), a measure of institutional quality given by ICRGE80 which is
an average of five different measures of institutional quality, a variable for state antiquity
given by Statehist , and a series of dummy variables for Asia (Asia), Latin America
(LatA), and Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Finally, most previous empirical work generally
include some measure of the degree of openness of a nation. To measure this, the
instrumental variable constructed by Frankel and Roemer (1996) is utilized. It is the log
of the predicted trade share of an economy, based on a gravity model of international
trade that only uses a country’s population and geographical features (LogFrankRom).
Frankel and Roemer (1996) indicate that this variable is strongly related to actual trade
shares.1
Several of these variables need further explanation. The Statehist variable is an
index measuring the type of state that exists (tribal level or above, foreign or locally
based, the territorial extent of the state) and how long it has existed for various regions of
the world. The time period covered is from 1 to 1950 C.E. The higher the index number,
the longer a state has been in existence. The hypothesis is that the longer the state has
been in existence, the more likely it will have resolved issues of internal conflict and the
more legitimate the state is likely to be viewed by its citizens. Thus growth is likely to be
higher. The ICRGE80 variable is an average of measures of corruption, repudiation of
contracts, expropriation risk, rule of law, and bureaucratic quality for the year 1980. The
higher this average, the better the quality of institutions and better quality institutions are
thought to enhance growth. As it turns out, the Statehist and ICRGE80 variables are
strongly related to each other. As a result, in order to avoid multicollinearity issues these
variables were not included together in any estimation. This accounts for two versions,

13

(a) and (b), for each of the equations given above. Version (a) includes the institutional
quality variable ICRGE80 and version (b) includes the state antiquity variable Statehist.
There have been a number of papers that have utilized ICRGE for various years as
a measure of institutional quality (Knack and Keefer, 1995), in an attempt to explain
growth. Easterly and Levine (2003) have used a similar set of variables to try to make a
distinction between the effects of endowments and the effects of institutions on per capita
GDP. Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2001) and Rodrik, Subramanian, and Trebbi
(2004) use instruments for measures of institutional quality and attempt to distinguish
between the effects of geography, institutions, and policy on GDP per capita.
Much of the data used to estimate this and the previous equation are taken from
Bockstette, Chanda, and Putterman (2002). Specifically, GR6095, lnGDP60, lnInv6095,
ICRGE80, Statehist, and the regional dummies all come from this paper. The lnSchool65
variable comes from Barro and Lee (1993). The fertilizer intensity and tractor intensity
variables are taken from the World Resources Institute (www.wri.org/) who in turn
derived the data from the FAO.
The discussion of the previous section indicated that agriculture is likely to play
an important role in terms of providing a safety net for a society lacking formal programs
aimed at social welfare. Under such an assumption one would expect that the level of
human development would also be influenced by agricultural modernization. In order to
test this proposition, per capita GDP growth is replaced with the average level of the
human development index (HDI) from 1975 to 1995 as the dependent variable. The HDI
is a summary measure of human development which is calculated as
HDI = 1/3 (life expectancy index) + 1/3 (education index) + 1/3 (GDP index).

14

The life expectancy index measures life expectancy at birth (relative measure), the
education index is a weighted index of the adult literacy rate and the gross enrollment
index, and the GDP index is calculated using adjusted GDP per capita (PPP US$).
The data used to calculate the average is taken from various issues of the Human
Development Report. Thus the following equation is estimated to test the hypothesis.
(5a) HDI7595 = α + β(lnFert61) + γ(lnInv6095) + δ(ICRGE80) + ζ(LogFrankRom) +
θ(Asia) + λ(LatA) + ν(SSA) + ε.
(5b) HDI7595 = α + β(lnModern61) + γ(lnInv6095) + δ(ICRGE80) + ζ(LogFrankRom)
+ θ(Asia) + λ(LatA) + ν(SSA) + ε.
Notice that lnAgModern61 is not utilized as an independent variable. This is due
to the fact that it incorporates a measure of educational levels and education, as discussed
above, is also incorporated in HDI7595. Also, the lnGDP60 is also excluded since
convergence in GDP is not being tested. The above equations are also estimated utilizing
the Statehist variable as a substitute for ICRGE80. These are both measures of the
quality of institutions and the argument here is that improved institutional quality is likely
to result in improved well being. The inclusion of lnInv6095 in the estimating equation is
linked to the hypothesis that the more investment that occurs in a country, the greater
economic opportunities are likely to be and thus the more likely that individuals will be
able to find jobs and thus experience improvements in well being. The greater the
openness to trade is also included since it is hypothesized that the resulting increases in
income will improve welfare. Finally, as outlined in Section One of the paper,
agricultural productivity has been included in the estimated equation because it is thought
by some scholars to have a direct impact on poverty and thus well being. That is, a

15

highly productive and prosperous agricultural sector is likely to have farmers that are in
good health and have greater access to education in addition to higher incomes.
The data set covers 89 countries (27 African, 22 Latin American, 14 Asian, 5
Middle Eastern, 16 European, 5 others). For various regressions some countries have
missing values, thus the size of the sample accordingly shrinks. The next section of the
paper will discuss and interpret the results.

Results: First Three Measures of Technology
The results of the estimations of equations (1a), (1b), and (1c) are presented in
Table 2. All estimations are OLS estimations and all the results are based on White
heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors and covariances. As can be seen, all three
measures of agricultural technology have positive, significant effects on long-term
economic growth. In addition, it appears that when we control for initial agricultural
technology, irrespective of how it is measured, conditional convergence is also occurring
among the countries in the sample, given the negative, statistically significant coefficient
for GDP per capita in 1960. Finally, the dummy variables for Latin America and
Subsaharan Africa were negative and statistically significant.

Table 2 goes here

The results indicate that agricultural technology, measured three ways, had a
significant impact on long-run growth. In order to test the robustness of the result,

16

equations (2a), (2b), (3a), (3b), (4a), and (4b) are estimated and the results are presented
in Table 3. All estimations show that there is evidence of conditional convergence.
Moreover the results also testify to the robustness of the statistically significant and
positive impact that agricultural technology has on per capita GDP growth from the mid1960’s to the mid 1990’s.
Table 3 goes here

Examining the results for equations (2a) and (2b), one can see that the Statehist
and ICRGE80 variables are positive and statistically significant when included
separately. The variables lnSchool65 and lnInv6095 are positive, but are only statistically
significant for (2b) and (2a) respectively. The LogFrankRom variable has a positive sign
in (2a) and a negative sign in (2b) and is statistically significant in neither. The dummy
variables for Latin America, Asia, and Subsaharan Africa are negative but only
statistically significant in (2b).
Examining the results for equations (3a) and (3b), one can see that both
lnSchool65 and lnInv6095 are both positive in sign in both estimations, but only
education is statistically significant. Both Statehist and ICRGE80 are positive and
statistically significant when entered separately. LogFrankRom is negative in sign, but is
not statistically significant. The Latin American dummy variable is negative and
statistically significant in both formulations. Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia are negative
and statistically negative only in (3b).
Examining the results for equations (4a) and (4b), one finds that lnInv6095 is
positive, but it is statistically significant only in (4a). LogFrankRom is negative, but is

17

not statistically significant in either estimation. The Statehist and ICRGE80 variables are
both positive and statistically significant when entered separately. The Latin America
dummy variable is negative and statistically significant in both formulations, while SubSaharan Africa is negative and statistically significant in (4b).
At this point one might wonder if the results discussed above are influenced by
the poor data quality for the measures of technology in agriculture for the 1960s. In order
to explore this possibility, equations (1a), (1b), (2a), (2b), (3a), and (3b) were all reestimated using values for fertilizer intensity and fertilizer intensity times tractor intensity
for 1975. The results with respect to these variables remain unchanged. Agricultural
technology has a positive, statistically significant effect on growth from 1960 to 1995.
In summary, two sets of variables seem to have had significantly positive effects
on long-term growth: all three versions of the agricultural technology variable and
Statehist/ICRGE80 variables. This implies that improvements in agricultural technology
along with good quality institutions within stable states leads to more rapid economic
growth. In all but one of the formulations LogFrankRom had a negative sign, but it was
never statistically significant. This result is somewhat surprising since there is a large
literature that seems to imply that trade openness not only allows for gains from
comparative advantage (level effects on GDP), but also facilitates the spillover of
technical knowledge (Keller, 2004) from developed to developing countries (raising the
growth rate of GDP). The lack of significance of the trade or openness variable may very
well be due to the fact that trade may allow for the spillover of agricultural knowledge
from country to country (Alston, 2002). Thus trade may lead to increases in GDP growth

18

via improvements in technology utilized. This effect would not be captured by the above
estimations.

Results: Malmquist Productivity
In the previous section three proxy measures for agricultural productivity were
used. The implicit inference was that higher values for these variables represented better
technologies and thus more productive agricultural sectors. A more direct measure is
provided by Trueblood and Coggins (2003). Their paper examines productivity growth
in agriculture for a large sample of nations for the time period 1961 to 1991. Malmquist
productivity indexes, discussed earlier in the paper, are constructed utilizing the nonparametric approach for constructing frontiers. Utilizing these measures equation (1a),
(2a), and (2b) are re-estimated by substituting the Malmquist productivity growth
measures, AgTFP, for the variable lnFert61. The results are presented in Table 4.

As can be seen, in all three estimations the AgTFP is positive, although it is
statistically significant for just two. Economic convergence is supported in all three
formulations. The lnSchool65 variable is positive and statistically significant, whereas
the lnInv6095 while positive is only significant for one estimation. Both Statehist and
ICRGE80 are positive and statistically significant. The trade variable is not significant in
any formulation.

An alternative set of data on agricultural productivity is provided in Ludena, et al.
(2005).2 Their paper examines productivity growth in agriculture for a large sample of
nations for the time period 1961 to 2000. It too constructs Malmquist productivity
indexes which are multifactor measures of productivity change. Utilizing these
measures, equations (1a), (2a), and (2b) are re-estimated by substituting the Malmquist
productivity measures from Ludena, et al. (2005) for the variable lnFert61. The growth
rate of GDP per capita now represents the average growth rate from 1960 to 2000
(GR6000) while the investment variable now represents average investment also for the
period 1960 to 2000 (lnInv6000). The results of these estimations are presented in Table
5.

Table 5 goes here

As can be seen, in all three estimations the AgTFP variable is both positive and
statistically significant. Again agricultural productivity is important for growth. It
appears that economic convergence is supported in all three formulations. Both the
lnSchool65 and the lnInv6000 are also positive and statistically significant. Thus
improved education and increased investment enhance growth in the long-run. In
addition, both Statehist and ICGRE80 have positive signs and are statistically significant,
which implies that good institutions and states enhance growth. However, the
LogFrankRom remains insignificant, which indicates that perhaps trade’s effect on
growth may not be direct, but may operate through its impact on productivity.

Results: Human Development Index
The next step in the analysis is to shift focus to a broader definition of
development and to see how agricultural modernization has affected the general wellbeing of a country. So far the focus had been on factors that have an impact on economic
growth. Now the analysis moves on to test how much impact agricultural technology and
productivity might have had on human development itself. As mentioned in the previous
section, the recent literature has found significant connections between the agricultural
sector and poverty reduction, increases in social welfare or reduction in morbidity, etc.
These measures of well-being are perhaps best captured by human development as
measured by the Human Development Index (HDI) constructed by the UNDP. In order to
analyze this relationship between human welfare or development and agricultural
modernization, the dependent variable used in Tables 2, 3, and 4 is replaced with the
average of the HDI index from 1975 to 1995. Accordingly, the next set of results is based
on estimates of Equations (5a) and (5b) and are presented in Table 6.3 In addition,
AgTFP, as developed by Trueblood and Coggins (2003), is utilized as a measure of
agricultural productivity (the last column in Table 6). Finally, the lnGDP60 is no longer
included since the HDI index also includes a measure of per capita GDP.

Table 6 goes here

In a number of ways the above results echo the results for economic growth
presented in Tables 3, 4, and 5, especially with respect to agricultural technology and
productivity. These show that agricultural technology/productivity is a causal factor for

21

improved well-being as well as for economic growth. The investment variable is also
positive and statistically significant across all estimations. Institutional quality also
seems to have a robust, positive, and statistically significant effect on well being.
Openness (LogFrankRom) does not seem to have an influence on the Human
Development index. The regional dummy variables for Asia and Subsaharan Africa are
negative and, for the most part, statistically significant. The Latin American dummy is
positive and statistically significant. The above equations were also estimated using
Statehist as a substitute for ICRGE80. The results for the agricultural
technology/productivity variables remain unchanged.
One might argue that including the AgTFP measure of productivity might
introduce multicollinearity between the dependent variable, the average value of HDI for
1975 to 1995, and the independent variable (AgTFP). That is, human capital is a
component of the HDI measure and improved human capital is also likely to increase
AgTFP. However, the important thing to note is that the results do not change
dramatically when AgTFP is introduced as a substitute for lnFert61 and lnModern61.
One would have expected that if multicollinearity existed, there would be a dramatic
change in the results. Additionally, several tests of multicollinearity revealed no evidence
of multicollinearuty between the two variables.4
The results presented in the tables point to the importance of agricultural
technology or agricultural modernization as a causal factor for economic growth and the
well-being of the population. The paper began by asking the following questions. Is the
modernization of agriculture an important determinant of overall growth? Is this effect
robust to the inclusion of other variables? Given the non-traditional roles for agriculture,

22

does agricultural modernization have a significant impact on human development? Is this
impact robust to the inclusion of other variables? Now these can be answered.
Modernization of agriculture is an important determinant of overall growth and it is
robust to the inclusion of other variables. In addition, agricultural modernization does
have a significant impact on the level of human development and this relationship, like
the previous one, is robust to the inclusion of other variables.

Summary and Conclusions
In theorizing about long-run growth and development, agriculture seemed to
disappear from the literature and ceased to play an important role after the development
of dualistic models in the 1950s and 1960s. However, recently there has been a reemergence of interest and a reconsideration of the importance of agriculture in the
development process with a number of models being constructed which incorporate
agriculture. These models and the theories they propose find agriculture in general and
agricultural technology in particular to play a critical role in long-run growth and
development.
An empirical analysis of agriculture’s role in economic growth and development
was undertaken in this paper. In particular, this paper analyzes the importance of a
modernized agricultural sector for economic growth and development. Agricultural
technology, as applied in this paper, is defined four different ways. Three of these
represent proxy measures for agricultural productivity with the first measuring fertilizer
intensity, the second fertilizer and tractor intensity, and the third including human capital
as well as measures of fertilizer and tractor intensity. Using these proxy measures of

23

agricultural productivity in the early 1960s the empirical results indicate that improved
agricultural technology in the 1960s had a significant, positive influence on growth from
1960 to 1995. The fourth is a more direct measure of productivity. It is a Malmquist
index measure of total factor productivity measured for two time periods, 1961 to 1991
and 1961 to 2000. It too is found to have a statistically significant positive influence on
long-term growth.
The results reaffirmed the conclusions drawn from previous analysis concerning
investment spending, education, and measures of institutional quality. That is, the work
of Knack and Keefer (1995) and Bockstette, et al. (2002) indicated that institutional
quality and state antiquity were both important factors in long-run growth. The results of
this paper reaffirm these results. In addition, investment and human capital also seem to
be important factors in long-run growth, thus reaffirming previous empirical work on
growth theory (Jones, 2002). In addition to these variables, it seems that agricultural
technology, also played an important role in economic growth.
The above analysis was repeated utilizing the human development index as the
dependent variable. The hypothesis was that improved technology or modernization of
the agricultural sector improves well being. Indeed, the measures of agricultural
modernization seem to have statistically significant positive effects on human
development.
The results of this paper complement the recent theoretical work incorporating the
agricultural sector into multi-sector growth models. These theories indicate that
historical, long-run growth was dependent on the growth of agricultural productivity via

24

agricultural modernization. These theoretical conclusions are supported by the empirical
work presented here.

Originally these equations were estimated using as a measure of openness the
variable exports plus imports divided by GDP. The results, for the other
variables of the model, were very similar to those reported here using the
measure developed by Frankel and Romer (1999). The latter is thought to be
a more appropriate measure given the endogeneity issues connected with the
trade share measure. Ideally, as noted previously in the paper, an instrumental
variables analysis would be carried out. However, finding good instruments
for the other variables in the analysis would be very difficult.

The reader will note that lnAgModern61 is not utilized as a measure of
agricultural technology. This is due to the fact that this variable includes a
measure of schooling. See the earlier discussion of equation (5b).

4.

There was no evidence of pair-wise correlation. The R squared value of
regression of HDI and AgTFP was only 0.29. Additionally, residual tests for
autocorrelation and partial correlation of the equation with HDI and AgTFP
showed no evidence of correlation. Tests of tolerance level and variance
inflation factor based on the value of the R squared obtained from the above
regression did not indicate presence of multicollineaarity. Additionally,
centering was done by transforming the AgTFP values and the HDI values by
subtracting the mean value from each case and then running the regression

30

with the centered values. This did not change the results in any significant
manner.
