CHAPTER 1

Resilience for Innovation – A Research Agenda
Hugo Pinto
Teresa de Noronha

Introduction
Last decade is characterized by different types of crises and shocks in the socioeconomic
systems, creating a turbulent context and calling for a better understanding of what the dynamic
perspective of change is. For countries, regions and cities a better understanding of governace
urges and calls for action.
Resilience is gaining attention in social sciences, in general, and in regional studies, in
particular. The concept has been particularly useful to rethink regional development models
in the European Union when integrating the contribution of innovative dynamics in regional
strategies and also in considering prevention and planning environmental, socio-economic and
technological risks.
Resilience is commonly characterized by having an engineering perspective, if focusing the
return to a steady-state equilibrium, and an ecological perspective, if paying more attention
to the carrying capacity of the system as it absorbs shocks without losing its properties
(Simmie & Martin, 2010). Today’s use of the “resilience” metaphor in social sciences requires
careful considerations to avoid frequent fuzzy meanings (Davoudi et al., 2012). The Evolutionary
Economic Geography School suggests connecting the concept to ideas that allow reflecting
how different socio-economic systems at different scales are able of withstanding, recovering,
re-orientating and renewing themselves when confronted with external disruptions or internal
systemic failures. In this way resilience is being debated integrating an evolutionary approach
(Boschma, 2015) and demonstrating how complex systems adapt and evolve. The vision of
complex adaptive systems is very rich as it facilitates to clarify the emergent characteristics at
multi-level interactions (Cooke, 2012), uncovering, for example, the mechanisms that enable
top-down and bottom-up change linking territories at different levels, with systems and
networks, with specific organisations, their behaviours, routines and incentives. It is clear that
resilience, and regional resilience in particular, require effective innovation systems (Simmie,
2014) as innovation is a central aspect of the adaptation and adaptability of territories. The
micro-determinants of resilience are crucial, connected with the dynamic capabilities of
organizations (Teece, 1999).
For resilience consideration, the Public Sector plays a crucial role. The State has a crucial
role in the coordination and governance of market exchange and it is central to create the
institutional architectures that create advantages in some cases (Hall & Thelen, 2009). The State
11

is an inducer of innovation and new activities, both by supporting and enforcing new legislation
but also by public procurement, acquiring products that stimulate other economic agents
(Uyarra et al. 2013).

Organization of the book
This book is a contribution to the debate of resilience applied to the Portuguese case.
Organized in eight chapters, several contributions from the Portuguese reality are gathered on
topics such as the definition of policies for resilient territories, supply networks of public services,
innovation in enterprises. Knowledge management in the tourist industry, resilience in rural
areas, urban regeneration strategies, and technological learning as an organizational resilience
mechanism are explored as well.
After the introductory chapter, in chapter 2 Luís Grave underlines that the development
of complex urban systems is subject to various factors influenced by the objectives of the
established territorial policies or urban development agents. There are potential risks and
impacts of land use in result of external factors adverse to set goals and desired dynamics. It
is necessary to prevent and overcome these harmful effects through adaptive management of
land use management able to anticipate and consider preventively, possible future scenarios
contraries to set development strategies and set safer development goals or adopting strategic
adjustment measures in order to avoid harmful dynamic of the constant balancing of the urban
system. How to configure this management is the challenge. As a starting point and basis for
this approach, the author found an area on the south bank of the Tagus estuary suffering from
a context of stagnation after an abrupt stop of the rapid urban growth that was occurring,
induced by construction of the ‘Vasco da Gama Bridge’. From the impacts on land use this
chapter went to seek the necessary responses in terms of mechanisms and procedures that
should be included in land management so that it can avoid such adverse effects. In the end,
it identifies the potential benefits that could result, if applied in the same context, through the
proposed adaptive land use management system model.
Chapter 3 by Ricardo Tomé, José Afonso Teixeira and Margarida Pereira debates the relevance
of public services which due to their universal and inclusive character mitigate social inequalities,
foster economic growth and bring populations and territories closer, also making them more
resilient and cohesive. In Portugal, after restoring a democratic regime (1974), joining the EEC/EU
(1986) and, at a different level, information and communication technological innovation, have
contributed to the expansion and modernisation of public services. The extension of compulsory
schooling and the opening of access to higher education, the creation of the National Health
Service and the democratisation of justice have required expanding the respective networks
of facilities, technological innovation and suitable training. Public administrative services have
been restructured, formats diversified, technology incorporated and networks integrated.
Neoliberalism and the economic and financial crisis (2008) weakened the Welfare State through
the sub-contracting of services, rationalisation of resources, defence of contracting models
and privatisation. This chapter reflects on the role of public services in territorial resilience
and cohesion, showing the changes in the public services for education, health, justice and

administration in Portugal and some reorganization consequences of the crisis. Based on three
case studies, it also analyses patterns of the use of services in different geographical contexts
(densely urbanised, rural and transition territories).
In chapter 4 Sílvia Fernandes, Marisa Cesário, Bruno Jesus and José Monteiro Barata identify
the sectors of the Portuguese economy that most participate in cooperation to innovate and
which sources/agents are most used in the process, observed by sector and type of innovation.
Using the data from the Community Innovation Survey (CIS-2012), it first appraises the nature of
the innovation process in terms of cooperation or firm-based innovation, and then differentiates
the results by sector illustrating which cooperation sources/agents are most used (scope) and
relative intensity (scale). The results suggest that main innovating sectors in the Portuguese
economy are research-based, knowledge-based, and service-based. The external sources/agents
most commonly used by the first are universities, suppliers by the second and firms’ group by
the third. Private customers are important sources in general, what means that Portuguese
firms use customers’ information and market relations for innovation purposes. These results
are in line with the fact that Portuguese firms are mainly small and medium-sized (SME) and
increasingly focused on services and knowledge.
Carolina Alves, Adélia Nunes and Joana Silva describe the case of Serra da Estrela in chapter
5. As a mountainous area, characterized by low density of population with an eccentric position,
remote and associated to physical and natural constraints, the construction of more resilient
territories can become a path towards the stimulation of development. The main issue of this
work is to understand in what way the fixing of specific business constitutes a structuring
element of social and ecological resilience. Through the valorization of human resources
and improvement of potentialities of this territory such as local products, environment and
landscape, the widening and diversification of the offer arises. However, bottlenecks are still to
be considered such as the non-convergence with other local business hinders the creation of a
more cohesive, competitive and resilient territory.
Chapter 6, by Bernadete Dias Sequeira, João Filipe Marques and António Serrano, presents
some of the main results of a research about knowledge management in the hospitality
organisations in the Algarve region. Its main goal is to understand, from a sociological
perspective, how hotels create or acquire, retain, share and use their organizational knowledge.
A comprehensive model of analysis providing an integrated overview of knowledge management
was specially developed for this goal. The model is organized around two analytical axes: the first
identifies the main steps of the knowledge management process (creation/acquisition, storage,
transfer and use) and the second lists and describes the management practices that facilitate
this process. Given that innovation is a very important outcome of knowledge management
as a whole, this chapter focus on the last dimension, the use of organizational knowledge.
The empirical research consists in three case studies of hotel groups operating in the Algarve,
using semi-structured interviews to the hotel’s managing staff and a survey administered to a
stratified sample of employees.
In chapter 7, Célia Marisa Fonseca Ferreira, Teresa Sá Marques and Paula Guerra underline
that the structure and organization of economy of cities results from both individual actions
of many economic agents (individuals, families, business, government institutions, diversified
organizations) and from the network of relationships established between them. The authors
13

used 24 interviews to retail sector business promoters and economic-oriented initiatives
developers, carried out during 2015, to understand the motivations, expectations and difficulties
involved in opening of business or conducting initiatives, the location factors, the partnerships
and institutional support, as well as aspects related to innovation in the city centre of Oporto.
This analysis contributes to the studies of bottom-up initiatives in the context of economic
development, and thus support the delineation of private sector strategies as well as help to
support delineation of public policies.
In the final chapter 8, Teresa Noronha and Victoria Del Pino emphasize the need for going
back to the classical methods of considering the savings that repetitive processes introduce
in the learning process of firms. Cumulative experience leads to performance improvement
and may fill part of the existing knowledge gap based upon the Experience Curve (EC). The
Microalgae Production Systems (MPS) was used for this research considering that it is one
of the most exciting future-oriented business areas of modern biotechnologies, which have
turned into an important global industry, with a diversified field of applications. Thus, the
particularities of learning and experience accumulation processes have been used to conclude
about the behaviour variations of the EC, by exploring and detecting some applications and
misapplications of the concept. The research methodology is based on the case-study of Necton
S.A., a pioneer Portuguese firm, dedicated, since 1997, to microalgae cultivation. Prior to this
chapter, an in deep research of these authors attempted to understand the technical complexity
of microalgae biotechnology. The conclusions emphasized in this chapter confirm that: i) the
different MPS follow an experience curve, with progress ratios which are in between the ones
determined for manufacturing firms and energy technologies; ii) the learning mechanisms play
a similar role through the technologies life-cycle, although the MPS studied are different in
technological complexity; and, finally and most important, iii) learning-by-doing is more relevant
in early technology stages, learning-by-using appears to be fundamental in the maturity stage,
and learning-by-searching is critical to solve particular technical constraints. This perception is
very useful in the design of target strategies for innovation under constrains such as financial
disruptive or economically lagging environments.

that are entrepreneurial and enhacers of knowledge production and exchenage (Balland,
Suire, & Vicente, 2013), the policies for stimulating a smart specialisation (Foray, David,
& Hall, 2011) and the capabilities of firms and other key innovation actors (OECD, 2009).
•	 Resilience and risk – shocks and internal disruptions need to be addressed. The studies
of risk management, especially relevant in urban and territorial physical planning, will
include necessarily new dimensions of socio-economic and technological resilience
(Alexander, 2013; Allan & Bryant, 2012; Dawley, Pike, & Tomaney, 2010).
•	 Resilience and territorial renewal – territories are living organisms that develop and
grow but may also degenerate and die. Policy-makers and research will pay particular
attention to the mechanisms that can increase the life-cycle of specific clusters (Ebbekink
& Lagendijk, 2013), that can increase the competitiveness and cohesion of economic base
(Bristow, 2010), increase proximity and related variety (Frenken, Van Oort, & Verburg,
2007), and stimulate the factors of uniqueness and that guarantee a long-standing place
in the global economy.
The book hopes to contribute to the consolidation of the concept of resilience, both in
scientific research and territorial planning. Useful to researchers and students, it supplies a
diversified and balanced selection of cases related to management and promotion of territorial
development in difficult conditions. Portuguese regional reality exposed and discussed in deep,
thus, became a promising field of study per se.

A research agenda
It is expected that different types of shocks, socio-economic, demographic, technological,
environmental, financial, will accelerate, uncovering the deficits and structural problems of
contemporary society. Resilience can become a critical area of research related to risk management
and facilitating the deep comprehension and intervention in a changing environment. The
results presented in this book confirm the fast-growing literature in the topic, highlighting three
relevant fields for the Resilience research agenda:
•	 Resilience and innovation - studying how innovation increases at a multi-level perspective
the resilience of different systems. This will necessarily include the studies of different
national configurations that are more friendly and supportive of innovation (Amable
& Lung, 2008), different systems and network configurations that create eco-systems

The urban system is a permanent complex construction, with the aim of conditioning
society, its culture and activities more susceptible to various influences and constraints. Induced
dynamics occur within its development, determined both by prior planning, and by unforeseen
and adverse externalities to thought out plans, leading to instabilities or even processes with a
negative tendency. This was the case with the recent economic and financial crisis which resulted
in a context of stagnation or even recession for urban development in the consolidated city and
the urban space in expansion or consolidation. The findings here are reflected in the following
statement of amazement: could it be that nobody foresaw this, and why? It is my belief that it
indeed matters that policy in general and spatial planning as governance of cities acquires the
capacity to foresee, as far as possible, the distant consequences of its own decisions and the
effects of externalities on urban development, that is, that for a sustainable and resilient urban
development, this can be carried out using a permanently adapted strategy for a preventive and
not merely positivist prospective.
However, the city, from the territorial point of view, consists of an urban system with a
complex multifunctionality and structure. Therefore, in order to achieve the aforementioned
governance of sustainable and resilient cities, this should be supported by a management system
capable of efficiently managing that complexity. However, either due to the inefficiency of its
practices or due to the ineffectiveness of its results, it can be seen that territorial management
has shown itself unable to anticipate and monitor the mutability of urban systems (forms and
functions) induced by actual transformation dynamics. The positivist planning that has lasted
has failed, since it is based on policies and instruments managed segmentally and sectorally,
where the definition of strategies does not correspond to a prior systematic assessment, as well
as the definition of strategies not corresponding to actions undertaken, showing, through the
disconnected state of the environment and the functioning urban systems, that it is urgent to
have a management system supported by planning based on a prior systematic assessment of
the contexts which are the object of management action.

Objectives and organizational structure
The growing complexity of urban systems requires approaches which traditional planning
has not provided. To respond to the complexity, uncertainty and risks brought about by
globalization and technological progress, studies involving the future, scenarios and strategic
planning have been seen by some as a viable alternative, increasingly used as creative and
cooperative basis for decision making processes (Bina et al., 2014).
Therefore, the challenge is: how to design and operationalize planning/territorial management instruments and processes capable of regulating and managing the development of urban
spaces in a balanced and sustainable manner, despite uncertainties and adversities, i.e. resilient
urban development?
Our starting point is the impacts, i.e. in spatial planning (SP) in a case study within a
context of stagnation after induced accelerated urban growth, for which there is a need to
find responses to the resulting challenge faced there. Starting from theories of self-regulated
strategic planning, a search for innovative aspects is carried out through a holistic approach,
within the fields of planning for uncertainty, the concepts of integrated strategic management
and management performance evaluation, applied to sustainable urban planning, seeking
concepts and techniques which constitute a territorial management (TM) model endowed
with adaptive planning. The conclusion will summarize the benefits which can follow from the
proposals developed.

Tagus estuary. This was therefore, another typical case of urban expansion caused by road
infrastructure.
The phenomenon of expansion was expected and even desired, so the local municipalities,
when developing the respective municipal master plans (MMP), which determined the
classification of land use, envisaged large perimeters of areas to be urbanised. The Government
established a capital gains tax on the land and real estate markets, justified by the national
investment which had occurred. We then saw that the actual administration implemented
policies which, supposedly justifiable by local development and public budgetary sustainability,
promoted and even focused on stimulating urban expansionism. However, the process of
growth and consolidation was still taking place when the global economic crisis occurred and
stagnation of that growth occurred with negative reflexes of a varied order on the environmental,
economic and financial conditions of a fragmented and unfinished urban space.
The context described can be seen as one of the main case studies relevant to the support
framework analysis for the design of the MT system model that has been developed here. To
do this it has been necessary to focus observations on the urban centres of Alcochete, Montijo
and Pinhal Novo (Fig. 1) which are the closest agglomerations to the first access points from the
IP1-A12 (south side of the Vasco da Gama Bridge) and in which the urban boom caused by the
new infrastructure was most notable.
Figure 1 – Location of urban perimeters under analysis

A case of urban stagnation and diseconomy
Contextualization of the case study
Since it joined the European Union (former EEC), Portugal witnessed a huge boost in its
infrastructure and territorial facilities. As regards infrastructure, road links improved the most.
The only connection of Lisbon with the south of the country was made using the 25 de Abril
Bridge, and this needed to be strengthened along with accessibilities to the Lisbon Universal
Exhibition, which was held in 1998. As such, the construction of the Vasco da Gama Bridge from
the location of Expo 98 completed the second connection of Lisbon to the southern motorway,
crossing the south-east sector of the southern side of the metropolitan area, which was then
marginal compared to the central element (Lisbon), only connected by river transport routes
and with an urban occupation made up of small-sized consolidated urban agglomerations of a
somewhat predictable size.
Given the singular circumstances of that situation and the magnitude of the investment,
the initiative to construct the Vasco da Gama Bridge was taken significantly in advance and
was highly mediatized. This was a time of urban expansion and increasing mobility through
individual transportation. So, as was expected, with this new access to that subregion having
been implemented, there was an impulse in the market for land and real estate in the urban
centres located close to the first local accesses to this new link between the two banks of the

This reflection is based on the analysis and confrontation between municipal management
models (instruments and practices) used in different examples of a paradigmatic case study,
assessing them and correlating them with the respective effects on spatial management and
environmental and economic sustainability. Thus, the relation between the phenomenon
of urban growth with different MT practices and the urban action carried out in the urban
perimeter of Alcochete, Montijo and Pinhal Novo were observed, seeking to identify the trends,
planning, mid-term planning and programming, that formed factors which led to the systemic
anomalies which shaped the territory in those economic and financial circumstances.

products of urbanised space; (iii) Infrastructure and urbanisation works in general, constructed or
under construction, not used or not finished for an indeterminate time; (iv) Structural mismatches
in the provision of facilities and functions or services involving collective use – not consolidated in
certain urban areas with the facilities built being oversized regarding needs, indefinitely, others
without such facilities due to a lack of justification to construct the planned facilities.
Figure 2 – Illustration of trends

The trends observed in the case study
Below the evidence identified in the examples analysed will be presented, systematising the
trends observed in the MT performance.
Trends in the planning and programming of the urban space: (i) Planning with weak support
concerning vision and strategic weighting; (ii) Over sizing of the space to be urbanised, at the
expense of rehabilitation and bridging urbanised spaces – disqualification, fragmentation,
dispersion; (iii) The widespread absence of detailed plans and other forms of urban programming;
(iv) When partial use was made of PP, as happened in one of the examples analysed, there
were notable contrasts in the quality coherence between the spaces developed in a distinct
manner; (v) Generalised negligence regarding the financial plans in the territorial management
instruments (TMI), particularly more demanding in the UP and PP, generally not present when
assessing their economic viability; (vi) Poor use of the land to be urbanised, less than 50%, after
15 years following the approval of the MDP; (vii) The urban growth was as large as close to this
(equal trend in the slowing of the construction space).
Trends in the effects inherent to the control and management practices for urban
implementation: (i) Reduced use of programming and urban conciliation mechanisms; (ii)
Reduced use of management methods and urban operation control mechanisms; (iii) Lack of
consideration of externalities related to land market trends and urban real estate products; (iv)
Indefinitely fragmented urban shape; (v) Structural anomalies in the allocation of facilities and
public spaces; (vi) Excess infrastructure, without users, for an indefinite period.
The resulting trends of economic and financial management practices: (i) Absence of
preventive assessment of the economic viability of municipal planning in general, urban plans
and operations; (ii) Weak or absent linking between the municipal budget/investment and the
municipal territorial management plans; (iii) Mismatch between the structure of the municipal
accounting (POCAL) and the structure of the territorial/sectoral management system for urban
development, making financial/budgetary control and management more difficult; (iv) Chronic
budgetary deficit, with a cyclical dynamic co-related to local authority mandates, motivated
by systematised budgetary regulation; (v) Difficulties of budget appropriation aimed at the
development of the urban space, in competition with other sectors involving municipal activity,
in the financial distribution of activity plans and the municipal budget.
The resulting trends for externalities: (i) Stagnation of urbanisation and construction; (ii)
Surplus: housing stock vacant, supply of urban lots, expected urban land plots and subsequent

What went wrong and why - an overview
Given the stated tendencies, let us now draw conclusions from what has failed, trying to
identify probable explanations, especially when dealing with tendencies contradictory to the
supposed objectives of the SM public policies and the formal TM system. Thus, the following
have failed: (i) the SM and environmental sustainability policies, in the management of the urban
21

space where fragmentation and structural incoherence have been seen, as well as excessive
consumption of land and negative environmental impacts, both because the new spaces were
not consolidated and because the conservation of the consolidated spaces was neglected,
resulting in the subsequent deterioration of the urban structures and the environment as well as
a lack of coordination and imbalances in collectively used functions or services; (ii) social policies
regarding housing and services to the community since the fragility of urban development
control left certain constitutional guarantees vulnerable such as the right to housing since access
to this was made difficult or impossible for the population due to high prices and frequently
inadequate localisation; health and education since suitable appropriation for the respective
facilities in situ, with the right capacity and at the right moments, was made more difficult; the
right environment and quality of urban life faced with a disconcerting “work site atmosphere”
and deterioration of the residential and working spaces; (iii) the economic and financial policies
inherent to urban development, thus generating persistent or cyclical situations of both
functional and budgetary deseconomy and even that of financial non-sustainability.
The fundamental reasons that we have concluded to be at the basis of these performance
failures in the TM system may be summarised as follows: (i) Belief by the regulatory authority
that urbanisation can be undertaken through territorial management instruments (TMI) when,
in fact, it is mostly undertaken by direct urban operation without prior urban programming;
(ii) Reduced use of TMI in detail and in terms of an operating programme, since it is believed
that the municipal master plans will be sufficient, without a strategy including a preventive and
prospective element and without a programme which considers management techniques and
control of the urban growth process; (iii) Despite the TM system establishing and undertaking
regular assessment of the state of the territory and the system indicating execution of plans,
this has rarely happened. On the other hand, there is a notorious lack of critical assessment
regarding the performance of the TM system itself, especially where the complexity of urban
systems requires more efficient management, in the cities.
However, based on the same public policies and the same TM system, cases have been
observed which show apparently positive results and which have become reference examples,
perhaps as a result of best territorial management practices but also counting on the help of
favourable circumstances, which demonstrates that the formal system is, indeed, susceptible to
personal strategies or attitudes of the actors, that is, it needs to be complemented with a safe
guide which reduces the margin of randomness and error in territorial management practices.

The state of spatial planning at the local level
In the tradition of urban management and planning practices, the plans have been limited,
in general, to a classification of action and qualification of the urban land, followed by the policy
action of use and occupation of land according to urban parameters established in the MDP,
not proposing procedures involving systematic programming of urban development as well as
controlled and preventive monitoring in the carrying out of this.
On the other hand, although the detailed planning translates into more concrete and
objective urban proposals, enabling prior environmental assessment and public participation,
Innovation for Resilience

the typical delay and its mandatory format leads to its rejection most of the time, which endows
it with an asymmetric or even rare character. It tends to be adopted only to fit in with the
construction of a large facility or even a large urban or industrial development, through need
to alter the MMP. In this way, planning almost exclusively through the MMP has served mainly
to open/classify new areas to be urbanised but not in a way which has been thought out
and adjusted to needs, therefore devoid of the progressive phasing of their implementation
and remaining dependent on the initiative of their promoters. After having experienced the
development and implementation cycle for first-generation MMPs, the reality shows that the
MMP is insufficient for territorial and urban management.
Indeed, relating the dynamics and volume of production of urban space through private
initiative with the tiny number of municipal urban plans, it can be assumed that urban
development is rarely carried out in a coordinated and cohesive manner. Given the lack of
the necessary political effort and management planning and proactivity, utilising an integrated
vision endowed with a strategy, urban development is confined to the logics and interests
of urban agents and land, real estate and financial markets, ending up, sooner or later, with
this leading to environmental and functional imbalances and to accentuated systemic financial
diseconomies. In fact, it is within this framework that one finds such a state of (lack of) planning
and (non) sustainability of the territory. Planning and management of land use cannot be
ignored in this structural context, with the risk of questioning its creditability.

The territorial management system and its contradictions
Given the objectives of this approach, I will now summarize the structure of the TM (TMS)
system formally established in Portugal regarding municipal intervention, in terms of the
territorial management legal system (TMLS). According to the legal framework of the system,
we can group the territorial management instruments within the municipal area into three levels,
structured in the following manner: (i) At the strategic level: the Municipal Master Plan (MMP),
the Urbanisation Plan (UP) and the Territorial Action Programme (TAP), not forgetting the report
of the state of spatial planning (RSSP) as an assessment-diagnostic instrument system; (ii) At
the level of operative regulation for implementation and for urban programming: the municipal
regulation for urbanisation and building (MRUB), the planning and management operative unit
(PMOU), the Detailed Plan which can take on various formats, due to its specific or simplified
nature, the implementation unit (IU), the urban regeneration programme (URP), etc.; (iii) At
the level of implementation: the subdivision operation (SO) and the urban operations (UO) of
allotment, urbanisation and building.
For the objective in question, in accordance with Grave (2009) and based on empirical
recognition from praxis, we will list some contradictions found between what the legal system
establishes for the plans and what in fact happened in practice planning and implementation:
•	 The TMS establishes that municipal plans must comply with a strategic reference
framework and the supramunicipal instruments (PNPOT, PROT, etc.) define strategic
or regulatory guidelines that should be included in the municipal plans, but they are
not, indefinitely, in conformity with that referenced and poorly define a vision and

development strategy with concrete and well-formulated objectives, nor goals and
indicators regarding implementation;
The TMS lays down that municipal plans should form part of the financial and
implementation programme, but the actual TMLS classifies these as elements
accompanying the plan, as if they do not form an intrinsic part of the latter, thus ending
up having a pro forma nature and so becoming undervalued by agents when drawing
these up (promoting body, technical team, monitoring committee) and, furthermore, in
their use (land authorities, management team) when implementing the plan;
The TMS is based on the TMI but urban growth prevails through asymmetric urban
operations, even with a large scale and impact, not subject to prior detailed planning or
programming, thus making processes quicker and less complicated, which is facilitated
by the (lack of) connection between the TMLS and the EULS, making a rule of what
should be an exception;
The TMS provides for the establishment of implementation units as an implementation
mechanism for programmed urbanisation but do not concretely and objectively specify
their programming requirements and the documental organisation of that instrument,
merely laying down that the IU may or should be listed within the UOPG, detailed plan
(DP) or in any place, leading to this important instrument not being used;
The TMS provides for a typology of grounds for refusing intended urban operations but
its explanation is reproduced in the plans and ongoing management made based on the
vague, non-specific typology contained in the EULS;
The TMS determines the application of systems involving indicators and the monitoring
of the state of the territory (RSSP, network observations, etc.), essential for a more
preventive and timely planning, but it is mainly absent and there is no registration and
public dissemination of that instrument.

However, the difficulties of territorial planning are felt internationally, even in countries with
extensive experience and a sense of innovation in this area. A systematised assessment concerning
local territorial planning practices in the United Kingdom (Department for Communities and
Local Government, Spatial Plans in Pratice: Supporting the reform of local planning – Final
Report, London, 2008), confirmed this idea and from this some of its conclusions have been
extracted and translated into the following necessities: (i) More plans as instruments to manage
change but with a long-term strategic approach; (ii) Plans drawn up and managed based on
assessment proven by data and evidence; (iii) Plans drawn up in partnership with and including
the greater involvement of stakeholders from the various sectors in the same territorial area;
(iv) Suitability recruitment and professional training providing planning professionals with new
competences (data, analysis, creativity and facilitation, project management, implementation
and assessment); (v) Responsibility for drawing up territorial plans should be attributed to
multidisciplinary teams placed in a central position within the local authority and not within
one department.

On the need for adaptive territorial management
(Un)regulated urban growth, its (dis)equilibria and (dis)economies
The model of the Fordist industrial city, marked by a compact and solid structure, was
reconfigured with the coming of the tertiary sector of the economy, the generalisation of
the road infrastructure and the increased degree of motorisation, with two types of urban
occupation coexisting, namely one supported by public transportation, favouring a concentration
along the routes served and their immediate surroundings, fostering high densities and multifamily typologies; another based on the motor car, encouraging a distended and fragmented
occupation, marked by deficient linking of the urban fabric which was not very well structured,
with multiple uses and varied typologies. The city limits gradually extended and took on
ever more imprecise contours. These dynamics affected the compact consolidated city, the
population, employment and functions which went down and also physically deteriorated.
Extensive urban occupation demands resources and mobility, while stimulating “urban waste”
(early withdrawal from urban fabrics with facilities, and multiplication of new infrastructures
which remain indefinitely underused (Pereira, 2009). For that reason, this is challenged in the
light of the principles of sustainability.

Considering the Lisbon Metropolitan area (LMA) as a paradigmatic example, the 2011
Census showed the continuation of previous trends in the reduction in the number of residents
in the city centre and growth in the municipalities of the periphery, along with average ageing
in Lisbon and average rejuvenation in the periphery. These trends have occurred for around two
decades, as a result of a combination of factors of a varied nature, both in economic and financial
terms as well as sociological, but where governance action plays its part. The city of Lisbon has
had differentiated growth dynamics within it. The city expanded its administrative limits despite
25

not expecting more than just maintaining its 2001 demographic level. The bordering crown and
related axes to the north and west of Lisbon along with the southern river arch were the parts
of the metropolitan area of Lisbon, from one side and the other of the Tagus estuary, which
showed themselves as the cause and effect of the main phenomenon of demographic mobility,
which took place within the central nucleus of the metropolitan region.
The accelerated urban growth had, and will have until it attains its utopian consolidation,
characteristics of fragmentation and disconnection, congestion in terms of mobility, asymmetries
in the allocation and quality of public services and environmental conflicts. It was the crown
areas which witnessed the largest population growth in the LMA. On the other hand, the
highways formed the determining factor in terms of the available localisation options and, as
a result, induced the spatial orientation of urban growth. In Figure 3 it is easy to co-relate
the urban growth axes with the major transport infrastructures. The market for the supply of
urban products unveiled opportunities brought about by public investments in accessibilities
and transport and promoted an offer which ensured a strong appetite for demand.
Along with the public investment in accessibilities, urban promoters played their parts in
local accessibilities. However, these promotional initiatives have been random and disconnected
within time and space. Hence it is the case that, despite certain efforts at coordination undertaken
by each municipality, they are far from achieving full cohesion and, at the intermunicipal level,
the disconnection is striking. The actual carrying capacity of the infrastructure and urban service
networks, from the accessibilities and public transport to the supply and sanitation networks,
inherent to the first stages of growth, was overloaded with the subsequent urban and
demographic growths, which was reflected in the increasing congestion, potential breakages or
the quantitative and qualitative insufficiency of services. As for networks of amenities and social
spaces with a collective use, the investment and construction of which, as a rule, did not come
down to the urban promoters, the situation would show itself to be more dramatic and have
devastating economic and financial effects.
This phenomenon of tending towards non-sustainability is contrary to social and urban
cohesion where, as is natural and expectable, certain areas of the city, due to localised dynamics,
have regenerated or even increased their level of quality, generating, in contrast, phenomena
of urban segregation. This tends to produce a city made up of an archipelago of urban areas
of quality, surrounded by deteriorating or run-down urban areas. As a result of these dynamics
from contradictory effects, opposing the trend towards consolidation in the recent city towards
the trend regarding the deterioration in the consolidated city, the installation of a scenario of
duplication of costs can be seen: the first represents the investment effort in its consolidation
of the urban system which is still incomplete; the second represents the investment effort in
the recuperation and regeneration of the consolidated urban fabric which has entered into a
process of decline. It is easy to conclude that a city, seen as an extended shape, functions as
a system of communicating vessels, in which, when load is borne or dynamics are installed in
certain parts, the others will react in a contrary sense, since, in an urban system, effects are not
uniformly distributed, as they depend on sectors and the governance factor.

Innovation for Resilience

The economic and financial issue
The systems referred to raise a fundamental economic and financial question with territorial
impact both from the view of private initiative as well as public initiative. However, it is important
here to highlight the perspective of public initiative at the municipal level, since it is the municipal
management of the territory that is being discussed here.
The municipal management of the territory and the land market are driving and conditioning
factors for the development and the quality of the urban space (Grave, 2000). The urban TM
is played out, from the beginning, in the land market. Various authors recognise that the land
and speculation related to its value are the main drivers of economic and financial crises. What
is certain is that “land prices have been ignored by the economists (...) the fact that the land
remains an obscure and insignificant layer in economic theories leads to these not having the
capacity to predict depressions caused by real estate bubbles” (Gaffney, 2009: 8), quoted by
Henriques (2015: 20).
In fact, the issue of territorial management and dynamics, and in particular the urban
economy, has been brushed off in academic discussion and even in TM praxis. This is due to many
reasons, with the most direct having to do with the absence or opacity of information (data)
which can enable its structured analysis and deeper reasons having to do with the strategies of
the intervening agents and regulators since budgetary constraints restrict the freedom of action
of the actors in accordance with the interests driving them, which is in full conformity with
the neoliberal order of which we form part. However, the context of the current crisis, which
stems from a philosophy of tendential economic deregulation and belief in a permanent growth
dynamics, has led to the emergence of the principle of economic sustainability.
Despite the scarce information made available, through the possible collection of territorial
impact data resulting from municipal budget implementation reports within the LMA, the chart in
Fig. 4 was drawn up which represents the evolution of expenditure and net income for territorial
impact, in average terms, with the necessary adaptations regarding the way the accounts are
structured in line with the Official Plan for Local Administration Accounting (POCAL). In the chart,
taking into consideration practices recognised in the area of municipal budgetary management,
there is evidence of public knowledge, such as the growing and chronic indebtedness of the
municipalities, the recurrent and notorious gap between estimation of revenue and expenses and
between the budget and its implementation as well as the recognised absence of integration of
investments inherent to the territorial plan proposals in the municipal budget.
Looking at the average budget evolution for territorial impact, sampling considered
based on data collected regarding the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, between 2002 and 2011,
the following trends or signs can be observed: (i) evolution of the expenditure amount over
time, predominantly higher than income, resulting in a chronic budgetary deficit; (ii) evolution
of a tendency towards growth, with a drastic reduction in 2006, which is repeated in a less
accentuated manner in 2011, signalling an attempted budgetary rebalancing; (iii) the years in
which that reduction is observed correspond to the start of political mandates.

Among the reasons which are recognised as facilitating these tendencies or cycles are: (i)
the systematic lack of preventive assessment of economic viability of municipal investments
in general and investments earmarked for plans in particular; (ii) the lack of the application
of management and control methodologies which ensure a balanced economic and financial
performance, particularly a prospective approach for planning activities and budget which
takes into account quality information which is sufficiently certain and where the link between
planning and territorial impact has to exist; (iii) in order to implement the conditions described
above the municipal accounting structure (POCAL) has to be linked and made suitable to the
TM sector structures.

for Spatial Planning Policy identifies unplanned urban expansion as one of the problems of
spatial planning. In addition, the Regional Plans for Spatial Planning in force take up the fight
against urban fragmentation and dispersal, through guidance regarding the applicable norms
for municipal plans relating to spatial planning, and, in particular, restricting expansion to needs
resulting from economic and social dynamics in ensuring their programming, and promoting the
reversal of urban perimeters when justified, and restricting building in rural areas. In fact, the
LBOTDU lays down that it is up to the municipalities “to carry out coordinated and programmed
implementation of their territorial planning instruments”. This envisages a set of instruments
to operationalize plans (Cunha, 2012: 283). However, use of programming tools is not the case.
We are led to conclude that the LBPOTU and the TMLS end up having a reduced effect at the
municipal level. These regimes were subject to a recent reformulation which emphasised the
imperative and restrictive nature of those guidelines but, on the date of publication they had
been recently approved or were in the final stages of drawing up most of the MMPs. As a
backwash, most of those plans will remain in force until their future revision (10-year period),
with the extensive underlying spatial models remaining valid.
It is necessary to discuss the validity of the processes as well as the planning and management
instruments in force. It is no longer possible to plan for unrealistic population growth, arguing
for oversized urban perimeters, delegating the urbanisation initiative to the holders of the land,
and keeping local administration with the passive role of regulatory verification. Given the
existing situation, urban development must be guided by three principles: restructuring and
improvement of the fragmented city, regeneration and revitalisation of the consolidated city
and contention of the emerging city, in line with the sustainability of the urban conjuncture as
a whole. But how can this be done?

The management of the complexity of the urban space - which needs
Urban multifunctionality

Spatial management public policies
This framework of concerns has stimulated the search for alternative urban models which are
less predatory on resources (land, energy, landscape, agricultural and forest areas of biodiversity),
supported by a more sustainable mobility. The first proposals arose in the USA with the New
Urbanism (1980s) and later with the Smart Growth and Low Carbon Cities. In Europe, initiatives
have proliferated, associated with Urban Renaissance. In the United Kingdom, a working group
set up by the government (Urban Task Force) produced a reference document (Rogers, 1999); in
the European Union there have been successive guiding documents - Green Book of the Urban
Environment (1990); Aalborg Charter (1994); the Aalborg Commitments (2004), Leipzig Charter
(2007), Toledo Declaration (2010), and Cities of Tomorrow (2011). The guidelines recommend
urban models based on contention at the expense of expansion, in revaluing the concept of
proximity, in multifunctionality and sustainable mobility.
The Framework Law for Spatial and Urban Planning (LBPBOTU) defines principles and
objectives in defence of the new urban paradigm. In the same vein, the National Programme
Innovation for Resilience

The city has numerous plans, availability of resources, social and cultural flair, comfort and
security, the exchange of goods and services, etc. In the meantime, it has been structured and
has become specialised according to living, work, leisure and sociocultural representation. It is
spatially segmented and socially stratified. Specialisation has become second nature to urban
individuals, a trend that has not stopped growing. As Rossi (1982) mentions, the confirmation
of the city is the result of two major systems: that of the city as the product of functional
systems creating its architecture and the city as a spatial structure. Guiomar et al. (2007) states
the following essential characteristics of the urban phenomenon: morphological – the form
of the urban centre; functional – the functions inherent to the urban elements; structural –
those relating to the support structure of urban systems. Each part or element does not exist
alone but within the global system. Therefore, these elements should not be thought of and
managed individually. In short, the urban space is intended to provide, within a structured,
efficient and sustainable form, the environmental, social and economic conditions of comfort
for its citizens.
29

Urban multifunctionality consists of a set of functions housing different functional attributes
of the community. Urban functions must be carried out in a harmonized manner and with a
view to the balanced and lasting satisfaction of ecological functions and the needs of urban
users. They should be organised and structured spatially and functionally as a function of the
hierarchisation of the urban system, suitably multicentred and hierarchised. The European
Commission (1996) recommends the Principle of urban management - urban management
for sustainability is a political process requiring planning and which has an impact on urban
management. The process of sustainable urban management requires a series of instruments
targeted towards ecological, social and economic aspects seeking to provide the necessary
base for their integration. Given this, the TM of complex urban systems should be configured
as a function of the sizes in which the fundamental attributes of the urban space are structured.
According to Grave and Vale (2014), urban multifunctionality may be summarised according
to its social, economic and ecological dimensions, involving the following attributes: (i) Social
dimension – shelter, education, health, culture, leisure, social support; (ii) Economic dimension
– work, trade and services, mobility and connectivity; (iii) Ecological dimension – regulation,
support (Figure 5). The variables of each attribute of the urban system are determined through
the elements (spaces and functional systems) which embody the respective functionalities of
qualities considered most determinant for the satisfaction of the needs and social aspirations
and ecological contingencies and, therefore, those which are critical for the verification of the
respective performance in the systematic strategic assessment procedure.

ment priorities, not always compatible with the priorities of social and territorial cohesion (Vale,
2007). In this context, there have been many recommendations and policy directives for sustainable development as a support for human activities: The Leipzig Charter mentions that “We
strongly support the EU’s Sustainable Development Strategy, (...), with the objective of protecting, strengthening and further developing our cities. In doing so, all dimensions of sustainable
development should be taken into account at the same time and with the same weight. These
include economic prosperity, social balance and a healthy environment. (...) In the long run, cities cannot fulfil their function as engines of social progress and economic growth (...) unless
we succeed in maintaining social balance within and among them, ensuring their cultural diversity and establishing high quality in the fields of urban design, architecture and environment.”

Strategic governance
An urban space is created in five phases: land classification and qualification, availability of
land on the market, land restructuring, creation of infrastructure, and building. In the absence
of control, this would probably take on another order. This progression in creating urban areas is
determinant for the coherence of the urban fabric, although the Administration tends to open/
classify new urban areas without considering needs, not interfering through the programming
of its gradual implementation and being dependent on the initiatives of the promoters.
For effective control of urban development, it is not enough to establish the use of the land
nor the mechanism for the programming of urban land, always susceptible to degeneration
from random external pressure factors. To set the direction of urban growth and prevent the
aforementioned randomness, they can play a strategic role in setting up the infrastructure and
the tactical location of public investments (Henriques, 1990). Other authors follow this logic of
action, such as Pardal et al. (2000), mentioning an active land policy beyond mere urbanisation and
supply of constructed spaces depending on the options of promoters and also that the land to be
urbanised should be established in coordination with the creation of infrastructures for general
services and transport networks defined by the administrative authorities, through concerted
actions of urbanism and infrastructures, urban regeneration and environmental infrastructures.
It is up to the municipalities, as operative managing authorities for urban development, to take
on municipal planning and drive its mediation with socio-economic agents.
Having defined the strategy, the instruments have to be created which, firstly, conceive
the structure and urban form with the objectives in mind and, secondly, contain the operative
mechanisms that will construct the physical system and gradually and effectively reach those
objectives. These mechanisms translate into programming tools (the tactical action), which
prevent potential randomness or interests contrary to the publicly defined strategy. Therefore, so
that the territorial development takes place within sustainable parameters, both from the overall
ecological viewpoint and urban ecology, it is necessary to ensure a controlled urban development
where, while preserving freedom and individual interests, collective interests in terms of patrimony,
the environment and integration and social coexistence can be ensured. An organizational system
for coherent urban development has to be established, supported by a global strategy for the
territory which brings together local interests and wishes with the supramunicipal framework.
31

Thus, in the local TM process, measures should be taken in the following stages of operation:
	
In the strategic plan: (i) Ensure a dynamic of local development, favouring global
management of the urban space preventing cost redundancy, through governance which
is both strategic and operational; (ii) Implement variable urban management regulation for
different territorial areas based on circumstances.
In the regulation plan for agent practices: (i) urban development through prior assessment
of needs, of the management of a land grant for urbanisation and careful planning of the
general infrastructure networks and collective amenities; (ii) Impose the principle that urban
plans and projects should show their economic viability and ensure the programming of their
implementation and funding.
In the sectoral and detailed planning, programming and project implementation: (i)
Focus on the urban projects, plans and sectoral programmes, managed in connection with
the annual activity plan and municipal budget; (ii) Allocate urban programming subject to
the provision of land to be urbanised to the joint assessment of needs and availability in the
consolidated city.
In the management, negotiation and contracting plan: (i) The urbanisation initiative
should bring together contracted synergies between the various socio-economic agents and
the administrative authority; (ii) The administrative authority assumes proactive leadership
through a firm urbanisation programme based on negotiation and contracting with the agents.
In monitoring the state of the territory and the governance performance level: (i)
Develop monitoring systems for the state of the territory and the degree of implementation
of the TMI, for permanent surveillance of the territorial and socio-economic dynamics; (ii)
The system of indicators should be structured along three axes + one: environmental, social,
economic and governance.

Proposals for an adaptive territorial management model

interdependences in which it is intended to think today about the reality of tomorrow and which
forms an ongoing and interactive process with an ensuing dynamic character. However, as was
made clear above, the act of designing a territorial model and programming the actions to build
it, does not in itself ensure it is consistent with the dynamics, uncertainties and surprises, and
also the territorial impact, which may occur in cities.
Several methodological approaches should be put in place. It is assumed that positivist
planning is outdated because, as Pardal et al. (2000) mention, planning is not knowledge or
foresight of a phenomenon but a component that forms part of the phenomenon. Some argue that
prospective planning is no longer valid today due to accelerated dynamics and paradigm changes
and one should adopt a planning by opportunity (Just-in-Time) towards tendencies. In contrast to
that approach, we use the push/Fordist approach regarding planning and management (Just-inCase) in which it is long-term planning that plays an active role in the process. While JIT is based
on a more horizontal hierarchy which consists of a strong initiative, cooperation and interaction
between the agents, teamwork and multifunctionality, JIC focuses on a rigid, vertical hierarchical
structure which requires the specialisation and functional segregation of the controlled agents,
provoking competition between them (Alfasi & Portugali, 2004).
As for the vision to be developed, the future is not written but is to be undertaken, as Godet
(1996) would say. Therefore, as it is not possible to predict the future, given the uncertainty
and exactitude of this, it is necessary to anticipate the dynamics of the tendencies (scenarios)
and describe what is desirable. What is therefore proposed is an exercise in foresight where the
future is not seen as extension of the past, since it is subject to contingencies and wills, but to
visualise multiple possible indeterminate futures given the level of freedom of human action. On
the other hand, planning or management of urban systems has to be carried out on different
spatial and temporal scales, and at different levels of activity (Fig. 6), both in the design of the
future desired and in the definition of the actual means to get there i.e. it provides a strategy, a
set of behavioural rules, to enable us to reach the policy objectives. Thus, the strategic planning
(development vision plan) establishes the objectives that compromise the long-term while
operational planning seeks to select and apply, in the short term, the means necessary to attain
these objectives (action plan).

Theoretical assumptions
Urban multifunctionality is based on a relationship of mutual cause and effect between
its topo-morphological structure and the nature of the services to be provided. Efficiency
and accuracy of management in territorial governance is essential for all of this. Demographic
concentration requires the planning and implementation of public policies to ensure quality of
life and environmental conservation, otherwise urban chaos and a deseconomy of resources
will occur. The sophistication of structure and territorial development led to the need to
carry out planning, through the act of designing and programming actions within time and
space with physical effects with functional and sustainable performance with a framework of

However, the strategic planning methodologies of cities have already gone “from the descriptive approach to action/decision” (Ferreira, 2005), in the interpretive and critical perspective and has gone from a rationalist vision to a collaborative approach (Pereira, 2009). If the
product results from a creation process, the qualities of that product are a reflection of the
good dynamics and the good options taken throughout this process i.e., information, method,
instruments, determination and accuracy in complying with the strategy that does not reject innovation and opportunities. This is a principle which also arises when dealing with the creation
of the urban space and which will have to result from a process regulated by coordinated and
attentive management of both internal as well as external factors. These factors are linked and
interact according to a dynamic hypercomplexity where mediation, assessment and regulation
instruments have been little or not at all utilised in the area of urbanism. That is to say, given that
new reality, there must be an interactive planning for this dynamic reality, with a self-adaptable
ability or self-reactive to the contextual dynamics at each moment, i.e., planning with strategic
management interacting with contextual and external dynamics.
On the other hand, the City, in a meeting its plans, is constituted as a territory or system which
develops supply and demand dynamics according to market logics. As such, the construction
and development of the spatial or physical structures of that system needs to be managed as
a complex undertaking, using pure business management techniques which have to be guided
by a vision of the overall market involving and assuring conditions of efficiency, resilience,
sustainability and competitivity. However, with the fundamental distinction, that while business
management involves material gain – financial as its fundamental objective, urban territorial
management has the fundamental aim of satisfying the interests of society.
In summary, a planning process constantly regulated, upstream, by a strategic reference
framework, guided towards development objectives and implementation targets resilient to
(social, economic and ecological) dynamics of the context and to externalities, through preventive
and structured monitoring.

Innovating mechanisms for systematically cohesive and adaptive management
This imposes the need to reform positivist planning, introducing urban TM instruments and
mechanisms with new instrumental ranges, which are economically and financially important,
and with properties to adapt to the trends verified at each moment and opportunity. In this
sense we can systematize certain proposals, structured as instruments, according to the
planning levels:
At the level of strategic planning - defining a vision and development objectives sustained
by a previous assessment of the state of the territory and the potential interaction of this with
tendencies from the external surroundings, which enable the consideration of development
scenarios, both desirable and undesirable, to set up the guide for objectives and goals through
which the operative interim planning is designed and conceived.

Innovation for Resilience

At the level of interim planning – linking of plans and management within an iterative and
dynamic process, having as a reference strategic planning but being weighted by preventive
assessment mechanisms for goals and externalities, which caution budgetary implementation,
seeking concerted solutions, involving all actors and stakeholders.
At the level of operational management – implementation of a panoply of operationalisation
mechanisms for auxiliary management for preventive assessment, for information for the
agents, bringing interests together and implementing urban projects, promoting quality and
environmental, social and economic sustainability.

Territorial management through prospective and integrated assessment
Integrated prospective
Planning consists of assessing the present and projecting a desired future but, as it is not
possible to predict the future, and given the uncertainty of the exactitude of this, one can and
should anticipate the dynamics of trends and describe what is desirable (setting scenarios). What
is therefore proposed is an exercise in foresight where the future is not seen as an extension
of the past, since it is subject to contingencies and wills, but which visualises multiple possible
indeterminate futures given the level of freedom of human action. An integrated planning is
adopted to attain this prospective, which conceives a desired future at the same time as defining
the actual means to get there, that is, it consists of: equipping ourselves, in the long term, with
a strategic vision, a set of objectives sectorally set out (development vision plan); At the same
time, interim planning is carried out which conceives of the rules of action and behaviour, in
the short to medium term, which will enable the obtaining of the policy objectives previously
defined but ensuring the maintenance of the necessary balances for the sustainability of the
systems (tactical plan); At a third level, operational planning is carried out which, in the short
term, seeks to select and apply the resources necessary to reach these objectives (action plan).
Currently, growing uncertainty brings new risks of failure for positivist strategic planning and
a future lack of preparedness to face externalities driven by undesirable events or tendencies.
Thus, (prospective) planning for the future but (preventively) weighted by ongoing assessment
is crucial to sectors such as urban infrastructure networks (transport, energy, etc.), the evolution
of which is strongly dependent on the short and medium term. Achieving urban sustainability
will largely depend on how we manage the complexity and uncertainty of the interactions
between natural systems and human systems. It is necessary to apply the exercise of Urban
Prospective, through constructing scenarios - foresight is a way of structured thinking which
makes it possible to project the future, control it, and (often) create it (Rogut and Piasecki, 2011),
but it is also necessary to apply the exercise of Future studies which is a new discipline seeking
to discover or invent, examine, assess and propose possible, probable and preferable futures
(Ratcliffe and Krawczyk, 2011), both cited by Bina et al. (2014).

35

Integrated assessment
Support for preventive foresight is therefore systematic assessment. Featuring a set of the essential functional attributes of the multifunctionality of the urban system and its respective variables, as referred to in point 3.5.1, the integrated assessment of performance is carried out from
the perspective of the effects on the recipients in terms of harmony and social cohesion and the
level of effort and fair sharing of economic burdens. If this is carried out in a segmented manner
it is shown to be inefficient because the simple assessment of the attributes is fragmented and
does not bring together the interdependencies and effects from the perspective of the sustainability of the dynamic equilibria of the system. This assessment is therefore cross-sectional, carried out according to three principles (“filters”): social equity seeking to ensure the objectives
of harmony and social coherence; economic sustainability seeking to ensure the objectives and
policies concerning supply and demand dynamics of the territorial base; ecological sustainability
seeking to ensure the imperatives concerning regulating critical interdependencies between the
elements of the system and between these and the recipients, as an urban ecosystem. And so
the interaction between prospective and assessment leads to regulation.
To reach an assertive assessment, a system of indicators oriented towards local strategic
assessment must be set up but which is also interoperable with systems of indicators at a higher
level, at a regional, national, European level, specifically the list of indicators proposed by ESPON
(2011) for the purposes of assessment regarding European policies for territorial cohesion. These
are based on five main axes: [1] intelligent growth in a competitive and polycentric Europe;
[2] Balanced development and equal access to services; [3] Conditions of local development
and geographical characteristics; [4] Environmental dimension and sustainable development;
[5] Governance, coordination of policies and territorial impacts. In addition, the systems of
indicators, besides converging with policy-guidelines in force, should add critical indicators for
future-implementation, i.e. those which signal (alert) that, from a given moment there is an
element with a trend which could potentially or probably create a risk of instability within the
system and identify the sectoral areas and the TMI where adaptation regulation measures are
to be taken (Fig. 7).

Complexity
The effective management of the territory and urbanism is the main factor ensuring quality
of the urban space. For that reason, the planning process has to be guided by targets, the
implementation of which is monitored based on a structural analysis. However, the management
of urban systems is an area of hypercomplexity in which the factors and interindependences
of the problems are exponential, thus requiring instruments that facilitate a coordinated
management of the territory and urban systems in an integrated manner. Besides being an
integrating element, the planning and territorial management process should be guided by
implementation goals and regular reassessment, given the dynamics which will have occurred
in the meantime, and the state of the situation and the actual previously established objectives.
Therefore, this requires integrated management endowed with prospective planning based on
Innovation for Resilience

systematic assessment which promotes adaptive spatial planning regarding the dynamics of
this multifunctional complexity, since, as already stated by Ferrão (2011), the emergence of new
social, economic and environmental dynamics requires innovative solutions regarding public
action coordinating actors and linking policies.
According to Bertalanffy (1975), the system or “organised complexity” may be defined as
being a set of elements experiencing “strong interactions” and the general theory of systems has
the aim of studying the elements which make up a system, as well as the interaction between
them. Indeed, the study of each one independently does not lead to an exact conclusion
regarding the system of which these elements form part. This definition encompasses a variety
of realities such as an environmental system (i.e. ecosystem, urban system) or an organizational
system (i.e. administration, management).
The complexity of territorial systems, due to the multiplicity of sectoral areas, the diversity of
actors’ strategies and numerous imponderable factors or externalities, requires the sophistication
of the means of governance and reinforcing planning processes and operative management.
This complexity and magnitude results in the need to think and act promptly at different levels,
from the more strategic to the more operational, and at different levels of action, from the
design or programming of actions until their execution, and also adding the need to register the
results of the monitoring and assessment actions. “The Theory of Complexity shows that even if
unpredictable, there is an order or intrinsic organization within apparently chaotic behaviour...”
(Lamb, 2006, p.16), quoted by Queirós (2009) which refers, also, to these notions having been
reviewed and tested, in planning processes in Portugal, the conclusions for which, furthermore,
complement the idea that to obtain efficacy in these processes it is necessary to integrate factors
coordinating synergy and leadership which lead to new states of maturity or balance, generating
consensuses and bringing together the actions of autonomous actors, making use of tools
such as collaborative platforms and information systems and territorial management support.
In accordance with the theories of strategic planning, this should be processed at three
fundamental levels, namely the strategic, the tactical and the operative; (i) The strategic
level, on a larger scale, has the purpose of defining the territorial model and the desired
development vision; (ii) The tactical level, at an intermediate level, has the aim of defining the
urban structure model translated into the various sectoral subsystems of the urban system; (iii)
Finally, the operative level has the purpose of designing solutions and defining the methods and
mechanisms for actual implementation and, I would emphasise, the registration of information
(quantitative and qualitative data) concerning both the implementation and the state of
conservation of the environment and the dynamic inter-relations between the elements of the
physical system and between those elements and the social system. It is therefore the case that
strategic management is processed at different levels but, however, there has to be a logic of
vertical connection between levels of planning, which, in our understanding, is divided into
three procedural levels of operation, i.e. planning and management: (i) That of the definition of
the vision and objectives, from the more general to the more specific; (ii) That of the definition
of models, methodologies and mechanisms dealing with action and material implementation,
from the management model to the strategic level to mechanisms and criteria for urban
implementation; (iii) Finally the assessment procedure, to diagnose the state of the situation
and recommend the revision and reformulation of the plan, management and action.

How to ensure the efficiency and effectiveness of the management of complex urban
systems
The TM system is hierarchical, organising itself through coordinated interaction at national,
regional and municipal levels. This institutional structure implies coordination between the
various territorial levels and the respective instruments, at the level of sectors and intervening
bodies. The organisation of the SM is pyramidal, applicable at the institutional and spatial scale,
with this also being the case with regard to the competences and functions of management,
from the strategic level (assessment of the context, balancing of the scenarios, vision options)
to the operative implementation (contracting and carrying out short-term implementation), to
the interim level (formal consideration of the physical systems, legal regulation, programming its
implementation, systematic monitoring). In addition, at each level of action mentioned, there are
different areas of operation, from establishing objectives (global strategic vision, local or sectoral
strategies, specific objectives) to pertinent actions for assessment procedures, to procedures
for defining methodologies and solutions for implementation (regulation, programming and
project) (Grave, 2013). The first aspect, essential for the TM system which we are carrying out,
concerns its functions, that is, that which it serves in general, as a whole, and that which it
serves in each of the nuclear elements. To respond to the stated theoretical foundations, and in
accordance with that described above, we will now define the Core Functions of the integrated
Innovation for Resilience

system for strategic territorial management (ISSTM), through the matrix of Core Functions of the
territorial management system (Fig. 8).

Carrying out the TM functions is undertaken by system elements, the status and form of
which are adapted to each management level and area: (i) the instruments (mechanisms and
processes); (ii) the agents (public, central and local administration, socio-economic agents, local
community and urban implementation promoters); (iii) important resources in the TM (human
resources, information, facilitating tools). Finally, to briefly describe the system, its inter-relations
should be mentioned, that is, the connections and dynamic interdependencies between the
nodes or functional cores of the system (Fig. 8): (i) core inter-relations at the level of operation;
(ii) core inter-relations at the area of operation; (iii) interdependencies regarding the external
surroundings. Through this structure we can construct the consultation and action guide
adapted to the environment of the TM for each actor and each strategic reference framework
to be observed in each context. Furthermore, with this structure shaped as such and utilising
an assessment methodology using balanced-scorecard indicators, mentioned in point 4.6,
performance assessment can be carried out both for efficacy, through verifying the state of
the territory, and the efficiency of the SIGTE, through verifying the application index of the
management instrumental framework and the level of implementation of the programmed goals.

How to ensure adaptive territorial management
According to Carvalho & Gonçalves (2014), since positivist planning does not include
uncertainty or risk, it provides a limited vision of the future in not considering speculative yet
possible scenarios, making it inappropriate and structurally incapable of considering the future.
Indeed, outlining the future territorial model is not enough, even if it provides the necessary
implementation and funding programming, because throughout the development process
39

externalities occur driven by events or tendencies stemming from the surroundings which in
some way influence the supply and demand market for urban products, whether these be real
estate or individual or collective services. There was therefore a need to ensure that the planning
includes consideration of uncertain but possible scenarios as well as establishing routines which
ensure predetermined ongoing assessment and regulation.
Which procedures and mechanisms should be adopted so that they form preventive assessment
and self-regulation factors (determining the revision) of the planning and management system?
To respond to these issues it is necessary to: (i) go beyond the positivist approach, that is, so
that adaptive TM reaches the goal of sustainable urban planning with the resilient city having to
attach future studies to the usual urban studies, i.e. speculate on possible scenarios so as to be
able to assess future impacts and determine the measures or precautions to be taken depending
on the desirability or undesirability of these; (ii) introduce automatic implementation mechanisms
for assessment-regulation procedures in a systematic manner rather than timely or facultative,
according to levels of scope and depth as well as differentiated temporal rhythms.
Thus, to ensure adaptive TM the following is proposed: (i) Undertake, as proposed by
Carvalho and Gonçalves (2014), the exercise of construction scenarios which outline narratives
forecasting what may happen, what we wish to happen, what should not happen and what
we do not want to happen, enabling us to anticipate or approximate dynamic paths or trend
trajectories which these may lead to. This will enable the better assessment both of measures
oriented towards the desired strategic objectives and maintain monitoring on what may
constitute a potential risk; (ii) Establish mechanisms within the integrated TM system which,
as a rule, implement two planning cycles - the strategic cycle: implementation > strategicassessment > review of strategic modelling > implementation of new policies > implementation
programming, according to a more extended time period (e.g. political mandates) – the tactical
cycle: implementation > systematic-assessment > tactical reprogramming of policies to be
implemented > readjustment of the programming or even the urban implementation (Fig. 9).

Innovation for Resilience

Assess the performance of the territorial management system
To respond to the functional multiplicity of the territory, the TM system has caused a proliferation in the sectoral policies falling under the remit of other administrative authorities. Alongside
this, the agents and forms of entrepreneurial partnership for urban development have multiplied.
In the meanwhile, the science of complex and self-organizational systems emerged which self
regulates and evolves through incremental changes. Outdated deterministic planning has now
been succeeded by open system management, capable of exchanging energy with its enviro­
nment, but organisationally closed to be able to find its internal coherence (Queirós, 2009). In a
complex system, the verification of results, if observed in a partial or segmented manner, does not
confirm either its systemic coherence or its related re-adaptation to the evolution of the context
and, therefore, neither with the principles of sustainability and resilience. With SM it is necessary
to reconcile interests and establish options depending on the pre-assessment of the context and
tendencies. For Queirós (2009), spatial planning is no longer limited to the institution and to the
technical team. In fact, concerns are accentuated with the coverage and effectiveness of sectoral
integration and its strategic dimension, involving numerous options and institutions which have
become systems made up of networks of actors, both internal (planning process managers) and
external (stakeholders…) who, together, direct the evolution of the planning processes. The design of spatial planning has become collaborative, shared, often turbulently (Healey, 1997), and
dynamic as the parts interact to configure the space of the networks. The integrated planning of
the territory therefore consists of a network where all points interconnect, with different intensities, adopting the complex behaviour resulting from the level of interdependence. Becoming
more familiar with the problem of the complexity of the processes of territorial management, it
becomes easier to find the path to achieve a better and more sustainable spatial management
(Queirós, 2009). However, once the sectoral policies and the strategic development vision have
been defined, this will have to be implemented and materialised. Policies focused on environmental or economic sustainability seeking harmonious development and social satisfaction will serve
for nothing if that vision does not indeed mark the state of the territory and the socio-economic
dynamics. Despite the efforts made in designing SM strategies, evidence of deficient planning
persists. This proves that strategic planning, in SM, has remained a closed system and territorial
management has not included the assessment of its own performance and the learning of new
options and practices based on a systematised balance between the defined objectives and the
results obtained. We have noted a failure of theory over the obvious need for integration between
strategic planning and operative implementation management within SM. According to theories
of integrated management applied to companies, strategic management should be assumed as
an integral approach capable of aligning two fundamental processes: operational efficiency and
competitive strategy. To this end, it is necessary to revise the current processes carried out by different agents within the system. In this context, the balanced-scorecard is a valuable tool, since it
enables the monitoring of organizational performance within a perspective of interdependence
with the strategy and promotes feedback for strategic planning (Kaplan, R. & Norton, D., 2010).
The TM is carried out by a wide set of agents/actors, with differentiated tasks and objectives according to the different management levels and areas, each one with their interests and individual
or sectoral strategies, and all this should be brought together, in an effective synergy, around a
41

single and coherent strategic vision (Fig. 10). Therefore, it is essential that all actors have a full
perception of the overall TM system, and harmonise their knowledge, information and trained
competences in the respective area of activity. In order to do that, it is necessary to have instruments facilitating management endowed with systemic assessment based on balanced indicators.

of the territory reflected in the results of the case study presented and then the statement of the
potential benefits which the proposed innovations may bring if they were applied.
The impact of rapid urbanization and abrupt stagnation on the state of the SM: The following
context was found: (i) The TM authorities, in classifying urban land and establi­shing its category
of use, were not aware of this creating potential value (gains) which stimulated dynamics in the
land market and in urban developments; (ii) Those dynamics took on an accele­rated rhythm to
the extent that the real estate supply market greatly exceeded demand; (iii) The municipal investment programme in infrastructure and collective amenities was oriented in terms of maximising
demographic expectations influenced by the rhythm of growth in the housing stock; (iv) The
investment initiative, the funding systems, the means of production and employment were attracted locally by the expectation of extremely high and rapid profits, with the general economy
becoming too concentrated and dependent on the building industry and the real estate markets
related to the new urbanisation; (v) The sudden indefinite and generalised stagnation of growth
led to a scenario in which an immense number of infrastructures were ready to enter into service
but without users/paying individuals, others unfinished and rapidly deteriora­ting, wasting energy
in useless street lighting, and mistakes in the allocation of collective amenities; persistent debt
and bad debt; proliferation of toxic financial assets, losses and bankruptcies in the means of production, high rate of unemployment; (vi) In the areas of accelerated urban growth, which lasted
around a decade and a half, a somewhat faceless environment was created, not to say that of an
actual abandoned works site, thus prejudicing urban living conditions.

For the aforementioned systematic assessment, a system of indicators must be developed to
measure the level of efficiency in each of the segments or functional cores of the SIGTEA, that
is, for each one of the levels of activity (strategic, interim and operational) and for each of the
areas of activity (prospective, regulation, assessment) and, therefore, delineate the profile of
efficiency-performance for each agent (e.g. municipalities). Finally, with the composite indicators
that define this profile it is possible to establish an integrated index that quantifies the level-ofperformance that each TM agent shows within the SM framework. For example, considering
the structural model of performance indicators (Fig. 10), it is possible to carry out performance
verification from the perspective of the efficiency of the processes and instruments, i.e. in drawing
up and applying the TMI inherent to the instrumental structure according to the proposed
SIGTEA model (Fig. 8), thus reflecting the profile of the instrumental efficiency-performance.

Conclusion
The conclusions are set out according to the question raised at the start of this article, that
is, how to achieve sustainable TM of the urban system, i.e., of the resilient urban development,
capable of preventing or adapting excessive urbanisation dynamics which result in persistent
situations of dysfunctionality and environmental deterioration; stagnation and urban diseconomy.
These are organised into two parts, concurrently point by point, first the summary of the state
Innovation for Resilience

Potential benefits of the innovations presented for a better and more resilient TM: (i) Carrying
out a strategic-preventive TM, with medium to long-term urban foresight, where excessive, i.e.
expansionist, optimism regarding growth and municipal development would be detected, and
the TM agents could have established a more considered delimitation of the urban perimeters;
(ii) Balanced-scorecard assessment cyclically analysing market dynamics, through urban
econometrics, which would have enabled the first signs of slowing down to have been detected,
and the (lack of) harmony between supply and demand and the taking of tactical regulative
measures concerning urban programming and implementation; (iii) Systematic monitoring and
assessment would have enabled the tactical regulation of the programming of the capacities of
general infrastructures and collective amenities; (iv) Through a balanced-scorecard based TM
system, investors and promoters and funding agencies would have been informed and could
have made more considered choices in new development initiatives and wider investments in
the real estate market; (v) Better preventive assessment of the size of urban perimeters and more
timely regulatory action concerning growth would have enabled expansion to have been curbed
and focus given to the existing urbanised space; (vi) Furthermore, during times of expansive
urbanisation dynamics, the TM authorities could have triggered the procedures to revise the
MMP, so as to reshape or reverse the course of events.
Final Note: The TM agents should integrate the subjects of economics and management in
their planning action and schools of Economics and Management should increase their training
activity in specific competences for Economics and Territorial and Urban Management.

Innovation for Resilience

Introduction
This chapter aims to relate the reorganization of public services networks and innovation in
their performance, questioning whether territories have become more resilient and cohesive or,
on the contrary, more vulnerable.
To respond to territorial disturbances caused by globalisation (uncertainty, co-evolution,
interdependence, rupture and marginality), new concepts have been adopted, particularly those
of resilience and territorial cohesion. The former refers to the capacity of territories to adapt
and resist to external shocks, without collapsing, and constructing sustainable and creative
solutions; the latter, based on the cohesion policy of the European Union (EU), seeks to profit
from territorial diversity, through concentration, cooperation and connection, so as to attenuate
development divergences at different levels within the EU.
Amongst the alterations, what stands out is the decrease in the weight of the State and intrinsic consequences in the reorganisation of public service networks. Thus, from the 1980s onwards,
in most European Union countries, and a little later in Portugal, there was both the restructuring of public service networks with face-to-face assistance (as seen in mergers, re-conversions
or even closures of units), and their growing use/provision of information and communication
technologies (ICT). These changes, started as a result of the adoption of neoliberal policies, the
assimilation of new public management models with growing ICT resource, and the diversifications of target-public needs and demographic alterations, were amplified by the economic
and financial crisis, obliging the State to adopt a more rational management of its resources.
The chapter is organised around three topics: it starts with a theoretical discussion on the
evolution of public services supply paradigms, linking this to concepts of territorial resilience and
cohesion; this is followed by a brief description of public services in Portugal, focused on those
related to education, health, justice (courts) and administrative matters (i.e., finance service, social
security and registries and public notaries); finally, based on a survey of resident populations
about the use of those services, three regional case studies are analysed, providing examples of
territories with different dynamics: densely urbanised metropolitan territory (six municipalities of
the Lisbon Metropolitan Area), a rural-urban axis (six municipalities within the Évora-Beja axis)
and a low-density rural area (the four border municipalities of the Baixo Alentejo).

Public services, territorial resilience and cohesion
Paradigm shift in the provision of public services
From mutation of agents to service provision challenges
In recent decades, public services in Europe have recorded marked changes resulting
both from ideological options underlying the dominant political paradigms (with progressive
deterioration of the Welfare State) and corresponding provision models (direct intervention of
the State, multiple partnerships and forms of contracting), as well as shifts in the demand profile
(namely ageing, reduction in family size and urban concentration).
Pinch (1989, cited in Alves, 2005a) identified nine key aspects in the restructuring of public
services: (i) proliferation of self-service; (ii) increase in labour productivity through new functional organisational forms and/or methods of management; (iii) investment in technologies
to increase production, causing more unemployment and the foreclosure of equipment; (iv)
subcontracting of services to specialised companies; (v) the fostering of quality due to improved
skills or training of employees; (vi) materialisation of service functions; (vii) relocation of establishments to areas where land prices are cheaper; (viii) the provision of service functions in
households; and (ix) centralisation of services into larger units, reducing or closing smaller units.
For the authors, the pressures to increase effectiveness and efficiency and to concentrate services in larger spaces (such as governmental one-stop-shops) have similar criteria for both the
public and the private sectors. For Marques (2009:25) it is necessary to “import into the public
administration what the competition imposes daily in private organisations: customer orientation, promotion of quality, user satisfaction, economy costs, increasing productivity, developing
partnerships and modernising policies, which should be a continuous process and not just a
moment with a beginning and end.”
The demand for public services has grown in the last decades as a result of their universalisation (particularly health, education and social security systems) as well as public administration
interventions when acting as regulator (Alves, 2005b). New demographic and family structures
play a crucial role in the changing demand for public services, with there being more citizens
covered by access to public services and, in addition, the ageing of the population and the reduction of the number of elements per family require appropriate responses.
Socio-economic changes have been far-reaching and include: (i) the integration of Portugal
within the European Community (1986), which was very important for the economic growth
and the development of the country and this influenced the number, geographical distribution
and use of public services; (ii) the entry of women into the labour market, including jobs in public
administration and simultaneously creating new needs regarding the demand for services; (iii)
the increase in household income; and (iv) the improvement of the educational levels of citizens.
The combination of these factors have made citizens more demanding and consumers are
willing to travel a greater distance to obtain services with better quality standards, even at a
higher economic cost (Tomé, 2011). However, recent changes in the labour market have led to
an increase in the number of unemployed, and this requires the provision of more social benefits
(particularly social security and the exemption or reduction of fees for health care services).
Innovation for Resilience

The dynamics of public services have also been conditioned by improvements in accessibility.
Portugal built and improved its road system, partly with European funds, and now has 2860 km of
motorways, (while in 1986 it had less than 200 km) along with an increasing rate of motorisation
(245 cars per 1000 inhabitants in 1991 and 452 cars per 1000 inhabitants in 2014 - authors’
calculations with data from INE, the National Statistical Institute of Portugal). This progress in
accessibility, mobility and purchasing power contributed to the increase in journeys using private
cars and the reduction of mobility by public transport and walking (INE, 2003; Tomé, 2011), as
well as changes in the urban system, in particular: (i) the rise of the first residences in suburban
spaces, contributing to the expansion of metropolitan areas; (ii) the increasing segmentation of
social spaces; (iii) the creation of new user needs that led to new services for the population;
(iv) the emergence of new urban centralities, spaces and service facilities for the population;
and (iv) the integration of the territories and the services provided in cooperation networks at
different scales (e.g., regional and municipal). These socio-territorial changes have led to regional
imbalances in the distribution of services, with excess or unsuitability for the elderly population
in the inner city, and a deficit in the peripheries.
Benington and Hartley (2001, quoted in Hartley, 2005) suggest three different models to
manage public services (Table 1).

Table 1 shows that the relationship between public administration and social agents (individual or collective) is increasing, contributing to the co-architecture, co-production and
co‑evaluation of public services. According to Marques (2009:136), this is “the emergence of a
new paradigm of public service, in which the dependence of the citizen is replaced by a relationship of interdependence, with contributions from citizens, families and social organizations. It
thus facilitates opportunities for this co-production.” Needless to say, this differs with the type
of service, the entity that manages it and the geographical scale (national, regional and local).

The evolution of physical and on-line formats: features and implementation strategies
Recent developments in public services have been marked by concentration, integration and
specialization. The public services of education, health and justice are traditionally offered in their
own facilities, with their hierarchy/specialization following the urban system hierarchy. However,
priority has been given to aggregating them into larger units along with integrated management
for various existing facilities in the same territory. The use of electronic resources is still limited,
since the provision of these services requires territorial presence and direct interpersonal relations.
Public services of an administrative nature (e.g., finances, registries and public notaries or social
security), although continuing to be offered in specialised government departments scattered
throughout the territory, almost always in the head offices of municipalities, are now being offered
in other formats, both physical and electronic. Of note among the former are the single-window
services, the main objectives of which are to minimize the time and costs of providing these services and help the citizen by offering information and services from various public entities within
the same space, almost always with extended schedules and at accessible locations (Table 2).

point of view, information centres, single-window service centres and specialized service centres
can contribute to the reduction of trips and, in low-density areas, can also minimize the impact
of the closure of some of these public services.
Regarding the provision of public services on the Internet, the process is incremental, as
shown by the Gartner Group (Baum and Maio, 2000). In the first stage of the model (Presence)
only institutional information is provided (e.g., mission, contact details, opening hours and
official documents) and this content is usually out of date and is therefore not very interesting or
useful for citizens. In the next stage (Interaction) more information is available, enabling citizens
to carry out searches, download or fill out forms, directly contact services or employees and
access other related sites on the Internet. In the third stage (Transaction), it is possible to provide
a full service through the Internet (i.e., service formulation, payment and delivery). Finally,
in the fourth stage (Transformation), there is a link between citizens and the various public
administration agencies. In addition to the high level of updating, robustness, security, reliability
and the existence of teams specialised in these areas, the public services policy provided on the
Internet is framed within a medium to long term strategy. There are normally common and
integrated networks and platforms involving various public administration agencies, such as
single-window desks, which enable citizens to only have access to a single contact point with
the public sector, independently of the service or body providing this.
The great availability (and robustness) of the public services on the Internet has impacted
on the (re)organisation of their physical networks, to a large extent due to cost differences;
using Denmark as an example, Tinholt (2013) shows that internet service provision costs may
be less than 1/3 of face-to-face services. This reduction reflects the transference to the user of
functions previously performed by employees. With the generalisation of this model the State
reduces costs, but this contributes to job losses, with an economistic attitude overriding a social
logic. The benefit to the citizen is mainly linked to convenience and to the disappearance of
being subject to a working schedule, but does not avoid penalisation (for some) due to info
exclusion. Thus, with the growing spread of the Internet and the increased ability of citizens
to use ICT, public administration has tended to reduce its territorial presence and adopt new
forms of services provision, enhancing the added values brought by technological innovations.
It is therefore necessary to find a compromise between the incorporation of technology and
the spatial distribution of establishments bringing together all users – whether young or urban,
more qualified and willing to access Internet-based services, or a more elderly public, who prefer
face-to-face support – and not remove social functions, and the animation and movement
caused by public services, from the territory.

Public services, spatial justice and territory
Accessibility and “territorial proximities”

For Bent, Kernaghan and Marson (1999), Coutinho (2000) and Marques (2009), these three
models contribute to a provision of services which is simpler, more affordable, convenient and
personalized. However, in these formats the service offering is very much targeted to the services
of each entity most sought after and, therefore, the most standardised ones. From a territorial
Innovation for Resilience

Public services are essential in the organisation of the territory, affecting the daily lives of
their population and attracting new residents and businesses. They play a central role in the
urban system matrix and in interdependency relations. The reorganisation of their networks
49

(along with changes in road access) enhances adjustments in the urban hierarchy and in the
interrelationships between places, both in densely urbanised and low density territories. In the
latter, reinforcing the relative proximity between places, the rarefaction of the population and
social policies focused on cost reduction have tended to favour the concentration of services
in the larger urban centres, which are better equipped and more accessible, thus accentuating
inequalities regarding access, particularly in more outlying territories.
Distance and territorial proximity are therefore fundamental concepts when the provision
of public services to the population is in question, given its universal tendency. Proximity is
much more than the geographical distance between two or more points and may be analysed
in different ways: (i) physical proximity, i.e., the (geographical and temporal) distances which
citizens/users have to travel until they reach the establishment offering the service; (ii) temporal
proximity, i.e., the period of time between the emergence of a need and the actual provision
of such a service; (iii) social proximity, i.e., the existence of services to the population and the
conditions under which inhabitants, independent of their social origin, may utilise them; (iv)
cultural proximity, i.e., the greater the distance between places of residence and the provision
of service, the less identification there may be, particularly regarding rural populations; and
(v) symbolic proximity, i.e., the existence of a service in a geographical area may indicate the
presence of the State alongside the population, in the light of the subsidiarity principle (CORUM
(ed.), 2001). These five types of proximities cut across the territory, testifying to their importance
in differentiating the supply of and demand for services.
In this way, services which are closer or more distant may form social inclusion or social
exclusion vectors. Recent research has focused on the appropriation of the use of public services
by citizens, creating/reinforcing local identities and contributing towards improving governance
practices and the design of services. However, as Chauvière warns (2001:124), “proximity is a
guiding principle which, above all, shows political will.” Indeed, neoliberal public policies that
favour economistic logics tend to favour concentration, penalising supply based on proximity;
on the contrary, policies critical to this way of thinking seek a greater equilibrium between the
meeting of economic objectives and the coverage of social needs. The confrontation between
these perspectives has been evident in policies in recent decades in Portugal, with governments
sometimes defending models of greater proximity in health, education, justice and security and
at other times focusing on more concentrated models, in accordance with guidelines from the
troika (2011-2014).
Amongst the challenges which research into “proximity” faces is the degree of flexibility of
the concept and its relationship with the geographical scope of its application. Traditionally, such
research has studied consolidated urban centres and, to a lesser extent, rural areas. However,
these are scarcer in relation to suburban spaces, which has resulted from an accelerated and
unplanned urban expansion which, therefore, has its own specificities (e.g., at the level of the
availability and quality of the space intended for services to the population). The residential
emptying of city centres has also created specific problems related to access to services by their
residents, often with reduced mobility and economic constraints. In this sense, it is important
to reflect on the proximity/accessibility of services in the outlying areas to the major urban
centres and in their central areas, as well as applying research concepts and techniques in case
studies at a larger scale to the neighbourhood. In low density rural areas, where the population
Innovation for Resilience

is ever more rarefied and aged, accessibility to public services requires another type of approach
(for example the itinerant supply of services) since the improvement in accessibility provided
by new road infrastructures is often more apparent than real; in fact, in many cases the new
highways link regions within a “long-distance” logic, but have difficulty in “serving” those who
live there, who become dependent on the local road network, which is often run-down and
which imposes more lengthy travel times than those listed in the technical reports.

Social and spatial justice in the distribution of public services
The neoliberal vision of the administrative and social organization of the State favours a “mercantile” logic difficult to reconcile with the social satisfaction of citizens’ basic needs, which have
to be guaranteed by the State. Underlying that perspective is the privatization of public services
with market potential, which can be facilitated by restrictive operating policies compromising its
quality (Hespanha, Ferreira, and Pacheco, 2013). The State may not have an underlying purely
accounting view, since “the Welfare State should be seen not as a mere expense (or fat), but
rather as an investment which, in addition to ensuring a set of rights and basic levels of provision,
represents an indispensable means for the economic and human development of society in the
long term. The Welfare State is not fat, it’s muscle!” (Barata and Carmo, 2014:20-21).
Within this framework, the concepts of social and spatial justice owe a lot to the contribution
of Harvey (1973). For this author, social and territorial justice in the distribution of services to
the population implies: (i) spatial efficiency, as translated into minimising the distance to travel
between the offer and the demand for a certain service; (ii) social justice, related to equity
regarding access to supply, which is beyond the geographical conditions; and (iii) territorial
justice, close to “optimal spatial distribution”. In turn, Rivas (2012:77) summarises them in two
key points: (i) “income distribution should be such that: a) all the needs of the population
within each territory are covered; b) resources are made available in order to minimize
regional multiplier effects (reinforcing positive externalities); and c) additional resources are
invested to help overcome the difficulties caused by the physical and social environment”; and
(ii) “(institutional, organisational, political and economic) mechanisms must be such that the
disadvantaged areas should be helped as much as possible.” In this reasoning there is a logic
of positive discrimination, without which it does not seem possible to speak of (social) justice.
Therefore, the principles of spatial and territorial justice must underpin the management models
of services to the population - especially the focus on efficiency - and therefore their design and
distribution require integrated sectoral and territorial policies and strategies.

Territorial-based policies
Multi-scalar approaches
A fair spatial distribution of public services requires a systemic and relational approach,
characterised by the ability to integrate policies to various scales, considering aspects such as
51

institutional models and governance, the specific aspects of the territory, the population and
the productive system, and the level of openness to innovation, among others. New dynamics
arise with the (re)combination of these factors, which will impact on the design of public policies.
Public services policies and territorial policies should be ever more open to the participation of
social actors. As Marques (2004:423-6) mentions, it is “essential to think of constructing spaces
of governability based on variable institutions, supported by mutual trust, tacit understandings
and the effects of collective learning. This involves the fostering of cooperation subordinated to
a spatial governance strategy.”
The inclusion of these practices is not easy, nor immediately applicable, but it is necessary to
introduce them in public management, whether the services for the population or the territories.
This may take the form of processes involving the exchange of information and learning between
agents, in a greater sharing of and accountability for decisions taken, within the stimulus of a
new institutional culture, oriented by dialogue and consultation, and in obtaining economies of
scale, in which cooperation networks are established and resources enhanced. Given this, public
policies and governance models should be substantiated through flexible planning processes
based on territorial cooperation. In this regard, Ferrão (2000) and Marques (2004) recommend
three levels of strategic positioning for Portugal: (i) municipal; (ii) inter-municipal; and (iii)
regional. Accor­ding to Marques (2004:425), “these scales for a strategic approach (…) form a
type of different geostrategic layers.” Thus, at the municipal scale, there should be networks of
services and essential facilities for maintaining populations which, given temporal and spatial
specific aspects, can provide a balanced and integrated experience, with governance involving
varying geometries. However, the local scale is ambiguous, and administratively this may
take place at the level of the parish and the municipality, both with extremely heterogeneous
dimensions. In metropolitan areas, there are parishes with more than 50,000 inhabitants and
in low-density areas, municipalities with less than 2,000 inhabitants and parishes with less than
100 inhabitants. Given that the municipality is the reference point for the sizing and location
of public services, those discrepancies are not always suitably provided for. The inter-municipal
level has gained importance because “the lack of scale and functional diversity suggests
cooperation between cities and between territories, through which benefits from economies
of scale can be achieved” (Pereira, 2009:87). The regional scale seeks to integrate all the
features of the territory, exploiting its complementarities, in a multipolar urban system, where
different spaces for residence, work, consumption and leisure coexist, as well as a variety of
population profiles. Hence there is a need to ensure compliance with policy goals at the national
level, but adapting the programming criteria to specific territorial features and dynamics. The
OECD (2011:2) recognises these particular aspects in stating that “rural and urban areas face
different challenges. (…) Urban areas should not be seen as separate entities. (…) Urban-rural
partnerships, under certain conditions, may act as a source of regional competitiveness, through
the creation of externalities resulting from mechanisms of complementarities and synergies
generated.” Services to the population might play an important role, since they satisfy social
needs, contributing to their quality of life and the greater attractiveness of territories.

Innovation for Resilience

Public policies, territorial resilience and cohesion
The presence of the State, through social and administrative public services, is decisive for
development and territorial cohesion. In the more peripheral and/or outlying territories this
ensures social conditions of permanence for the residents; in the more dynamic territories,
this supports the population and the business community, contributing to reinforcing its
competitiveness. The European Commission (2004:4-5) states that “services of general interest
continue to be essential for social and territorial cohesion and for the competitiveness of the
European economy”. Citizens and companies rightly expect to have access to quality services
of general interest at accessible prices throughout the European Union.”. The same document
argues that “the supply of quality services of general interest (…) contributes to attaining the
strategic objective of the Union, which consists of making the economic space more dynamic
and competitive in a knowledge-based world, able to ensure sustainable economic growth,
with more and better jobs, and more social cohesion” (European Commission 2004:5). The
Green Paper on European Territorial Cohesion (European Commission, 2008) launched
the discussion on the concept, applicable to different scales and a multidimensional nature,
considering territorial quality, efficiency and identity. Given the importance of public services
for territorial cohesion, it is imperative to emphasise the importance given by that document to
the fair and balanced access to facilities, to the infrastructures and to knowledge; to the need to
develop forms of cooperation, improve governance and foster public-private partnerships; and
to readjusting the administrative network, without compromising institutional cohesion.
However, the territorial cohesion policy of the European Union has not had the success
expected, not only due to the urgent integration of countries with distinct social and economic
realities (2004), but also because of the onset of the economic and financial crisis (2008). Known
the diversity and divergences which characterise the present-day Europe, territorial cohesion
policy, limited to rhetorical discourse, has gained relevance and practical justification. Given
the vulnerability of many of the territories due to the crisis and the added level of political and
economic unpredictability, it can be argued that public policies take principles inherent to this
concept as a reference. As Marques (2009:18-19) emphasises, “changing from a management
of predictabilities to a management of probabilities, in a global world where no government
controls every factor (…) requires public and private organisations to be more adaptive and
resilient.”. The social reform of the State, in its administrative part and its public services, cannot
therefore be carried out as a result of the application of general formulas without meeting
the specific characteristics of the territory, and the concrete needs of the population residing
there, as this would lead to the acceleration of regressive trajectories. Indeed, a modern and
dynamic system of public services, capable of adjusting itself on an ongoing case-by-case basis
to the needs of the population and transformations in the business fabric, contributes to making
territories more resilient, albeit with varying responses. The typology proposed by Martin (2012)
for regional economic systems can be adapted to the different territorial scopes within this
proposal. According to this writer, after a recession, the responsiveness of an economic system
can take five paths: (i) the impacts on the regional economy are so severe that they prevent the
resumption of the pace of previous growth (Figure 1A); (ii) the system can recover its growth
rate, but only partially (Figure 1B); (iii) in the medium and long term, the system returns to
53

its performance prior to the disturbance (Figure 1C); (iv) after an initial phase of turbulence,
changes in the system result in increasing the growth rate in the medium term, but this will tend
to decrease in the long term (Figure 1D); and (v) the economic system recovers from the shock,
adapting to the new circumstances, resulting in a constant rate of growth in the medium and
long term, which exceeds the expected economic performance before the recession (Figure 1E).

Furthermore, according to Martin (2012), the construction of the strategy based on
resilience implies attending to the resistance, recovery, reorientation and renovation capacities
of a regional system. Now, in this transformation public services are decisive because: i) they
compete to ensure living conditions for the populations and the functioning of companies; ii)
when modernised, they are drivers of that process.
The next section summarises the recent development of public services policies in Portugal
and, later on, taking as reference three distinct territorial realities, some effects of its application
are discussed in terms of territorial resilience and cohesion.

Public services in Portugal
Public services as a pillar of the Welfare State
Following the democratisation of the country, the Constitution of the Portuguese Republic
(CRP, 1976) determined that the State is to provide a set of public services for the population,
to ensure fundamental rights such as education, health and justice, along with a network of
administrative services.
Regarding education, by the time of joining the EEC, the system was democratised at all
levels. Compulsory schooling was fixed at nine years by the Framework Law of the Education
System (Law No. 46/86, of 4 October) and higher education expanded and diversified, and so
Polytechnic Institutes and Universities were also set up away from the urban littoral areas. Since
then, compulsory schooling was extended to pre-school education (Law No. 5/97, of 10 February)
and also extended to the 12th year (Law No. 85/09, of 27 August). This evolution has imposed
Innovation for Resilience

permanent modifications on the networks, in terms of their expansion or contraction, in trying
to respond to the dynamics of demand (at the various levels of schooling) and policy guidelines
at the planning level and the types of schools. Despite the variety of situations, the dominant
trend has been one of concentration and vertical and horizontal integration of existing schools
in specific geographical territories, which is inherent to the concept of “educational territory”.
The area of Health witnessed the consecration of the National Health Service (Serviço
Nacional de Saúde - SNS) (Law No. 56/79, of 15 September), in which the State safeguarded
the right to health protection through institutions and services providing comprehensive care to
the population, financed through taxes, having set up a network of facilities providing services,
from primary to more specialised care, of different typologies. The 1990s saw new reforms, in
particular the Framework Law for Health (Law No. 48/90, of 24 August) and the new Law for
the National Health Service (Decree-Law No. 11/93, of 15 January). This reform enhanced the
private sector and envisaged the private management of health units. In 1999, the concept of
Local Health Systems (Sistemas Locais de Saúde - SLS) was created (Decree-Law No. 156/99, of
10 May). It established functional links between health centres, hospitals and other services. In
2001, the Hospital Referrals Networks (Rede de Referenciação Hospitalar - RRH) was created,
seeking to regulate complementarity relations and technical support between all hospital units
and, in turn, between the hospitals and the health centres. The 2004-2010 National Health
Plan altered the guidelines of previous policies, advocating corporatisation and public-private
partnerships in the sector. To summarise, the SNS consecrated the universality of the system, the
State’s responsibility as a healthcare provider and the importance of primary health care. The
implementation of the network of facilities necessary to meet those objectives was supported
through structural funds. Despite the investment made, problems in accessing SNS resources
have remained (e.g. millions of citizens still do not have a General Practitioner and the number
of people on surgical waiting lists remains high). The difficulties of the public health system
being able to respond to the growing demand pressure (exploited by private groups which have
chosen health as a business area) has led to the introduction of the concept of a “tending to be
free” service changing to a “tending to be paid” service and the strengthening of contracting.
However, private investment has focused mainly on densely urbanised areas, thus contributing
to accentuating the marginalisation of low-density territories.
In the area of justice only the territorial matrix of the judicial system was addressed,
particularly that of the courts. Between the mid-1970s and the end of the last century, the key
elements of the judicial system were the circuit courts (39 in 1977; 58 in 2000). In 1988, 43
círculos judiciários were established, and there were 79 in the year they were dissolved (Law
No. 3/99, of 13 January). Districts and district courts changed, respectively, from 216 and 175
in 1977 to 233 and 130 in 2000. This was therefore a judicial organisational model based on
geographical proximity. In the 1990s modifications to constituencies and the aggregation of
districts occurred, along with the establishing of new courts and further specialisation. However,
in the first decade of this century, the need was felt for a legal matrix more adapted to social
and technological changes, the new types of crime and the emergence of extremely large cases,
which led to the 2008 reform (Law No. 52/08, of 28 August).
In addition to education, health and justice services, this analysis also includes a set of services
of an administrative nature which have undergone organisational and technological changes
55

which have changed their relationship with the user. Of note, amongst these, are tax offices,
social security services and registration services (civil, land, commercial and vehicle registries)
and notary offices. These services have a territorial matrix based on main district centres, and
there has been a gradual expansion and dissemination of these networks in densely urbanised
areas. Their modernisation has taken place in three ways: major technological investment
seeking to digitalise services (above all tax services, due to the need for the State to maximise its
tax collection); the introduction of multi-service and electronic formats; privatisation of notary
offices (Law No. 49/2003, of 22 August 2003; Decree-Law No. 26/2004, of 4 February, altered
by Law No. 51/2004, of 29 October) and the subsequent reduction in public notary offices.
So, in the first twenty years, the country experienced rapid economic changes (increase in
purchasing power, the making of the tertiary sector of the economy), social changes (reinforcing
the middle class, feminisation of the labour market) and demographic changes (falling birth rate,
increasing life expectancy, ageing, decrease in family size, marked urbanisation and littoralisation),
which required ongoing flexibility of policies and facilities and support infrastructures. At the
same time, there was growth of private investment and services traditionally provided by the
State, in particular education and health, focusing on urban areas where the population with
greatest purchasing power was concentrated. These dynamics, caused by a combination of
multiple factors, often with contradictory effects, brought about mismatches between supply
and demand, forcing, at the turn of the century, both the reorganisation of public networks,
seeking greater rationality and efficiency, and the adoption of types of contracting between
public and private sectors.
With the economic and financial crisis (2008), this reorganisation underwent major
changes, in its rhythm (suspension/postponement of ongoing and/or projected investment),
in terms of process (closure, concentration and privatisation) and in its actors (decentralization
of competences to local authorities, strengthening of private companies and foreign capital).
The request for financial assistance and the arrival of the troika required a reduction in public
expense, with this causing major repercussions in the implementation of facilities and the
human resources linked to the provision of these services.
As such, the subsequent analysis is based on the most recent changes, carried out by the
17th Portuguese Constitutional Government (2005-2009), but undermined by the outbreak of
the crisis, which eventually led to the fall of the following Government (2009-2011). The 19th
Government (2011-2015), strongly limited by the impositions of the troika, based its actions on
reducing public expense through: i) the drastic reduction of public investment and management
expenses; ii) the favouring of privatisation.
Figure 2 summarises the main changes carried out in public services in Portugal, considering
changes in (socio-economic, demographic, technological and organisational) values; the
evolution of formats, their territorial presence and the adaptation to the needs and expectations
of users; the impacts in the level of services and of territories.

Effects of the crisis on the reorganization of public services networks
Education
During the 17th (2005-2009) and 18th (2009-2011) Portuguese Constitutional Governments,
major reforms were started in the school network, particularly (i) the extension of preschool
educational supply, making it compulsory and increasing the number of establishments, through
the creation and direct management of local public administration and the formalisation of
agreements with social economy entities; (ii) the reorganisation of available schools, closing
primary schools with less than 21 students; and (iii) the creation of the Modernisation Programme
for Existing Secondary Education Schools.
In 2011, the signing of the troika’s Memorandum of Understanding did not impose major
changes in this area. Capucha, Duarte and Estevão (2013:291) assert that the document “is scarce
in its references to education”. However, the document still stated that a reduction in expenses of
around 195 million euros was expected, along with the creation of new school clusters.
The main measures presented therein mainly envisaged aspects related to the quality of
education, drop-out from school, entering the labour market and a greater investment in
vocational education, with an increase in the number of state schools offering this.
The government in office between 2011 and 2015 carried out certain policies of its
predecessor, particularly the rationalisation of the supply of schools in territories with a low
number of students, but suspended the Modernisation Programme for Existing Secondary
Education Schools. The Guide for State Reform (Government of Portugal, 2014) proposed to:
(i) endow municipalities with greater competences, through contractual delegation, in new
educational cycles and the management of existing state schools in their district; (ii) grant
57

greater autonomy to schools, to specify their educational mission in line with national guidelines
(through contracts providing autonomy); (iii) formalise contracts of association with private
entities, in territories where state offer is reduced and educational failure greater; (iv) provide
families greater freedom of choice in selecting the educational establishment of their wards, by
granting them education-cheques (experimental project); (v) focusing on vocational education,
through increasing the total number of secondary school students attending such courses by
around 50%; (vi) rationalise the training offer in higher education and create a cycle of education,
with a duration of 2 academic years, to train senior professional technicians.
Table 3 shows recent evolution of supply and demand in educational establishments in
Portugal in three academic years, 2008/09 corresponding to the intermediate year of the
triggering of the crisis. In the first period the trend is for growth of supply and demand, with
the exception of the 1st and 2nd cycles, where the demographic effect and rationalization of
networks (closure and/or grouping of schools) are very evident. More recently, the reduction in
the number of establishments and the number of students is only slightly contradicted in the
provision for the 2nd cycle and the secondary population. With regard to the weight of public
education of note is, on the one hand, the reduction in supply at all levels and on the other hand,
the strengthening of demand, particularly since the crisis began.

Health
In the 17th and 18th Portuguese Constitutional Governments, one of the central pillars of
health policy involved the reform of primary health care, making it more accessible to citizens
and increasing demand for it as the first option, rather than hospitals. One of the aspects of
this policy was the reconversion of health centres into Family Health Units (Unidades de Saúde
Familiar - USF), provided with new services (such as oral health and specialised appointments)
and linked to other services within the health network. In practice, these units provided for
reinforcing GP (general practitioner) coverage which, according to Crisóstomo (2013), had
incorporated 570,000 new users since 2006. There were no hospital restructuring policies with
significant territorial impacts, but the National Network for Integrated Long-term Care (Rede
Nacional de Cuidados Continuados Integrados - RNCCI) was set up (Decree-Law No. 101/2006,
of 6 June). With the 18th Government already feeling the effects of the crisis, concern with the
economic and financial sustainability of the SNS assumed a greater importance.
The recommendations of the troika in 2011 were in the same direction. With regard to
service networks, references were only made to primary care and hospital centres. In the former,
the document recommended an increase in the USF and the guaranteeing of a greater number
of doctors in disadvantaged areas, to reduce territorial disparities in the access to and use
of health services and the allocation of more general practitioners. With regard to hospitals,
the troika argued for their reorganisation and rationalisation, based on the concentration and
specialisation of services, in a joint hospital management model. It should also be mentioned
that some of the services of the hospitals were able to be transferred to the USFs. In the opinion
of Crisóstomo (2013), the troika’s proposals, shaped by financial imperatives, could have
prejudiced the universal and equitable nature of the service.
According to the Guide for State Reform, the current SNS model no longer responds to the
needs of the population, who have very different living and hygiene conditions from those at
the time of its setting up. However, the document mentions that “the issue of insufficient overall
financing for the health system cannot be avoided, along with the scarcity of professionals,
demographic pressure and inadequate clinical and geographical management of units in need of
modernisation. The sustainability of the SNS is not an objective in itself, but it is a means so that
Portugal can continue to offer a universal access system” (Government of Portugal, 2014:889). The measures proposed in the health sector include the following: promoting efficiency to
ensure medium and long-term sustainability; reinforcing proximity between citizens and public
primary health services, to reduce social and territorial inequalities; increasing the network of
long term care services; encouraging the involvement of private entities and the social sector in
providing public health services (Government of Portugal, 2014).
Table 4 shows the evolution of some indicators for the health system, taking 2008 as the
reference year. Generally, there has been an increase in human resources per 1000 inhabitants
and a strengthening and stabilisation of health facilities, with the exception of health centre
extensions, which have suffered a notable fall. This can be explained by a reduction in population
in rural areas by efforts to concentrate uses into health centres, which are better equipped
offering more services.

proximidade (literally proximity chambers), 9 of which operate under special regimes. There was
a focus on specialisation, with the specialised sections increasing from 233 to 390. The central
chambers, with jurisdiction in their district, are divided into civil chambers (handling and judging
lawsuits worth more than €50,000.00) and criminal chambers (preparation and trial of cases
provided for in law within the jurisdiction of a collective court (involving more than one judge
or jury) and chambers with specialised jurisdiction (e.g., criminal investigation, enforcement,
labour, trade and family and minors). Local courts of first instance have the mission to handle
and try legal actions not attributed to the central court of first instance and these include
generic jurisdiction chambers, which may concern civil, criminal, petty crimes and “proximity”
chambers, as well as extended territorial jurisdiction courts.
The justices of the peace courts, extrajudicial courts with jurisdiction to resolve common civil
lawsuits up to €15,000 (excluding family, inheritance and labour law) were created in 2001 (Law
No. 78/2001, of 13 July). In January 2016 there were 24 justice of the peace courts in mainland
Portugal, 14 municipal and 10 groupings of municipalities.
Table 5 highlights the increase in the number of courts between 2001 and 2008, which underwent a slight reduction with the reform of 2008 and a marked change with the reform of 2013.
Table 5 – Evolution of the number of courts, by type

Justice
Public services relating to justice underwent successive alterations in the organisation
and operation of courts as initiated by Law No. 52/2008, of 28 August. In 2011, the legal
system consisted of three geographical levels (Law No. 46/2011, of 24 June and its respective
regulation): 4 Legal jurisdictions, with headquarters in Lisbon, Porto, Coimbra and Évora; 59
círculos judiciais (2 in the Autonomous Regions of Madeira and the Azores); 217 district courts
(7 in the Autonomous Regions of Madeira and the Azores). This diploma called attention to the
need for deeper reforms, an idea that was reinforced in the troika’s Memorandum. Following
this, at present, the judiciary is governed by the Law of the Judiciary Organization (Law No.
62/2013, of 26 August) and the Regime Applicable to the Organization and Functioning of
the Judicial Courts (Decree-Law No. 49/2014, of 27 March). These changes have the following
aims: (i) extend the territorial basis of the judicial districts, making them more connected to the
regional urban centres and population movements; (ii) establish specialised courts at a national
level, not just concentrated in the metropolitan areas of Lisbon and Porto; (iii) implement a new
model for the management of district courts. Regarding the second point, there already was
considerable provision for the Family and Minors and Labour specialities in the national territory
before the reform of the judicial map, and so the current reform only brought about greater
spatial coverage for the Penal and Civil specialities.
From the territorial point of view and regarding their proximity to citizens, most of the
courts remained but the justice system became organised around 23 district courts (one for
each former district capital, with the exception of Lisbon and Porto, with three and two district
courts, respectively. Fourteen districts had specialised resources at all levels). Therefore, out
of the previously existing courts, 20 were closed (they handled less than 20 cases a year), 264
were converted into 218 central chambers and 290 local chambers) and 27 became secções de

Office services
Public administrative services have a varying typology, and services relating to Finances,
Social Security and Registries and Notaries (Instituto dos Registos e do Notariado - IRN) will be
analysed here. Between 2005 and 2011 these services registered some changes leading to a
significant impact on the territorial reorganisation of their networks, and they were modernized
making use of information and communication technologies (ICT). The crisis and subsequent
need to rationalise resources accelerated the structural change of these services.
As regards the Tax Authority (AT) services, given the growing provision of public services on
the Internet, the troika’s memorandum proposed to rationalise its personal assistance network.
61

This measure sought: (i) to bring the finance services network in line with international standards
and practices; (ii) to save financial resources through reducing costs on infrastructures and
current expenditures; (iii) to reallocate human resources to activities generating greater added
value. The 19th Government, as part of the Aproximar (Coming Closer) programme, carried
out an assessment of its reorganisation, based on a composite indicator of productivity and
homogenised production, which included variables related to assets, expenditures, earnings, tax
justice and collection. Following this, although the possibility of closing tax offices was admitted,
this did not actually take place. As such, almost all municipalities have at least one finances
service and it is expected that this spatial distribution will remain, even in low-density areas.
As regards the physical provision of services relating to the Ministry of Solidarity, Employment
and Social Security (Ministério da Solidariedade, Emprego e Segurança Social - MSESS), it has
been rationalising its network through the setting up of joint services with the entities it governs
[Social Security Institute (Instituto da Segurança Social - ISS); Institute of Financial Management
of the Social Security Service (Instituto de Gestão Financeira da Segurança Social - IGFSS)
and the Institute for Employment and Vocational Training (Instituto do Emprego e Formação
Profissional - IEFP)]. This process, currently underway, was started with (i) the 2014 integration
of ten IGFSS sections, in the district ISS head offices; (ii) the sharing of service spaces between
the ISS and the IEFP; (iii) the use of municipal council spaces; (iv) the services offered by the
‘Lojas do Cidadão’ (administration and services single points of contact). The setting up of a joint
service network - which has required informatics systems interoperability between the various
institutions – has enabled citizens to deal with services related to the ministry in charge of these
in only one location. In the Guide for State Reform (Government of Portugal, 2014), the concerns
are related only to the economic and financial sustainability of the institution.
One of the main changes which has taken place in the services currently forming part of the
Institute for Registries and Notaries was the aforementioned privatisation of notarial activity. The
public notary offices that remain function as autonomous services, or in an annexation regime
with civil, land, commercial and auto-mobile registries. There are also nine Notary Offices with
Specialised Competences, almost all of them located in former district capitals in the north and
centre of the country.
Another important shift was the reorganisation of the registry networks initiated in 2011,
focused on rationalising installation and operating costs, in optimising human resources and
maximising use of the premises of the Ministry of Justice (MJ). This process is linked to a new form
of services provision, in which services related to registries are concentrated in the same physical
space rather than a fragmented operational logic. This integration has been facilitated by the
incorporation of ICT, particularly front offices. At the end of 2013, there were 84 civil registries
annexed to commercial and land registries, 46 land and commercial registries incorporated
in civil registries, and 46 land/commercial registries integrated within civil registries. First and
second land registry offices have also been joined together in Cascais, Sintra, Maia, Oeiras
and Coimbra. These measures were implemented through support from protocols with the
Agency for Administrative Modernisation (AMA), the AT (tax offices), the Institute for Financial
Management and Justice Equipment (IGFEJ) and several town halls. The main aim of these
partnerships is to provide facilities for the rehousing of registry services. This process continued
in 2014, with the merger of civil, commercial and land registries in Lisbon and Porto and the
Innovation for Resilience

coming together of registries in second-generation ‘Lojas do Cidadão’ in various parts of the
country, which in certain cases also made specialised services available, such as Desks for Citizen
Cards and for Portuguese e-Passports. In general, the main offices of each district have a civil
registry, a land registry and a commercial registry with jurisdiction in the district council area.
There can be more than one registry of the same type in the main office or parish offices with
more than 30,000 residents, when the service volume in the same district so justifies. However,
the more recent tendency is to annex different types of registries within the same district.
The ‘Loja do Cidadão’ in Lisbon opened in 1999, providing a format which made a diversified
set of public and private services available during extended opening hours. In its initial stage the
concept was limited to the metropolitan areas of Lisbon and Porto, but in 2009, under the Simplex Programme (Presidency of the Council of Ministers, 2006), the “second-generation” model
started operating and a year later there were 19 units (Tomé, 2013c). This expansion occurred in
the district capitals in country areas and in small and medium-sized cities and coincided with an
OECD recommendation (2008:17), according to which “(...) ‘Lojas do Cidadão’ form an important
framework model of user-centred ‘one stop shops’ [complemented by] a global strategy to provide multichannel services, with the provision of additional options for service delivery channels
combined with transactional advanced administrative e-services.” Their territorial spreading was
justified by the need to provide “a greater integration of services based on life events [and] geographically and financially rationalize the public services distribution model, without losing their
proximity to citizens along with savings on installation costs.” (RCM No. 87/2008, of 27 May).
The Guide for State Reform (Government of Portugal, 2014) kept the policies in place for
the Lojas do Cidadão, particularly in terms of digitisation becoming the norm, as well as a focus
on the provision of on-line public services en masse, assisted on-line help (taking advantage of
partnerships between central public administration, town halls and civil society). The Strategy
for the Reorganisation of Public Administration Desk Services (Estratégia para a Reorganização
dos Serviços de Atendimento da Administração Pública - ERSAAP) provides more information
on two policies currently taking place which are directly related to the Lojas do Cidadão: a new
management model for the Lojas do Cidadão and the creation of a complementary entity, the
Espaço do Cidadão (literally the “Citizen Space”). The new management model for the Lojas
do Cidadão’ is based on their management being contracted out to the municipality, rather
than undertaken by central administration. There are already some Lojas do Cidadão operating
in this way (e.g. those in Rio Maior and Santarém) and the pace of openings is expected to
increase. At the end of 2015 there were 37 Lojas do Cidadão in operation. In the meanwhile,
and in addition to this format, the Espaço do Cidadão is an idea based on a “single window”
concept, digitally assisted, located in post offices, town halls and parish councils. It aims to
ensure a minimal lower cost presence of the State throughout the national territory. Although
it has a “minimum” format, it can help bring public services to citizens, and fight info-exclusion
and promote social and territorial cohesion. According to ERSAAP, “This network will take
advantage of the massive investment the State has made in the reorganization and digital
provision of public services, reducing the current gap between the broad supply of these
services and the low demand for them by citizens” (RCM No. 55-A/2014, of 15 September:
4964-58). The development of the Citizen Space Network is taking place in conjunction with
local government and the private entities, fostering a shared management model adjusted to
63

the needs of each territory. The aforementioned document adds that “the territories of lower
population density, where the supply of traditional public services is lower, will be the most
privileged areas. By creating 1000 Citizen Spaces between 2014 and 2015, this complementary
network to the LC network, will provide the country with a considerable network of public
services points of delivery close to citizens.” However, at the end of 2015, according to figures
released on the AMA website, there were still only 347 units operating in the country, providing
around 170 different public entity services.

Regional case studies
Methodology
The demarcation of the regional case studies was based on the territorial dynamic modelling
in mainland Portugal (2011), carried out by Tomé (2013a, 2013b and 2015). Thirty-six indicators
and variables were considered, grouped into six themes: population; buildings and housing;
economic system, territorial attractiveness and competitiveness; employment and living conditions; urban centralities; transport, accessibility and mobility. The analysis of this geographical
information resulted in a typology in urban, rural and transition areas, with the former having
most of the public services (education, health, justice and administrative) analysed (Table 6).

Starting from that typology, three regional case studies (CS) were selected, involving sixteen
municipalities:
•	 CS1: this corresponds to metropolitan/densely urbanised territories; it includes Lisbon and
five municipalities of the Setúbal peninsula (Almada, Palmela, Seixal, Sesimbra and Setúbal);
•	 CS2: urban-rural axis; it includes six municipalities of Alentejo (Beja, Cuba, Vidigueira,
Viana do Alentejo, Portel and Évora);
Innovation for Resilience

•	 CS3: rural areas; it includes the four border municipalities of the Baixo Alentejo (Barrancos,
Moura, Serpa and Mértola).
In the CS1, Lisbon, the capital of the country, has a structuring role in the national urban
system, polarizing it demographically and economically, and concentrating facilities and services,
especially those at a higher hierarchical level. On the south side of the Tagus river, Almada and
Setúbal are the municipalities with the largest populations, specialized facilities and services,
with the former benefiting from greater proximity to Lisbon and the latter from the importance
of its port and industrial activity. The central area of the Setúbal Peninsula includes urban areas
of low/medium density (Fernão Ferro/Quinta do Conde/Azeitão), some of illegal origin, shared
by the municipalities of Seixal, Palmela, Setúbal and Sesimbra. Its function as a “dormitory” area
has been reinforced with recent improvements in road and railway networks.
In CS2, the cities of Évora and Beja dominate the organization of the regional urban system,
with the former ever closer to Lisbon and subject to its influence. Improvement in accessibility
between Évora and Beja seems to have made this city more vulnerable, with the loss of some
services to the other. The remaining municipalities are more rural in character, but enjoy
proximity to those two urban centres and the axis that connects them.
CS3 is a border area with Spain, which has had negative social and demographic dynamics
for decades. The public services available within it are scarce and not very specialised.
To understand the way people use the various public services in those territories, an on-line
survey was carried out between March and May 2015. This was intended to: (i) describe the
use of different public services in the last two years; (ii) become aware of the location of the
establishments used, the associated travel times (main residence - establishment), the service
formats (if applicable) and the reasons for their choice (if applicable); (iii) identify the services
and activities where there is compleme ntarity between the public and private sectors; (iv)
determine the degree of satisfaction with the different public services; (v) assess expectations
regarding the need to use the services in the following three years.
In order to define the sample, the starting point was established as carrying out 810 surveys,
which corresponded to a +3.44% margin of error for a 95% confidence interval. The questionnaire, previously tested, was sent by email and through social networks (Facebook and LinkedIn)
and also distributed by professors of the New University of Lisbon and the Polytechnic Institute of
Beja, which disseminated it in the study areas. The 16 municipalities making up the 3 case studies
were classified into 5 categories, in accord with their population levels, and a minimum number
of surveys per municipality was established in accordance with their category: A (Lisbon) – 250
surveys; B (Almada, Seixal and Setúbal) – 60 surveys; C (Palmela, Sesimbra, Évora, Beja) – 50 surveys; D (Moura, Serpa) – 30 surveys and E (Portel, Viana do Alentejo, Cuba, Vidigueira, Mértola
and Barrancos) – 20 surveys. According to these criteria, the envisaged 810 surveys were divided
as follows: 530 in the CS1, 180 in the CS2 and 100 in CS3. The number of responses obtained
was much higher, enabling a more rigorous selection process for its validation, with it being possible to consider variables such as the age structure and the rural/urban nature of the parish of
residence, in order to minimize any resulting bias for the preferred distribution of e-surveys. Out
of all the surveys received, 173 were eliminated, and 951 validated: 627 in the CS1, 224 in the CS2
and 100 in the CS3. The maximum error margin is thus +3.17% for a 95% confidence interval.

Use of Public Services
The use of public services is similar in the three case studies: health services are most in
demand by the populations, followed by public services related to administration, education
and, lastly, justice (Table 8).

Innovation for Resilience

However, there are differences in each service based on its nature, frequency of use and
complementarity of the public offer with the private sector.
In education, in the three case studies, most students attend basic education (1st, 2nd and
3rd education cycles - years 1 to 9) or higher education. The complementarity with the private
services is highest in the CS1 (32.2%) and lowest in the CS3 (10.9%), which is associated with
smaller private offer in the rural territories and the lower financial resources of households. The
private sector involvement in educational services are mainly free time activities, school support
and sports activities.
In health, proximity services are used by the largest number of respondents, although with a
reduced frequency (2 to 3 times a year). Regional services are also in demand, by around 80% of
the respondents, while specialised health services are the least used (22.9% to 34.4%). However,
in both cases, use is rare (once a year). The largest usage rates occur in rural territories. In the
public services analysed, the greatest complementarity with the private offer is in the area of
health – metropolitan/densely urbanised territories (75.9%), urban-rural axis (63.2%) and rural
territories (53.1%) – mainly for medical specialisation appointments. The choice of the private
sector to obtain health care is, to a large extent, related to the existence of agreements with
health subsystems, the speed in making appointments and subsequent care, the quality of the
service and the quality/price ratio.
The justice services are hardly used by the respondents: 16.0% in the CS3; 21.9% in CS1; and
23.2% in the CS2. Among the courts most used, the most sought-after specialisations are civil,
administrative, criminal, family and minors and labour. The scarce use of justices of the peace is
connected with their smaller territorial presence outside the large urban centres, but also a lack
of knowledge of this service by the population groups.
69

As regards administrative services, finance is the most sought-after and registry and notary
services the least requested. Frequency of use varies between services, but there are clear
differences between the three types of territories. In general, finance services are used 2 to 3
times a year, while social security, and registry and notary services are rarely used (once a year).
In the service formats most sought-after there are different territorial trends: on-line portals and
Lojas do Cidadão are accessed most in metropolitan/densely urbanised territories; specialised
departments are used more in transition territories, which also show modest use of Lojas do
Cidadão and Espaços do Cidadão; specialised departments also dominate rural territories, but
there the Lojas do Cidadão and the Espaços do Cidadão have had relative success. Contrary to
what happens in the other public services analysed, in the CS3 there is greater use of specialized/
intermediary private agencies (9.6%).

The most mentioned location for justice services in all territorial contexts is the municipality
of residence but in another parish. Among the public services analysed, those of justice - and,
in particular, the courts - are those where there is a greater use in other municipalities than
those of residence or for study/work, justified, to a large extent, by the territorial deployment
of the courts and by specific legislation, which establishes the access criteria based on place
of residence. In terms of time, it is in the Évora-Beja axis that the courts are more accessible
(between 6 to 15 minutes). In the metropolitan/densely urbanised territories, distance-times of
16 to 30 minutes are dominant in the access to courts and to the justices of the peace and over
60 minutes in the rural territories.

Expectations of use in three years
Location and distance-time to the service
In education public services, it was seen in the three case studies that for preschool and
primary education, most respondents use ones in their municipality and parish of residence.
However, in general the ratio of the “in the municipality” and the “in the parish of residence”
answer and the other options tends to decrease in proportion to the level of education.
As regards higher education, the differences between the analysed territories are obvious,
related to the availability of supply: in CS1 most respondents use institutions located in the
municipality of residence but in another parish; in the other case studies the most representative
answer is in another municipality (other than the municipality of residence and work). The
distance-time between the usual place of residence and the teaching establishment varies, in
most levels of education and in the different case studies, from less than 5 minutes to between
6 and 15 minutes. Only in higher education is the distance-time greater to these values in the
CS1 (between 16 and 30 minutes) and in the CS3 (more than 60 minutes).
In health, proximity services are located mainly in the municipality and the parish of
residence, regional services are in the municipality of residence but in another parish and
specialized services in another district, unlike the municipality of residence and study/work.
Health services are generally little used in the municipalities where individuals work or study.
These locations are reflected in the distance-time from the place of residence to the closest
health facility: for proximity services these are almost always between 6 and 15 minutes,
although the number of responses “less than 5 minutes” is similar; in the metropolitan/densely
urbanised territories, the regional services are between 16 to 30 minutes, in the urban-rural
axis they are between 6 to 15 minutes and in the rural areas between 31 and 60 minutes; and
for the specialised services these are between 31 and 60 minutes of the population (CS1) and
over 60 minutes (CS2 and CS3).
Respondents showed that administrative public services, regardless of their type, have
similar territorial patterns: in the CS1 and CS2, the three services analysed are available in
the municipality of residence but in another parish (only social security in the CS2 is more
represented in the municipality and in the parish of residence); and in CS3, all services are
obtained by most users in the municipality and parish of residence.
Innovation for Resilience

By 2018, most respondents admitted they will use education services: 56.0% in urban areas,
69.6% in the urban-rural axis and 59.0% in rural areas. As for health, almost all (99%) expect
to make use of public services. In both services, the public sector will continue to stand out in
the provision to their respective populations, above all in the CS2, which is justified by the lack
of private offer and lower purchasing power of its residents. Regarding the way in which the
services should be provided, the respondents show preference for face-to-face service, possibly
supplemented by telephone or on-line assistance for education and health.
As regards administrative public services, the overwhelming majority of the respondents
expect to use services exclusively in the public sector, through on-line portals but, if necessary,
resorting to face-to-face service for specific issues.
In the public justice services, due to this being difficult to predict, most respondents do not
know whether they will use them or not, but, if they do, this will be face-to-face.

Reorganisation of public service networks from the individual and territorial perspectives
The respondents were also questioned about the impact of the reorganisation of networks
in both individual and municipal terms. In all case studies, the majority showed difficulty in
carrying out this assessment, mainly in the metropolitan territories. In these, the polycentric
structure and high accessibility and mobility make it more difficult to understand geographical
patterns and the difference between public and private offers. In the urban-rural axis and in rural
areas, this perception is clearer, given the greater knowledge of the territory of residence and
lower possibilities of choice due to lack (or absence) of supply. Those who express an opinion on
this matter differentiate impacts from individual and territorial perspectives: in urban territories
what is most emphasised is the harm to the individual, in contrast to rural areas, where the
stronger sense of territorial identity gives rise to greater concern for the community.
To sum up, the results confirm that in urban territories the greater number and diversity of
services reinforce the proximity effect and broaden the choices of users. On the contrary, in
other areas, and more sharply in rural areas, the shortage of supply and the greater distances
to travel to access services penalises their use. This condition is aggravated by the profile of the
71

residents, who tend to be more elderly and dependent on public transport, which is scarce. Thus,
it is vital to find alternative forms of access to services in these areas, particularly concerning
flexibility of opening and operational criteria (schools, health centres), and the provision of
electronically supported fixed and/or itinerant multi-service formats (e.g. in the parish council).

Reflection from the perspective of territorial resilience and cohesion
Over the past 40 years, the network of public services in Portugal has undergone marked
changes. With a democratic regime, a Welfare State was set up, supported by essential
redistributive policies to bring the country out of its structural backwardness in development
and reduce territorial inequalities.
Following the initial political instability, the decade that preceded Portugal joining the
European Economic Community (EEC) saw the launching of policies with a strong social impact
(education, health, social security, justice), which started to alleviate the widespread underresourcing, but also contributed to aggravating national public accounts.
After joining the EEC (1986), the availability of structural funds through successive Community
Support Frameworks provided infrastructure and facilities to the country, with ever greater
and more diverse networks. This generalised coverage of territories, guided by the principles
of equality and universality of access to services, thus contributed to reinforcing territorial
cohesion. However, at the same time this led to a lack of investment in traditional sectors such
as agriculture, fishing and industry, contributing to the weakening of the productive base of
the country, making it more dependent on the outside. Strong public investment generated
societal changes, with repercussions in the territories, reinforcing littoralization, dispersal in
the occupation of densely urbanised areas, the emptying of city centres, and the widening of
low-density territories. The different rhythms in the design/application of policies and territorial
dynamics (induced, or not, by these) generated imbalances, and even contradictory effects,
between the responses which were implemented (and which became prematurely obsolete)
and the emergence of new needs (the response to which has not been immediate).
However, a sequencing and combination of exogenous and endogenous events has
contributed to a significant change from the previous framework, sharpening the existing
contradictions. As regards the external aspect, the demand resulting from Portugal being
included in the Eurozone (2001), the consequences of the enlargement of the EU to the east
(2004) and the effects in Europe, particularly in southern countries, of the American financial
crisis (2008) affected the capacity for public and private (external and internal) investment in
the country. As regards the internal component, the first signs of crisis showed the difficulty
of bearing the costs of operating and maintaining infrastructures for and networks of facilities
(without EU support). At the same time, the crisis accentuated imbalances in that model of
creating infrastructure with regard to socio-demographic developments, already previously
perceptible but neglected. These, by themselves, justified reorganisations of the networks,
seeking to introduce greater rationality in their operation, which could be seen in some cases,
without taking into consideration specific local aspects (e.g. closure of primary schools with a
number of students less than a pre-established limit, which has been increasing). In fulfilling the
Innovation for Resilience

troika’s Memorandum, focused on public expenditure reduction and its deficit, the neoliberal
Government went against the dominant thinking in Europe marked by public disinvestment in
services of general interest, paving the way to the extinction, contracting, subjection to a free
competition framework and the privatisation of public services.
The principle of equity, which requires the availability of infrastructure and public facilities as
well as universal access to services of general interest, was passed over for criteria of (presumed)
efficiency. The spatial and functional concentration of these services has resulted in difficulties
in adjusting to demand needs and preferences. In low-density areas spatial equity in access to
public services, when considering the distance to the points of delivery and of choice, has been
penalised, especially taking into account the spread of the population, the accentuated ageing
of the population and their decreased mobility. The territories are more vulnerable and territorial
cohesion has been compromised.
To summarise, there was a period of euphoria, with an excess of voluntarism for public policies,
stimulated by Structural Funds, which also led to perverse effects, which have perhaps been
underestimated (especially the over-sizing of equipment and inadequate spatial distribution),
which reached a critical period, marked by the difficulty of public authorities in supporting
the operational and maintenance costs of the previous model. The crisis has aggravated these
negative effects, which have penalised territories, thus making them more vulnerable.

Cooperation or Firm-Based Innovation? Evidence from the
Portuguese Economy

Introduction
In today’s knowledge-intensive economies, the enterprises can have a strong economic and
social influence. Facing today’s economic instability they ought to provide a constant stream of
innovations to clients. Then, they often need external expert knowledge in order to cope with
current trends and achieve business success. Firms are able to create a steady demand for their
products/services if they constantly readjust their strategies. Researchers suggest that firms can
reshape the market through their innovations, for which can contribute some external sources.
Economic success is determined by enterprises’ ability to offer solutions to changing needs,
trends and structures. More enterprises acknowledge that change is not only important, but
also compulsory due to the fact that they constantly face a fast changing market. Innovation
can be achieved in a variety of elements such as products, services, operations and processes
depending on the enterprise’s resources, capabilities, requirements and strategies.
The process of developing an innovation may imply three types of approach: make; buy or
cooperate with other agents to acquire specific competences or knowledge. The last occurs
when the firms’ internal knowledge or skill-base is not sufficient or effective and is conveniently
complemented with external sources. Several studies on innovation support that firm’s boundaries
require porosity in order to absorb knowledge and capabilities from the external environment.
This can provide an extensive variety of ideas, opportunities, sharing of costs and resources.
Clients constantly demand new services, according to their exposure to external information
and trends (even through the internet - social networks, virtual worlds, etc.). Therefore firms
need to correspond to their expectations and satisfy their needs. A work about this issue, based
on a sample of 70 firms in Algarve (Belo et al., 2016), shows that firms are already using social
networks for customer knowledge acquisition and not only for advertising purpose.
Firms’ cooperation, among them or with clients or other stakeholders, and its potential
for innovation is not new. The literature confirms that firms that do not co-operate, and do
not formally or informally exchange knowledge, limit their long-term knowledge-base and,
ultimately, reduce their ability to enter into exchange relationships (Hanna & Walsh, 2008;
Pittaway et al., 2004). More specifically, regarding product and process innovation, positive
77

associations were found in cooperation with customers, suppliers, the public sector and
universities (Freel & Harrison, 2006).
In this work our aim is to identify the sectors of the Portuguese economy that most engage
in cooperation to develop innovation and which sources and/or agents are most used, by
sector and type of innovation (with incidence in product and process innovation). To attain
these goals, it is structured as follows: next section makes a literature review on the assets
and agents of cooperation for innovation; third section describes the research framework
(instrument, sampling and frequencies) for appraising the nature of the innovation process in
terms of cooperation or firm-based innovation by type of innovation (product/process); then
fourth section differentiates these results by sector outlining which cooperation sources/agents
are most used (scope) and relative intensity (scale); finally fifth section concludes and refers
future directions of research.

Literature review
Today it is more difficult for enterprises to maintain a competitive advantage only through
internal R&D (research and development), due to technology or market discontinuities caused by
knowledge-base and business changes. Given the dynamism and complexity of this environment,
enterprises need to complement their internal resources and capabilities with ideas from outside,
interacting with a wide range of actors. This contribution to internal R&D can give enterprises access to complementary assets, needed to turn an idea into a successful product or service. Thus,
many firms seek external partners and knowledge in order to compete in this dynamic and fast
changing context. Regarding these issues, it is interesting to analyze if Portuguese firms complement their internal R&D with external sources, and which ones according to their sector of activity.

Innovation and its assets
Innovation and its external vs. internal assets are the main subject of this research, i.e.
cooperation vs. firm-based innovation and sectorial patterns. Innovation is a theme of interest
for researchers in different business and management disciplines such as strategy, information
technology, marketing, entrepreneurship or even engineering and product design. A definition
of innovation common to all of these areas is not easy. As Damanpour and Schneider (2006) state
that innovation is studied in many disciplines and has been defined from different perspectives.
For instance, Baregheh et al. (2009) collected 60 definitions of innovation from the various
disciplinary literatures in their study. Addressing this ambiguity, these authors proposed a
definition for summarizing the meaning of innovation: “Innovation is the multi-stage process
whereby organizations transform ideas into new/ improved products, services or processes
in order to advance, compete and differentiate themselves successfully in their marketplace”
(Baregheh et al., 2009: 1334).
It is important to mention that it can only be considered an innovation when the enterprise
develops an invention that is introduced in the market and is commercialized bringing economic
Innovation for Resilience

return to the firm (Kuznets, 1962). Innovation can be achieved in a variety of elements depending
on the enterprise’s resources, capabilities, requirements and strategies. The most common types
of innovation refer to products, materials, services or organizational structures (Ettlie & Reza,
1992). The dataset used in this work is provided by the Community Innovation Survey (CIS) 201012, which collects information on four major types: product/service, process, organizational,
and marketing innovation. In this research, we focused on the first two main types: product/
service and process innovations.
Other authors have already focused on different sources and types of innovation: Pavitt
et al.(1987), Lundvall (1988), Cornish (1997). For instance, Propris (2002) concentrated her
investigation on the impact of inter-firm co-operation over innovation on four different
dimensions of innovation: product, process, incremental and radical innovation.

Theoretical background of innovation
Since the 1980s, firms should reassess their innovation strategies due to the increasing
volatility of the competitive environment with shorter product and technological life cycles
(Nijssen et al., 2001). New products and services had to be faster developed (Chatterji, 1996).
Organizations strive to gain competitive advantage and consequently they adopt innovations to
enhance their organizational performance (Hernandez et al., 2008). Already in 1925, Marshall
recognized that the firms’ internal knowledge base should be conveniently complemented
with external sources. Since the mid-1990s, in order to exploit new opportunities, achieve
economies of scale or market strength, multinational firms as well as small and mediumsized firms have been establishing more relationships with other companies (Rosenfeld, 1996;
Hagedoorn et al., 2000). Today, given the dynamism and complexity of modern society it is
essential to complement the enterprises’ internal knowledge with external expertise. Even major
organizations, attentive in terms of innovation, cannot depend exclusively on internal sourcing,
requiring knowledge beyond their boundaries (Rigby & Zook, 2002). Freeman (1991) stated
that firms with R&D departments have a propensity to employ external knowledge sources
intensively. Several theorists point out that the introduction of new products and processes into
the market rely on the firm’s skills to build strong relations with external agents meaning that
firms seldom innovate on their own.
It is now widely acknowledged that firms’ innovation patterns depend on the sources
employed and that they are specific to each industry (Archibugi et al., 1991; Evangelista, 1996).
External sources are of extreme significance to small and medium-sized firms particularly those
belonging to knowledge-intensive sectors (Smith, 1993; Malecki & Tootle, 1996; Rothwell, 1992;
Shapira et al., 1995).

Open innovation
In the process of developing new products/services it becomes essential to perceive the
significance wielded by external agents as a source for successful innovation projects. In present
79

economies firms cannot rely solely on their own R&D; they need to balance internal sources
and capabilities with ideas from outside and interact with a large number of players (Lundvall,
2010; Szulanski, 1996; Laursen & Salter, 2006). This is the main strength of the open innovation
model (Chesbrough, 2003a, b). Open innovation is defined as: “…the use of purposive inflows
and outflows of knowledge to accelerate internal innovation and expand the market for external
use of innovation, respectively” (Chesbrough et al., 2006: 2).
In the open innovation model, the firm’s business model is tailored in privilege of R&D
activities, and the technological change takes place outside the firm. As a consequence,
innovation becomes progressively more spread among the various partners. Then new ideas
and knowledge for product innovations can result from collaboration with external partners
(Lambe & Spekman, 1997). On the one hand, external knowledge connections are a vital factor
in the open innovation model, and on the other a complement to internal research (Cohen and
Levinthal, 1990; Veugelers, 1997; Chesbrough et al., 2006). Following this approach, firms that
are internally centered need to open their boundaries to external partners, otherwise numerous
opportunities may be missed (Chesbrough, 2003a; Laursen & Salter, 2006). Several studies
support that firm’s boundary requires porosity in order to absorb knowledge and capabilities from
the external environment (Chesbrough, 2003b; Shan et al., 1994; Leonard-barton, 1995; Powell
et al., 1996). This can provide an extensive variety of novel ideas and innovation opportunities
(Laursen & Salter, 2006; Powell et al., 1996) and access to complementary resources to turn an
innovation into a market success. The use of external knowledge is a vital element of innovative
performance (Cohen & Levinthal, 1990).

factors support the firm’s decision to cooperate: e.g., share expenses and uncertainty, exploit
synergies, recognize economies of scale/scope, as well as benefit from government support
(Veugelers & Cassiman, 1999; Becker & Dietz, 2004). Given these advantages from cooperation,
if innovation has been introduced in an industry, no cooperation will be acknowledged as a
competitive disadvantage (Enkel et al., 2009). The innovation process may involve external
sources from different origins, ranging from clients, suppliers, universities to competitors,
among other agents (Von Hippel, 2005; Powell et al., 1996).
Essentially, innovation sources are divided in two types: internal and external. Table 1 shows
these sources in detail. The internal type relates to the innovation activities carried out within
the enterprise: R&D, marketing and production departments. The external type is related to: (1)
market sources such as customers and users, suppliers, competitors, consultants and experts,
among other sources; (2) educational and research sources; and (3) public available information.

Cooperation for innovation
In most countries, the economic environment where business takes place is defined by
complexity and dynamism. Fast changing factors such as technology, customers or competitors
force enterprises to renew their strategy in order to survive, reshaping their activities, in
particular innovation development. The process of developing an innovation normally implies
two types of strategy: generate knowledge in-house (make) or purchase it (buy) (Veugelers
& Cassiman, 1999). Nevertheless, in recent times theorists have detected a third strategy for
acquiring knowledge - cooperation with other agents (Navarro, 2002).
Strategy specialists have demonstrated that agents from outside the enterprise constitute
a significant resource in modern competitive context, especially in the development of new
products and processes (Peteraf, 1993). The enterprise’s intention to cooperate with other
agents in innovation activities is impelled by the fact that it is an efficient way to improve the
chances of success of differential products or services (Becker & Dietz, 2004; Abramovsky et
al., 2005, Sampson, 2007). Besides, enterprises that are highly internally focused, not opening
themselves to external networks and relationships, may miss a lot of interesting combinations
(Chesbrough, 2003a; Laursen & Salter, 2006). Thus, in innovation the decision to cooperate with
other agents is important since it will enhance the enterprise’s learning capabilities.
However, literature states that enterprises’ performance depends on their ability to locate,
absorb and exploit those sources in a productive way (Cohen & Levinthal, 1990). Several other
Innovation for Resilience

It is clear that enterprises have at their disposal a wide range of agents to cooperate in
their innovation effort. But decide on which one(s) to cooperate with depends on the ability
to identify the type of agent that can better satisfy their internal needs and improve their
competitive advantage.

81

Customers

Competitors

Customers can be the cooperation agent with greatest impact on the intensity of innovation
activities, somewhat because it is a vertical or non-competitive cooperation. Their involvement
in the manufacturing and service sectors is a good example of their contribution in new product
development (Sánchez-González & Herrera, 2014). The success of product innovations in public
sector institutions is also highly related to cooperation with customers (Freel & Harrison, 2006).
This external partner is an important source of knowledge because its inputs help firms to
identify new ideas about products and solutions, understand customers’ attitudes, and identify
new market trends in advance. For example, high-tech industries benefit from customers
contribution particularly to learn about technological trends and develop superior products
(Brettel & Cleven, 2011). Some firms invite customers to participate in the innovation process,
most frequently in the design of the next new product (e.g., the online Lego DesignbyMe tool).
Regarding complex technologies and/or products, this external source provides particularly
valuable information (Von Hippel, 2005; Tether, 2002). The similar principle applies when the
product presents a high level of novelty (Amara & Landry, 2005). This can be explained by the
fact that the user’s experience can be of great help, either to reshape or improve the existing
design or give ideas for new models and applications. Apart from improving the product design,
collaboration with customers provide a more controlled development of the innovation process
taking less time and lower costs (Jeppesen, 2002).

Establishing a relationship with competitors is normally referred as horizontal cooperation.
Competitors are an external source that can be involved in the innovation process (Von Hippel,
2005). The knowledge generated by these agents can easily be accessed and exploited by firms
that do not hold a high level of internal technological competence (Cohen & Levinthal, 1990). This
type of relationship is quite appealing, considering that it contributes to intensify international
competitiveness in enterprises, industries and countries and to solve issues associated to market
failures and technological deficiencies. Cooperation with competitors involves, on the one
hand a reduction in investment risk and market uncertainty, and on the other sharing costs
when enterprises initiate their R&D activities (Harabi, 2002). According to Von Hippel (2005),
enterprises improve products and processes by learning from their competitors, through knowhow exchange.
Nevertheless, there are risks associated with the possibility of competitive behaviour and
spillover of key knowledge to competitors (Miotti & Sachwald, 2003). Therefore, cooperation is
more likely to occur either in protected areas, or sharing knowledge that is not vital. Enterprises
avoid areas that may raise competition and favour cooperation on solving common issues
(Tether, 2002; Cassiman & Veugelers, 2002) such as collaborating on basic research/projects or
establishing standards in the sector (Tether, 2002).

Consultants and experts
Suppliers
The relationship with suppliers is also considered as a vertical or non-competitive cooperation.
It is a fact that enterprises have increased their relationships with their suppliers from the 1980s,
mainly because of Japanese car and electronics successful relationship in developing innovations
(Bidault et al., 1998). According to Håkansson and Eriksson (1993), suppliers are base factors of
business. These players can be a source of innovative ideas and critical technologies considering
that suppliers have specific knowledge and competencies.
In countries like the United Kingdom and United States, large enterprises that choose to
downsize and concentrate on core competences, have increased their collaboration with these
agents to guarantee a supply of quality inputs. The high degree of efficiency attained is one of
the main reasons for cooperating with suppliers in terms of new products or processes (Tether
2002; Bayona et al. 2003; Santamaría & Rialp 2007). Suppliers are the partners of choice when
the enterprise’s objectives have a commercial nature, such as entering new markets or internationalization (Bayona et al. 2001, Santamaría & Rialp, 2007). These agents not only assist the
development of products and processes, quality improvement and market adaptation, but also
productivity and flexibility. Reduction of production costs is another reason to cooperate with
suppliers, likewise costs and risks involved in new product development (Chung & Kim, 2003).

Innovation for Resilience

Enterprises tend to seek alternative sources of knowledge and information when the
development of innovations is affected, in particular when it is not evolving as fast as needed or
does not correspond to enterprise’s expectations. Thus, consultants and experts are a suitable
solution (Tether, 2002). These agents are a source of specialized knowledge and skills that
provide a wide range of valuable inputs for innovation development.
Consultants and experts render possible experience sharing, concerning the definition and
articulation of specific innovation needs, offer ideas on new needs and solutions, or even allow
idea transfer among enterprises (Bessant & Rush, 1995). Besides, these agents can bring to the
enterprise different points of view as they are not familiar with its products and processes, since
the enterprise staff can sometimes be an obstacle to new ideas. The contributions brought by
this type of agents have encouraged a growth in the number of effective innovative ideas (Bruce
& Morris, 1998).

Universities and research institutes
A common form of partnership is the cooperation with scientific agents, particularly in
science-based firms (Castro & Fernández, 2006). Universities and research institutes have an
important role in the development of technological innovations, contributing to new scientific
and technological knowledge (Drejer & Jorgensen, 2005). This type of collaboration does not
83

bring any type of commercial risk, unlike cooperation with competitors, as it is focused on
generating R&D knowledge of a basic or generic nature and not introducing it in the market
(Miotti & Sachwald, 2003). Cooperation with universities is a way of sharing costs as it exploits
knowledge which is publically available.
Universities, as well as their research institutes, are constantly creating and developing
scientific knowledge. As research in firms intensifies it becomes very expensive, then specialized
academic knowledge is brought to balance and complement the firm’s R&D in order to gain
access to rising technologies and achieve technological discovers that lead to distinctive
commercial products (Spencer, 2003). Probably, one of the reasons why enterprises chose this
source may be to benefit from public funds destined to research (Bayona et al., 2001; Cassiman
& Veugelers, 2002; Miotti & Sachwald, 2003; Fontana et al., 2006). It is quite usual for policymakers the encouragement of the relationship between enterprises and research institutes as a
mandatory requisite to subsidize projects with public funds.
Although cooperation with these agents is very useful, enterprises must have an important
in-house R&D capability in order to absorb the scientific knowledge generated (Cohen &
Levinthal, 1990). Although universities and their research institutes are acknowledged as key
players in new product development, their role in the innovation process is not yet totally
clarified (Reichstein & Salter, 2006).

Research framework
The first step will be to identify the sectors of Portuguese economy more willing to engage
in cooperation initiatives in order to accomplish innovation. Secondly, a more detailed analysis
on the scale and scope of their cooperation is developed, i.e., which sources and/or agents they
mostly use (scope) and with which relative intensity (scale).

The CIS instrument and sampling
For this study a secondary dataset was used from the CIS-2012 (DGEEC, 2014). The CIS,
operation acronym in the Eurostat for Community Innovation Survey, is the main statistical
survey (mandatory for EU member states) on innovation in companies. European Union
employs this main statistical instrument to monitor Europe’s progress in the area of innovation,
which is conducted by national statistical offices. In Portugal, following the methodological
recommendations of Eurostat, the CIS aims to directly collect information on innovation
(product, process, marketing, and organizational) in companies. Data collection, corresponding
to the period of 2010-2012, was performed during 2014 through an online electronic platform.
The universe contemplates Portuguese companies with 10 or more employees belonging to the
NACE codes (economic activities) in Table 2. The sample consisted of 9423 companies, based on
census combination (for companies with 250 or more persons employed) and random sampling
for other companies. Of the 7995 companies of the corrected sample, 6840 valid answers were
considered corresponding to a response rate of 86%.
Innovation for Resilience

The CIS instrument provides useful information on how firms interrelated with its surrounding
external environment in order to access information considered important for the development
of new innovation projects or the completion of existing ones. Firms may use external agents
as information sources or engage in more formal cooperation activities, meaning their active
participation with other enterprises or institutions on innovation accomplishments.

Conceptualisation
The nature of innovation
Product (good or service) innovation
This study focuses on product and process innovations. The CIS instrument considers that
product innovation occurs when a firm introduces to the market a new or significantly improved
good or service with respect to its capabilities, technical specifications, user friendliness,
components or sub-systems. Improved good or service does not need to be new to the market;
however it must be new to the firm and it should not matter if it was originally developed by
the firm or by other external partners.
85

It is considered that product innovation occurs if the firm answered positively to one of the
two questions in Table 3. In consequence, these two variables were transformed into a single
variable named product/service innovation (INOV_PRD_SRV) with a 0=”No”; 1=”Yes” coding.

Process innovation
Process innovation occurs when a firm implements a new or significantly improved production
process, or new and significantly improved method of supplying services, or supporting activity
(Table 4). Purely organizational or managerial changes are excluded. This innovation does not
need to be new to market; however, it must be new to the firm not mattering if it was originally
developed by the firm or by other external partners.
Table 4 – Variables for process innovation

The nature of the innovation process
Firms were asked about the way product and process innovations have been developed.
To the question: “Who developed the innovation”, four possible answers were available: (1)
The firm; (2) The firm in cooperation with other firms or institutions; (3) The firm adopting or
modifying goods or services originally developed by other firms or institutions; (4) Other firms
or institutions.
An objective of this work is to identify the sectors that most engage in cooperation initiatives
in order to accomplish innovation. Thus, we distinguished between ‘cooperation-based
innovators’ and ‘firm-based innovators’. Table 5 gives the frequencies for these variables (with
a 0=”No”; 1=”Yes” coding). The percentages indicate the proportion of firms with positive
answers. And the innovation rate is given by the ratio between the number of innovative firms
(implementing a product or process innovation) and the total number of sample firms.
We are excluding the adoption of innovation developed by others. Although being important
to measure knowledge diffusion, it is not relevant for the purpose of this investigation as well as
not very representative in our sample.

It was considered that the firm really implemented a process innovation if it answered
positively to one of those three questions. Then, these three variables were transformed into a
single variable named process innovation (INOV_PROC) with a 0=”No”; 1=”Yes” coding.

Innovation for Resilience

These percentages show that process innovation is more developed than product
innovation. This incidence could be related to the present economic crisis, the worst influences
of which began in 2008. With lower investments, product/service innovations were most likely
postponed. However, investigation of other CIS periods will be necessary for more accurate
longitudinal discussions. And firm-based innovation is higher than cooperation-based initiatives
for both types of innovation. Especially in product innovation, firms tend to be more cautious
and reluctant to cooperate as it concerns the exposure of potentially profitable new products.
Findings reveal that many Portuguese firms are still closed to internal resources, missing several
opportunities (Chesbrough 2003a; Laursen & Salter 2006).
Bigger firms, with head offices abroad, use both internal and external environments
more often (Rigby & Zook 2002; Navarro 2002) achieving successful innovations (Cohen &
Levinthal 1990). Outsiders can provide diverse solutions to complex problems and foster
combined innovation to generate new ideas and applications, influencing a firm’s ability to
innovate positively. The trend is towards open innovation due to crises, globalization, Internet
potential and innovation sustainability. The uniqueness and multi-functionality of products and
experiences require specialized competencies that experts must deliver. Thus, partnerships and
other integrated initiatives and information are fundamental.

Portugal

The following table (Table 6) shows the percentages obtained for cooperation and firm-based
innovation by sector and type of innovation. Thus, the sectors that most innovate are Computer
manufacturing, electronic and optical products; insurance, reinsurance and pension funding and
scientific research and development (R&D). The sectors that most cooperate for innovation purposes are insurance, reinsurance and pension funding followed by retail trade and then computer
manufacturing, electronic and optics. However, firm-based innovation is higher than cooperation-based innovation for the majority of sectors in both types, especially in product innovation.
Firms tend to be more open to collaborate with others when there is no new product involved.

According to the design of CIS, firms may cooperate with different partners such as:
other firms in the group; suppliers; customers; competitors; consultants; universities and R&D
laboratories. And the geographical scale of cooperation may vary, as cooperation can be
developed with: Portuguese partners; European partners; USA; China/India or others. However
the following figures show that there is a focus on national partners.
Besides identifying the sectors more willing to engage in cooperation initiatives in order
to innovate (Table 6), the following charts allow comparing the cooperation sources/ agents
used by sector (scope) and relative intensity of use (scale). In the computer sector (Figure 1),
whose incidence is in firm-based product innovation, the external sources/ agents most used
are universities and R&D labs, followed by suppliers and private customers. This could be related
to the previously referred reluctance of exposing new ideas/products to concurrence.

In the civil engineering sector (Figure 2), whose incidence is in cooperation-based process innovation, the external sources/agents most used are universities and competitors, followed by other
group firms. Indeed, civil engineering enterprises count on their firms’ group for expanding and
sharing costs. Competitors can be a useful source or cooperating agent for creativity, knowledge
transfer and internationalization. And these goals can be attained through process innovation.

In the retail trade sector (Figure 3), whose incidence is in firm-based process innovation, the
external sources/agents most used are other group firms, suppliers and private customers. Many
times, retail trade enterprises innovate in services and supporting processes (orders, delivery,
cross-selling, after-sales, online shopping, etc.). And increasingly they develop innovations based
on private customers’ suggestions and contributions (even through social networks). Suppliers
are also an important source/agent of information and market penetration.

In the insurance sector (Figure 4), whose incidence is in cooperation-based product
innovation, the external sources/agents most used are suppliers, followed by private customers
and competitors. Like consultancy, these firms can provide a stream of innovations to clients
which need external expert knowledge to face trends of business dynamics (McKenna 2006).
In this kind of sectors, strong interactions between providers and customers arise where each
transaction is tailored to their needs. As knowledge-intensive services, they provide innovations
to several agents who need expert knowledge to face business challenges. Thus, partnerships
and other integrated initiatives and information are fundamental (Cesário et al., 2015).

In the R&D sector (Figure 5), whose incidence is in firm-based product innovation, the
external sources/agents most used are universities and private customers, followed by R&D
labs. As in the computer sector, with the same incidence and sources/agents used, this could be
related to the referred reluctance of exposing new products to concurrence.

From these figures, we can acknowledge that main innovating sectors in the Portuguese
economy are research-based (computer, civil engineering, R&D) or knowledge-based (insurance,
health) or service-based (retail trade). The external sources/agents most commonly used by the
first are universities, suppliers by the second and firms’ group by the third. Private customers
are important sources for all types of sectors, what means that Portuguese firms generally use
customers’ information and relations for innovation purposes. These results are in line with
the fact that Portuguese economy is mainly based on small and medium-sized firms (SME)
which increasingly focus on services and knowledge. Customers’ data allow to expand the
knowledge-base within their applied research and to materialize knowledge into goods and
services. Cooperation with customers endorse firms to develop R&D activities which involve the
search for solutions to specific problems that affect the firms’ core business areas (SánchezGonzález & Herrera, 2014).

Conclusion
The present research aims identifying the sectors of Portuguese economy more involved in
cooperation to accomplish innovation. After appraising the nature of the innovation process in
terms of cooperation or firm-based innovation, a more detailed analysis on the scale and scope
of cooperation is developed, i.e., an assessment of the sources and/ or agents Portuguese firms
most use (scope) and with which relative intensity (scale).
Findings reveal that main innovating sectors in the Portuguese economy are research-based,
knowledge-based and service-based. The external sources/agents most commonly used by the
first are universities, suppliers by the second and firms’ group by the third. Private customers
are important sources for all types of sectors, what means that Portuguese firms generally
use customers’ information and relations for innovation purposes. These results corroborate
the fact that Portuguese firms are mainly small and medium-sized and increasingly focus on
services and knowledge.
In present economies firms need to balance internal sources and competences with ideas
from outside and interact with a large number of players (Lundvall, 2010; Laursen & Salter,
2006). This is the main strength of the open innovation model in which external knowledge
connections are a vital factor and a complement to internal research (Chesbrough et al., 2006).
However Portuguese firms are less mature in open innovation comparing to other European
countries. For instance, an attribute of the ‘sixth generation’ model of innovation (Kotsemir &
Meissner, 2013) is the strategic integration with competitors1. Nevertheless, this cooperation
agent is used by few sectors of the Portuguese economy, as our results illustrate. Also the
firms’ capacity to explore the knowledge provided by external agents depends on the openness
toward new opportunities which, in turn, depends on the firm’s knowledge stock and on the
qualification of its employees (Pinto et al., 2015).
An interesting initiative that has been stimulating the propensity of Portuguese firms for
open innovation are the innovation accelerator programs (for start-ups’ launching and support).
Facing the increasingly dynamic economy, diverse partners can provide solutions to complex
problems, foster combinatorial innovation and share risks and costs of radical innovations. Open
innovation is crucial due to crises, globalization, internet potential and innovation sustainability.
This model of innovation can create conditions for uniqueness and multi-functionality of
products and services. From 2008 a global crisis influenced Portugal’s economy, affecting many
firms. Future research should explore this topic using other CIS datasets and other sectors to

Introduction

Reichstein, T. & Salter, A. (2006) Investigating the sources of process innovation among UK manufacturing
firms. Industrial Corporate Change, 15, 653-682.

In Portugal, mountainous areas, similarly to the ones of the Mediterranean basin, were
characterized, for several decades, by intense agricultural, forestry and herding activities, based
on territorial ranking in order to extract maximum productivity (MacDonald et al. 2000; Nunes,
2008; Arnaez et al., 2011). In fact, physical and natural constraints (the irregularity of the
main climate elements, the steep slopes, nutrient poor soils, among others) alongside with
the population rout from the rural and agricultural space and, more recently, the European
Union’s (EU) agricultural policies promoted the breakdown of the productive system and the
massive abandonment of traditional agricultural activities. The subsidiary contribution of these
spaces in the economic development process - before the incapacity for adaptation to the
new rules established by the markets, due to a set of structural strangling, such as the afore
mentioned - dictated its marginalization in regards to the decision and consumption centers.
This socioeconomic system would come to fall apart with the integration of rural environment
in a competitive market directed and controlled by urban areas, operated in Western Europe,
whose historic landmark is located in the post-II World War.
Even though the decline of agricultural, herding and forestry activities in the mountain,
the residents of the low lands have demonstrated great interest by some of the outputs of the
systems for resource’s use, stressing several local products as meats, cheeses, sausages, honey
or nuts. On the other hand, the heritage wealth of the Portuguese lands, specially highlighting
Serra da Estrela, with a broad set of touristic resources due to its natural conditions and cultural
heritage, constitutes now a centre of attention.
In this context, the sustainable development of these territories and of the respective local
communities depends on its ability to adapt before the large evolving trends of economic,
social, environmental, political or technological matrix, according to the perspective of strategic
resilience. In Serra da Estrela, the LEADER+ strategy has been rolling around the existence of
important and diverse natural, landscaping, cultural, gastronomy and heritage resources, as
well as through the valuing of local quality products. As general goals it targets the settling of
local population; the strengthening of regional identity; the valuing of endogenous resources;
the development of the capacities for attraction; the revitalization of local communities; the

Innovation for Resilience

increase of the quality of life for local populations and the promotion of “Serra da Estrela
products”.
Thus, the construction of more resilient territories can be a path towards the stimulation
of a development that is more sustainable and more adequate to the great evolving trends
and its impacts. As mentioned by Santos (2009), resilient territories are territories that are less
vulnerable and more prepared to deal with change, complexity, crisis and multiple disturbances
(of economic, environmental, technological, social or political character), avoiding disruptions
and collapses, thus being more sustainable in the long run. Resilience is, mainly, a way to think
and plan the future in a logic of adaptation and valuing of territories.
Regions, just like communities, companies or states, need a prodigious capacity for
adaptation in order to face problems and disturbances that are coupled successfully through
time, in order to minimize its impacts that, when they are extreme, may lead to disruptions
and collapses. Building social and ecological resilience, thus, requires the understanding of the
ecosystems it incorporates from local users (Berkes and Folke, 1998). In the same way, the
combination of different types and systems of knowledge can increase resilience at a local
scale (Davidson-Hunt and Berkes, 2003). In contrast, the lack of attention and sensitivity for
local knowledge can increase the vulnerability of population and property. Longworth (2006)
considers that what is at stake is mainly the concept of social learning that can be defined as the
capacity of societies and communities to learn collectively and share common knowledge, goals
and responsibilities for its future development. On the other hand, a growing number of case
studies revealed a narrow connection between resilience, diversity and sustainability of social
and ecological systems (Berkes and Folke 1998, Adger et al. 2001).
This study intends to: (a) analyze the socio-economic trajectories of a mountain territory,
giving particular emphasis to the municipality of Manteigas, located in the heart of the Serra
da Estrela massif; (b) understand in what way the installation of the company “Casa das Penhas
Douradas”, in the municipality, through valuing of human resources and potentialities of this
territory, constitutes a structuring element of the respective social and ecological resilience.
The methodology used was centred in the information collection, mainly statistical, regarding
the sociodemographic trajectory of the studied municipality, from the 1960’s until today. The
information regarding Casa das Penhas Douradas was obtained through a semi-structured/
oriented interview with the respective owners, consolidated with data and dissemination
sources of the respective company. Aiming to understand the Casa das Penhas Douradas
installation impact and subsequent business niches in the territory they dwell, it was applied an
inquiry by closed answer questionnaire online to the workers of this company (in a total of 35
answers – 87.4% of workers) in order to assess the expected individual course, in case they were
not working for this company.

Innovation for Resilience

Study Area: The Municipality of Manteigas in Serra da Estrela
It is estimated that mountain areas occupy around 18% of the national Portuguese territory,
from which 11% are above 600 meters of altitude and only 0.5% above 1100 meters of altitude
(Cunha, 2003). The 1960´s marked the progressive abandonment of mountain spaces, modifying
its territorial reorganization. These areas started to be characterized by a strong demographic
regression that resulted in low population densities (Saraiva, 2012) and difficulties in its physical
and economic growth. The imbalances of population and economic structure caused exclusion
and territorial marginalization. These development ruptures lead these spaces to crisis situations.
On the other hand these transformations broke the autonomy of mountain communities who,
until then, presented solid relations of cohesion and solidarity (Fernandes, 2009). In this regard,
Caeiro (2009: 19) refers to the mountain as “a socially built space, in which local communities
develop their own ways of exploitation of the resources available in Nature, in a sustainable
manner, bearing in mind the historical, technical, economic and social context in which they
take place”.
This way, the mountain is used as a target by users who promoted changes in the social
structure and in the, thus far, prevalent traditional organization. The rediscovery of the
potentialities associated to these spaces provides a growing touristic attraction, in which a
greater availability of time, economic resources, means of transportation and leisure equipment
attract more and more population (Fernandes, 2009). Nowadays a more and more environmental
and cultural valuing of mountain areas is being recorded, developing new uses and expectations,
mainly related to tourism.
Cravidão and Cunha (1994: 90) mention that “tourism, a privileged form of profitability
of depressed rural spaces and answer to the desires and expectations of development for its
populations, should be properly framed in territorial ordinance plans have into account not only
interests in several areas of economic development, but also the needs for preservation of the
quality of environmental conditions, i.e., allowing the recovery and economic development of
spaces sometime inhospitable and almost repulsive, but without being transposed the thresholds
for tolerance of the physical-natural conditions that question the own survival of tourism.”
The municipality of Manteigas, located in the central part of the Serra da Estrela massif
(Figure 1) and completely integrated in the Serra da Estrela Natural Park, concentrates a set of
features from a physical and human point of view, that have scarred not only landscapes but
also its development strategies. The shapes of tectonic actions of the Hercynian and Alpine
cycles (Carrola, 2013), the traces of Würm glaciation, particularly the Zêzere glacial valley, the
moraine ridges, caves and nunataks and the presence of a rich and differentiated biodiversity,
due to its altimetry and bioclimatic features, which are some of the elements which structure
the individuality of this area. The physical structure of the municipality is patent in its people
and in the activities they developed throughout time. This may be one of the major factors in
the social, economic and demographic evolution of this site.

Burel Factory

The period after 1960 brought key transformations to the socioeconomic and demographic
structure. The exit of population to urban areas (emigration and inland migrations towards, especially, Lisbon Metropolitan Area) resulted in a demographic decline (in 2011 the municipality
had 3430 inhabitants), to which was associated aging (aging index of 288.1% in 2011), which
may explained, in part, by a low birth rate (4.1‰ in 2011). At the economic level, this regressive
dynamics had its major impact in the reduction of the active population (activity rate of approximately 38% in 2011) (Table 1). Besides, the transformations in national economy were also
reflected in the loss of the supremacy of the primary sector, while the tertiary sector increased
its weight. CAP and national strategies for rural areas and mountain areas increased the expansion of multifunctionality of these spaces, in which tourism, heritage valuing and potential of
endogenous products as elements of differentiation and territorial marketing, gain emphasis.

Similarly to most of the mountain environments in Portugal, human presence has caused clear
tensions regarding the concerns with environmental preservation, but depopulation has been
increasing its exposure, due to abandonment of traditional activities essential to the preservation
of the diversity of ecosystems (PTD 2007). In fact, demographic and economic trajectories can
be divided in two main stages based on the differentiated behaviour before and after the
1960’s. Between 1864 and 1960, the municipality presented a positive demographic evolution,
growing from 2855 to 6276 inhabitants. The trademark rurality of the territory conditioned the
economic activities to the primary sector, where herding was more evident. In 1960, this sector
employed around 43% of the employed population. It is followed by the secondary sector based
on activities related to the transformation of natural products. According to Saraiva (2012) the
textile industry presents as the main economic source of the 20th century for the population
in the municipality of Manteigas. Wool gained a major importance as raw material, leading
to the development of the wool textile manufacture in the region. In that year, 29% of the
whole economic activities and around 73% of the activities integrated in the secondary sector
corresponded to that industrial sector. In fact, the wool manufacture were the major propellers
of the economy in Serra da Estrela, and in particular of Manteigas, until the end of last century,
a time when the region lost its productive competiveness to other areas, with the closure of
almost every factory and consequently with the increase of unemployment.

At the same time, the crisis in the textile industry did not only imply an increase in unemployment as it also hampered the reinstatement of lowly qualified people back to the active life
(PTD 2007). The once main employing industry in the municipality is nowadays reduced to a
handful of small artisanal units. From that peak period of the textile industry, only a few artisans
and small companies remained trying to survive by using wool and burel in a traditional form
(Jacinto and Alves, 2013).
These development trajectories placed the municipality in a situation of social and economic
vulnerability. The aged and low qualified human capital and the economics that tends to
restructure, now based in local potential like the promotion of tourism, comes with new
problems: the economic seasonality caused by the association of the municipality (and Serra
da Estrela) to snow tourism and a certain inertia regarding the introduction of innovation and
difficulties of creative options turn Manteigas less competitive and resilient. The introduction of
exogenous capital both by the settling capacity of younger population who is still in the territory
101

and by the capture of new agents and new investments, from which the hereby presented
case study is an example, might become elements of possible increase of local resilience, thus
contributing for the reorientation of local development trajectories.

Figure 2 – Process of resilience: interactive elements in mountain rural areas

Vulnerability vs Resilience in Mountain Territories
In fact, thinking in the municipality of Manteigas is thinking in a low density territory, with an
eccentric position, almost remote, associated to the physical characteristics of mountain areas.
In socioeconomic terms, one of the preeminent elements in approaching resilient territories,
the municipality also presents some weaknesses: the loss of the herding supremacy, which was
followed by the loss of expression of the textile industry, triggered very significant consequences
as to employment, while tourism as a structuring economic activity has not been able, on its
own, of assuring dynamics.
Thus, the Manteigas municipality presents itself in a context of vulnerability, i.e., having as
base the concept of Blaike et al (1994, apud Gardner and Dekens 2007) being exposed to a
set of risks and dangers associated to the competitive (in)capacity of the place in the sense of
attracting actors who enable local development, in which human and social capital demonstrate
a structuring role. The changes in the structure of local economy have passed to local economic
and social structures. The lack of job offers lead to the exit of population to other geographic
areas - national and international. This being a selective migration, it has created an imbalance
in local age structure, with highlight to the reduction of births and population aging. In social
terms, the imbalances were centred in the loss of active population, but mostly in the exit of the
more qualified population, with more innovative potential. The ones who stayed are elder, less
literate and less qualified. The exceptions come in the particular cases of younger population
who, despite having some qualification and relatively higher levels of teaching (a few times
reaching higher education), due to the external environment – the 2008 crisis and the growing
unemployment and depreciation of life conditions – ended up remaining in the municipality for
the financial and housing support offered by the respective parents.
However, one may not forget that the settlement and potentiation of human and social
capital will depend on the context of the environment at the level of elements such as
environmental capital – pleasantness for the settlement – the cultural capital – creation of more
(in)formed resources – and economic capital – in fact what may weigh more in the settlement
of population, being a primary resource for employment and individual sustainability.
Resilience depends on a set of elements that constitute as territorial resources for change,
highlighting the aforementioned economic capital, human and social capitals, cultural capital
and the environmental capital (Sánchez-Zamora et al 2014) (Figure 2). That is, local resources
must be potentiated in the sense of rehabilitation regarding a socioecological imbalance, valuing
localisms as potential competiveness factor.

Economic capital is one of the more relevant elements in the creation of resilient territories in
the sense it integrates a set of discerned factors, but substantially linked to investment, employment and all the infrastructures (physical and organizational) of the business. Theoretically, a
territory will be more resilient as the economic capital is denser, more diversified and solid. That
is, a larger number of companies, with a larger diversity of offers, may result in a larger local
investment, while making possible to reduce the impacts of shocks/economic crisis by multifunctionality. On the other hand, this density and diversity will create the need to provide the
space with infrastructures of support to the economic activity and, therefore, in local employment. However, this physical structure is as resilient as the partnership relations created and the
density and distance of topologic networks are larger, in the logic of the theory of strong and
weak bonds (Granovetter, 1983).
In Portugal, in rural areas and particularly in mountain areas, there are mainly small
companies, many times family businesses, with no large network organization support and with
an area of acting reduced to everyday services or specific rarer offers, associated to activities of
leisure and tourism. This is, without a doubt, one of the weak spots of these spaces concerning
the elements of territorial resilience.
Human capital is recognized as the key to resilience processes, taking effective relevance in
the context of transformation of rural areas, and mountain areas in particular. The demographic
structure, levels of education and qualification of the population, besides opening to innovation,
the contact with other realities and, in a last instance, entrepreneurship, determine the larger
capacity of a territory to adapt to crisis situations, being more open to changes. Also here rural
areas and, in particular, mountain areas, being more remote, face a set of problems associated
to the demographic regression that has been felt since the 20th century. Social capital, on its
turn, concerns the established organization relations. A more resilient territory will be the one
103

that presents greater autonomy, cooperation and efficiency in its institutional structures, being
fundamental the constitution of partnerships and the instauration of work networks for a
cooperative, volunteer and accountable development process.
This is an aspect that is already being worked by low density territories and, especially, by the
actors with the biggest roles in development processes (Covas and Covas, 2014). The perception
of the increase of competitiveness through network effort encourages the settlement of
different types of cooperation, with particular highlight to the producers (with its more usual
and primary version in agricultural cooperatives) and local companies that try to increase in
competitiveness through the widening of the offer through an association of partners. However,
these topological, physical and institutional relations must be potentiated at the level of Euclidian
broadening who also supports the network spaces, in the sense of acquiring new territorialities,
new markets and also new elements of connection. On the other hand, social innovation, in
the sense of the constitution of new forms of organization, cooperation and institutional work,
must also be stimulated, especially fostering an active governance.
However, if the three afore mentioned elements of resilience are found still as problems in
the constitution of resilient rural and mountain territories, when approaching the cultural and
environmental capital, the issue stops being the (in)existence to being the way to potential
and value the endogenous resources. In fact, these areas are rich in cultural heritage (material
and immaterial) that can be used economically, both through the revitalization of the ancient
know-how, peculiar of each specific geographic area, in the sense of traditional production,
introducing an innovation factor that attribute greater innovation, both by the use to service
offering, very much linked to the tourism activity and leisure times, and by the production
of commercial and exportable products. On the other hand, the location of these spaces
grants them physical peculiarities (biodiversity, geology, geomorphology, hydrology) that
can be worked from the leisure-tourism point of view, but mostly from the point of view of
environmental preservation and awareness, by the constitution of reserve spaces, that allow, at
the same time, and experience of knowledge and contact with the environment, while being
used as research areas and production activities (agricultural, forestry, energetic).
In reality, it is in this area that the Manteigas municipality is highlighted. At a cultural level,
for the identity particularities linked, mostly, to herding, whether in the harsh work throughout
the mountain, whether for the art of cheese making and the work in wool transformation. At
the environmental level, for its location in the highest mountain in continental Portugal, with
traces of Würm glaciation, and a biodiversity protected by the figure of the Serra da Estrela
Natural Park.
So, a resilient territory needs the combination of all these elements in an integrated,
collaborative and interdisciplinary manner, aiming a sustainable development (Santos, 2009),
potentiated by the flexibility, adaptability, competitiveness and cohesion. Besides, the
construction of resilience goes through processes like learning and diversification, alongside
the use of endogenous knowledge, the capability of reorganization and the establishment of
networks and partnerships (Gardner and Dekens 2007) (Figure 3).
Learning is a starting point for the change process inherent to resilience. Firstly it should be
based on previous crisis situations, i.e., the errors from the past must be taken as examples for
future progress. On the other hand, the settlement of weaker bonds (Granovetter 1983) will
Innovation for Resilience

allow the creation of knowledge networks that will simplify the exchange of experiences, in a
logic of valuing of good practices, which may be a good starting point for the creation of more
proactive territories (Santos 2011).
The creation of weak bonds provides the need to generate partnerships that promote
the logics of topological spatiality. The establishment of institutional relations is an essential
component to the mitigation of socio-ecological impacts, still contributing to an improvement
after these periods, thus being a fundamental piece in the construction of resilience. “[…]
external linkages and partnership do provide a medium through with resources and assistance
flow to the affected are and populations in the event of disaster” (Gardner and Dekens 2007:326).
Figure 3 – Process of resilience: dynamics in creation of resilient territories

However, the capacity for resilience is not exclusively dependent of the relations with partners.
The capacity for self-organization or post-crisis reorganization also becomes fundamental.
We refer to the capacity of a territory to establish institutions, to have players and organisms
that mitigate the effects of a crisis and generate change, turning once again the human and
social capital into a relevant role. However, more than a reactive position, these organisms and
institutions must present as actors of anticipation, i.e., actors who promote change before the
mentioned crisis takes place.
105

In this sense, endogenous knowledge is fundamental. On one hand, the experience in perceiving the territory simplifies the preview and perception of the changing socio-ecological
system’s functioning. Afterwards, local knowledge, in the sense of the endogenous potential
for use of resources and establishment of competitiveness for the differentiation becomes important when thinking, for example, in the specific case of the Manteigas municipality, in the
work with wool or cheese, as cultural heritage to be transmitted to new generations, for the
perpetuation of an identity brand.
To these four elements it is added the issue of diversity. A socially and economically diverse
territory creates opportunities of choice assuring the continuity of the system when one of
its components collapses and fails. In mountain areas [they] “provide livelihood options in
the form cash employment that can supplement or supersede traditional practices. Tourism
livelihood is an example. These opportunities increase income and diversity livelihood options
that in combination enhance resilience, however, over-reliance in new opportunities, such as
tourism, without attention to diversity may lead to increased vulnerability to hazards” (Gardner
and Dekens 2007:324).
Being territorial resilience the capacity for a territory to recover its dynamic state and find
a new path after a disturbance of its environment, there is an important effort by local actors
in materializing actions to solve the problem. In this sense, each actor must also be resilient.
So, it concerns organizational resilience, a continuous capability of reconstruction through
answering or anticipating internal or external shocks based in the creation of centring and
authority systems, rationalization of financial management and human resources, development
of new marketing strategies, innovation and diversification of the product/service offers. Here,
resilience may only translate into skill, through the existence of stable organization structures, to
absorb shocks or, in a situation of lesser stability and density of the corporate system, through
the need to create new products and new market strategies (Gilly et al 2014).
However, it is not possible that dynamic companies/organizations exist in territories that are
not dynamic, and vice-versa (Gilly et al 2014). The mentioned characteristics contribute to the
weak capacity of resilience from Manteigas municipality. In this sense, the dynamics inherent to
any actor of local development and more specifically a corporate actor will arise in a logical of a
pilot experience. It is in this context that “Casa das Penhas Douradas” arises.

expressive dimension), privileging, more than profit, the pleasure for the work developed and
the way of life.
The good results obtained in the first four years lead to the need of a widening the business’
dimension, in this concrete case to the extension of the touristic equipment, from 9 to 18
bedrooms, yet including a SPA (from the Latin salute per aquam) and achieving a hotel rate of 4
stars. The perception of the quality of the endogenous resources leads to a reflection from the
local actors about the potential use, from the reactivation of the local dynamics’ point of view,
trying to become Manteigas more attractive and competitive. Taking advantage of the hotel’s
closure during the works of extension and being aware of the importance of the integration
of the several local actors, given the company is included in a territory where it is a support of
the activity, the owners of Casa das Penhas Douradas, in contact with the local government,
promoted a workshop on endogenous products and innovation in the municipality of Manteigas
and Serra da Estrela.
It was intended the participation of the whole local community, in a logic of active gover­
nance associated to local authorities, to which was associated a set of senior consultants (e.g.
BCG – Portugal and Deloitte). With the epithet “knowledges and techniques of the village” the
goal of that meeting was the identification of business projects (20 overall) that, from the endogenous resources, could boost the municipality and widen its economic offering.
However, that meeting, despite well accepted by local actors, ended up not having visible
practical consequences. Only the owners of the Casa das Penhas Douradas, a few months
after, rethought the ideas debated in that workshop and contemplated one more business
opportunity: the use of typical food products of the municipality and of the region and the
burel. So, in 2010, Penhas Douradas Food and Penhas Douradas Factory come to life. These
two small businesses were added to the hotel’s existing offer, already diversified due to the
introduction of the SPA and a congress/meeting room in the hotel equipment and to the set of
activities that can be developed by tourists (hiking/MTB/jeep tours, themed workshops, small
forestry activities). It was then initiated a process of training at the resilience level, based on
diversification, environmental capital and cultural capital.

The endogenous potential: innovation and specialization

“Casa das Penhas Douradas”: An Innovative Company in a Territory in
Regression
Casa das Penhas Douradas comes to life in 2006, as Rural Space Tourism, an initiative of two
allochthones who decided to invest in the municipality attracted by the richness, natural beauty
and culture of the region, but mostly due to the need of changing the sense of their everyday
lives. In fact, the dynamics of the municipality does not enable attractiveness in the logic of the
creation of a business with large profits. On the contrary, it promotes expectations at the level of
improvement of the quality of life, through the perception of a healthier everyday life, especially
for the possibility of contact with Nature. It was in that sense that these two investors left their
jobs, not at all related to tourism or mountain, and their area of residence an (urban area of
Innovation for Resilience

The diversification implemented by Casa das Penhas Douradas comes from the acknowle­
dgement of the endogenous potential as promoting element of the economic dynamics. Firstly,
the expansion of the own hotel is inserted in a logic of integration in the physical surroundings
(Serra da Estrela) being, at the same time, impregnated of a set of elements of local identity.
The hotel results from the rehabilitation of an ancient sanatorium, telling the story of Penhas
Douradas as touristic resort of healing associated to climatotherapy.
Casa das Penhas Douradas recovers the health logics, not just by healing illness but in the
sense of prevention, with the aim of offering well-being and quality of life, by introducing the
SPA component in the equipment’s offer. On the other hand, the hotel has not lost the local
architectural trace, using the structuring lines and materials and transforming them with a
modern design.
107

At the same time, its location (in the heart of the Serra da Estrela Natural Park) impels the
obligation of integrating the mountain and respecting it, throughout the whole equipment. It
is witnessed an attempt to have the mountain inside the house, whether for the building’s own
structure, in which the wide glass areas allow panoramic views for the involving space, whether
for the use of colours, aromas and decorative materials. We mention the birch used in the
furniture, the coating of the SPA’s floor in white quartz, the aromas brought for the massage
oils or for the teas and biscuits, or the red, green, brown, purple tones that paint the mountain
in the several seasons, expressed in several decorative elements.
This idea of transformation of localisms into products of local promotion, but mostly business
bases, with the introduction of the innovation element, gains, in this case study, major relevance
in the context of extension of the Casa das Penhas Douradas for the smaller transformation
industries – Penhas Douradas Food and Penhas Douradas Factory. In the first case it is the
valuing of local gastronomy with a use of wild product or by-products of agricultural and
herding activity of the municipality and of the mountain and its transformation into gourmet
products, associating the inherent quality to a sellable and visually appealing brand. It starts
being disclosed locally through the hotel’s menu, integrating less exporting products (e.g.
juniper ice cream, rosemary pudding), existing afterwards another range of production with the
sole purpose of selling (e.g. nettle pesto, Serra da Estrela herb jelly, wild honey caramels) which
reaches wider markets.
However, it was in the Penhas Douradas Factory (currently Burel Factory) that a greater
innovation of the endogenous product took place, and also a greater investment from the
owners of Casa das Penhas Douradas. This might have been reflected in a larger impact at the
level of development and dynamics of the municipality. Based on the work of wool transformed
into burel – traditional fabric used in the capes of shepherds, famous for its coarse and rude
look and dark colours – the work of the Burel Factory is, in a first stage, the conception of new
products, with differentiated functions, alongside with the introduction of new colours.
These ideas started being worked in a small studio, which also emerges in the logic of
perception of the need for innovation and recovery of the wool industry still operating in the
municipality (Lanifícios Império). In this context, innovation is materialized, firstly, in a perspective
of social innovation, for the rental of the space in a factory in the beginning of the insolvency
procedure, in order to assure income for the respective owners. At the same time, the excess of
the work force in Lanifícios Império was also absorbed by the small studio of the Burel Factory,
thus stopping an imminent dismissal process.
This initial functional relationship came to extend, later on, whether for the growth of the
Burel Factory whether for the bankruptcy of Lanifícios Império. In practice it was also verified the
purchase of the latter industry by the owners of the Casa das Penhas Douradas, a process which
also had an innovative character given that, apart from the facilities, the Burel Factory acquired
likewise the machinery, raw materials but also a significant part of the employees who were part
of the previous factory unit, and all the orders that were to be delivered to clients.
At a product level, Burel Factory presents innovation in the colour of the burel, which from
black, brown and white now has thirty nine colours (e.g. red, green, blue, pink, yellow), whether
in the textures (16 stitches inspired in the Portuguese tradition and culture), but mostly in the
functionality for which it are made (e.g. fashion accessories, apparel, decoration, toys, office
Innovation for Resilience

materials). In continuity, it is being seen a widening of the offered product and a disaggregation
of brands; Lanifícios Império has left a legacy of teachings and clients that one sees today in the
continuation of the work that goes by the execution of a series of fabric far beyond burel (e.g.
flannel, tartan); the exclusive work of wool results in products of greater simplicity as blankets,
scarves and mufflers, incorporated in a new brand, “Mantecas”.
This diversification goes even further, surpassing the mere work with wool and its derivatives.
The Burel Factory, in the logic of Casa das Penhas Douradas - because it is also associated to the
hotel equipment - develops a set of activities linked to tourism, for the general public and for
the school community in particular. It is the opening of the factory to the public, in the logics
of museology and territorialization of culture and local identities. The factory, for the activity
it develops and for the cultural wealth it encloses, in which the machinery is its most valuable
element, provided there are looms from all generations (the oldest is from the 19th century),
constitutes as an attraction pole to visitors. To all of this it must be added the existence of a
congress hall in the facilities of the Burel Factory, and also a set of events that take place inside
which enable a greater contact with the population (e.g. music concerts).

Human capital and Know-How
Human capital arises, firstly and from the company/business point of view, as potential work
force. The widening and diversification of the offer linked to Casa das Penhas Douradas are felt
in the need to hire more collaborators: from the initial 3 workers in the equipment, today in all
the business niches, the team comprehends 40 workers.
The sociodemographic characteristics that the municipality of Manteigas presents could
signify an obstacle, firstly to hiring and second to business development: generally an older
active population with relatively low qualification levels. To this element joins the fact that the
company’s dimension, on its own, capture allochthone workers, in connection with the social
and economic sense of the owners in wanting to hire population resident in the municipality.
In fact, the analysis to the inquires shows an employed population resident mainly in the
Manteigas municipality – only three workers do not reside officially in the municipality, belonging
to Seia, Esmoriz and Lisbon (Figure 4). With ages between 19 and 65, more than half is 50
years old or more. The prevalence of the female gender may be related to the type of activities
developed, being highly weighed the wool manufacture. Despite the diversity of qualification
levels from the collaborators, the low qualification stand out, with 27 from the 35 inquired
only having completed secondary teaching or a lower level. As an example, 19 collaborators
who only achieved a level equal or lower secondary education. Only 5 of the workers finished a
higher level, being associated to the younger and female population (Table 2).

At the level of distribution of workers in the different business niches, there is a differentiation
of profiles: at the hotel, on one hand, are the younger and more qualified (some of the few
that remained in the municipality), in some cases with higher training, working in a logic of
versatility and rotation of the tasks necessary to the everyday life of the infrastructure, all being
prepared to direct contact with customers, while there are older workers, less qualified, many
of them former factory workers that, being surpluses to the needs of the Burel Factory, were
trained for hotel work; the workers of the burel factory, in general, are older and have less
qualifications but, for the experience of several years working in the wool industry, bear an
important knowledge, which are joined, in a smaller proportion, by younger workers who seek
to learn ways to work with wool.
Casa das Penhas Douradas, as well as the Burel Factory, still have a set of non-affiliated
workers who support in achieving these projects. They are highly trained professionals, almost
always external to the Serra da Estrela region, who cooperate with the company in technical
terms. They are designers, concerning the burel factory and, for example, the chef who structures
the hotel’s menu and coordinated the products of the Penhas Douradas Food.
This diversity of workers increases the degree of the company’s resilience. On one hand, the
technical and more qualified knowledge of the younger group with higher education which
allows the introduction of more creative, innovative elements, as well as presenting a greater skill
for the perception of development trajectories and the pretension of a greater competitiveness.
On the other hand, it is the tacit knowledge of someone who worked several decades with wool
and loom and knows well local products and potentialities.

In this logic, the integration of local human capital, with a practical knowledge, and of human
capital (external) with a technological and scientific knowledge (know-what and know-why),
institutes a factor of competiveness. Thus, the idea of endogenous product transformation, in
the sense of its valuing, taken by a set of technicians and/or more qualified workers, is validated,
adapted or rethought from the knowledge of the workers who show experience in the work
with the raw material and can predict its reaction to a certain process. At the same time, these
workers, less qualified, enter in a learning process, by being confronted with the need to apply
a set of new techniques they have to implement in their work post. The sharing of information
between these two groups of professionals is reflected in an increase in knowledge of the more
qualified group of technicians and stimulates potential new investigations.
This results in innovation, as the combination of the agile work of human capital, the use of
endogenous products and the introduction of new product ideas, corporate organization and
transformation of raw materials. This innovation may translate into the creation of new brands,
but mostly into new forms of selling local products, what, as a consequence, may reflect in the
creation of new images and perceptions of territory that supports this whole process. Besides,
tacit knowledge allied to explicit knowledge, the use of local resources and the recognition of
its versatility, alongside with the introduction of certain types of innovation, turns the company
more capable to predict and react to moments of disturbance in its balance system (Figure 5).

Resilience is also built in the reciprocity of synergies between the different elements that
form the territory. So, apart from human capital in its diversity, as mentioned before, being able
to assure innovation and the creation of resilience for the company, it boosts some resilience
to this capital, while indirectly transforming the municipality’s development strategies. The first
impact of the Casa das Penhas Douradas in the municipal population was expressed in the
reduction of the social problems related to unemployment, due to the creation of jobs. More
than 60% of the inquired were unemployed or at risk of unemployment immediately prior to
being hired by the company. This situation stroke especially the older individuals (50 years old
or more) and, cumulatively, those with lower qualifications (Table 3).
Innovation for Resilience

However, we cannot state convincingly the company’s capability of population settlement
in the territory. Actually, when questioned about the possibility of changing residence in case
they were not employed at Casa das Penhas Douradas, and in the respective business niches,
almost 75% of the inquired intended to remain in the municipality, being immigration a possible
option for only two of the current workers. This attachment to the territory can be seen mostly
in the elderly and less qualified population. In part, that may be related not only to the degree
of affiliation to the place, but mostly to the understanding of a smaller range of options in more
competitive territories and in the risk implied in their exit from the municipality, apart from the
investment already made in the location as permanent residence (e.g. house purchase). However,
there is still a considerable percentage of individuals under 50 years old (8 out of 15 individuals)
who expressed their will to remain in the municipality (Table 4).

However, this permanence in the municipality does not seem to be a factor of resilience,
but a factor of accommodation to crisis situations. It is worth noticing that most individuals
with the previously focused intention had already been in unemployment situations or at risk
of being unemployed. Adding to the low qualifications (Figure 6), it is understood that these
individuals have contributed to the thickening of a local human and social capital with structural
weaknesses – aging, lack of academic qualifications and unemployment.
Besides, not being hired by the Casa das Penhas Douradas would result, from their
perspective, in most cases in the permanence in the municipality (18 individuals), even in
unemployment situations. Only in six cases the residence continuity in Manteigas could be a
result of employment in the municipality. The need to seek work in other geographical areas
would imply, for 8 of the 10 individuals with that answer, the change of residence and the exit
from the municipality to settle residence in other national or international area (Figure 7).
The perpetuation of unemployment periods presents some probability for these individuals: 16 of the 19 individuals indicate the probability of unemployment in case they were not
working at Casa das Penhas Douradas because they had already been in that situation or at
risk prior to being hired. It is the elder population, in which the proximity to retirement and
lower degrees of literacy is an obstacle to changing the work place, functions, adapting to
places different from the everyday life. Besides, given the recent situation of the Portuguese
work market this population presents, as a result of the presented characteristics, marginalized
from the existing employment offers. On the other hand, a more restrictive and heterogeneous group presents a greater probability of adapting to change, by indicating the possibility of
finding work in other national or international areas. They are individuals who, prior to being
hired, have not been unemployed (Figure 8) and whose qualifications are at the level or higher
than the secondary education.

The results obtained, despite the inexistence of a narrow relation with the settlement of
population in Manteigas, again shows the importance of the company in the context of local
employment. In fact, 30 of the 35 inquired claim they would be unemployed (19 answers) or
employed in another municipality (11 answers) if they have not been hired by Casa das Penhas
Douradas in their different business niches. On the other hand, it is witnessed a reintegration and
a capture of population of more advanced age group, with very low qualifications who, with the
closing of the local textile industry, would potentially be in irreversible unemployment situations.
The younger population, with medium or high academic qualifications, by working in Casa
das Penhas Douradas, had the opportunity to remain in the municipality through employment.
Otherwise they would have moved to other geographic areas looking for job or would have
been attached to their origins with no professional occupation and stable income (Table 5).

The creation of partnership and dissemination networks

Figure 9 – Territorial networks of the company by type of relationship

According to Caetano (2003:152), “in order for a local development policy to be efficient it
is convenient that there is a synergy between local, corporate and institutional action. However,
this is only possible when there are ways of concentration, such as planning agreements, and
there are instruments that favour learning and dissemination of knowledge and, still, through
the interaction of the actor”. Granovetter (1983) considers that the individuals with whom
we have “weak tie” relations are important because they connect us with other groups, thus
breaking the configuration of “isolated islands” of clusters and taking the configuration of social
networks. So, the structuring of the several networks builds the difference in and for places
(Pratt in press) and/or companies.
This is the logic that Casa das Penhas Douradas has taken. Firstly, and at a microscale, the
relations between the several acting areas, both for the complementarity of activities – the
Hotel leads tourists into the factory, the factory places its products in the hotel – and for the
cross-over of workers and their requalification in the sense of assurance of employment through
replacement in sectors of greater need. Still at a local scale, networks come in the market
logic, i.e., the client becomes client of a set of local producers, whether through the purchase
of wool to the burel factory, whether to the daily products consumed in the hotel (e.g. food,
hygiene), contributing, while fulfilling its needs, to the continuity of some microbusinesses and
the creation of new dynamics in the municipality’s economy.
At a wider scale, and emphasizing regional synergies, Casa das Penhas Douradas has already
a set of partnerships with other hotel units in the Serra da Estrela region in order to stimulate
the increase of tourists’ stays. It were promoted complementary activities which enable a more
prolonged offer in time and divided by several areas of the mountain, through the articulation
of two or more establishments which work as starting and arrival point between the offered
leisure activities (e.g. Casas da Lapa – Seia). Aiming to further increment the dissemination
of the place, new partnerships are already being made, with new types of establishments –
boutique hotels – in a logic of expansion of the offer, widening of the acting territories and
broadening of the target audience.
Still at a regional level, also the Burel Factory is constituted as a vortex of the network.
On one hand, for the complementarities existing with other specialized industries in working
wool, which develop the initial transformation of the raw material, a task that the factory in
Manteigas does not have the capability to perform. It is the specific case of washing the wool,
which is made in an industry of the Guarda municipality. On the other hand, for the innovative
component the factory presents, implying a constant research at the level of materials and
products resulting from its transformation, thus narrowing the knowledge with science through
the department of Textile Engineering of the University of Beira Interior (UBI).

However, these networks are dispersed in space when connections with more specialized
technicians are promoted. In the case of the burel factory, the collaborations with designers
and architects result in territorial contacts that are expanded to diverse areas in the country like
Lisbon, Oporto, Braga or Coimbra, but also to international spaces such as London. This way,
Innovation for Resilience

119

it begins a process of dissemination of the company and its products given each of the collaborators, not being involved on an exclusive basis and taking part in other projects (individual
or institutionalized) ends up disseminating the concept and products of the Casa das Penhas
Douradas and the Burel Factory in their professional exercise.
It is, in fact, in the context of the dissemination of the products and in a logic of marketing
that the network is expanded and gains vaster Euclidian distances (Figure 9). On one hand
through the stores were the production, not only from Penhas Douradas Food but mainly
from the Burel Factory, reaches its target audience: in which the small factory and hotel stores
evolved to a store in Chiado, Lisbon – Loja da Burel – and through export to a set of international
stores, scattered through various countries: Netherland, Germany, Finland, Belgium, USA, China,
among others. These spaces are joined by the virtual store.
Apart from those, there are occasional episodes of promotion of the hotel, factory and
products, through participation in national and international trade fairs, events or product
exhibitions. The brand Casa das Penhas Douradas/Burel Factory is, still, disseminated by the
projects the company integrates in terms of the decorative and architectural dimension, by
associating to a set of international acting companies, widening their networks by intermediaries
of these partners.
We then verify a social innovation that breaks the traditional logics of low density territories
(associated to isolation), for the adoption of network acting strategies and creation of
partnerships which, at different scales and in several dimensions (Figure 10) turn the company
more capacitated, given it are created multiple acting options while solidifying product export
territories and service dissemination. At the same time, local and regional synergies are created,
contributing to the reinvigoration of the economic and social structures, even backing the
creation of more cohesive, competitive and, therefore, more resilient territories.

dynamics and contributions of partnerships

Final considerations
In the last years, the understanding of the concept “resilience” requires the combined
consideration of fundamental aspects (Pearson 2008): (1) persistence, referring to the capacity
of a system to maintain the structure and function when confronted with shocks and change;
(2) adaptability, associated to the collective capacity of people to learn and adapt to the change
in conditions, aiming to achieve a desired status; (3) transformability, the capacity of people to
innovate and transform in crisis periods, aiming to create a new socioecological system when
the social and economic conditions become the existing system unbearable. This last aspect
refers, for example, to the capacity of transforming the socioeconomic context of crisis in an
opportunity to change and promote local economy.
The presented case study, based in the valorisation of endogenous products and local
population, supported on an endogenous and exogenous knowledge (know-how), had the skill
and capacity to learn, adapt and innovate, contributing to the valorisation of this territory and,
thus, stimulating its capacity of resilience. It is, unarguably, an example of local entrepreneurship,
where traditional products originated new productive combinations with refinement, elegance
and wisdom.
However, if on one hand Casa das Penhas Douradas hotel and the Burel Factory constitute
an element of increment of this territory’s resilience, from a socioeconomic perspective; on the
other hand its dynamics is insufficient to subvert the regressive development trajectories that
characterize the Manteigas municipality since several decades. At the level of human and social
capital, the focus of the study and one of the main resilience elements, despite the efforts with
expressive results in the requalification of human resources and social innovation, the company,
on its own, is not a factor of fixation and demographic reconversion. Its main relevance arises at
the level of employment: although only employing 40 workers, at a local level that contingent
becomes an expressive number, mainly when realizing its inexistence could imply unemployment
for that group of individuals. In fact, the company arises as an innovative and employing agent.
Nevertheless, the non-convergence of other local businessmen in these entrepreneurial logics
and innovation difficult large impacts in the local development trajectories. At the same time
it is realized that it becomes a crisis impact minimizing agent (unemployment), given the
population concerned, for its characteristics would tend to maintain in the municipality, despite
the potential situations of prolonged unemployment.
In this sense, other projects/businesses that aim to use and maximize this region’s endogenous
resources, able to trigger economic growth, aiming to retain the actors and increase the
employment rate will be a cornerstone in the change of regressive trajectories and in boosting
local development in these low density territories. Nevertheless, the multifunctionality and
diversity here evoked has, still, not very positive reflections for there is no solid strategy that lifts
endogenous products. The same happens at the level of territorial marketing strategies. There
is a resistance of several projects that try to propel the mountain and make it a destination, but
they are so much isolated that, even disseminated by media, they end up by having a residual
expression in structural terms.

Innovation for Resilience

Introduction
The progressive growth of the tertiary sector, since the 1950s, was the result of a great technological development that increased mechanization and automation in industrial production.
This, not only liberated manpower, but led to important changes in management culture. In the
late 1990s, in Western countries, the tertiary sector largely overtook other sectors of the economy.
The technological development that occurred in this period triggered several changes in
society and the economy. One of these changes concerned the new ways of processing and
handling large volumes of information that became exponentially greater than those of former
times. Information and knowledge assumed a central role in the economy, in particular in
relation to capital, raw materials and even labor.
Daniel Bell (1973), describing what he called the “post-industrial society,” refers to the
transition from a commodities production-based economy toward an economy where services
are increasingly important. In this scenario, knowledge and information become the catalysts of
innovation and social change and form the array of ideas that inspire the whole of society. Labor
and capital tend to be supplanted by information and knowledge, which become the central
variables of the economy (Kovács, 2002) and the political processes for their control become
increasingly evident. Expressions like “information society” and “information and knowledge
society” are increasingly popular (Freire, 2001).
As Peter Druker puts it, “in this society, knowledge is the primary resource for individuals
and for the economy as a whole” (Drucker, 1996, p. 78). That is why he also calls this knowledge
society a “society of organizations.” The purpose and function of each organization, whether
corporate or not, lies in the integration of expertise in its operations (Drucker, 1996).
Knowledge management emerged, thus, within the framework of scientific thought on
organizational management, from the necessity of using and combining multiple sources and
types of organizational knowledge in order to promote the development of specific skills or
innovative capabilities that could give rise to new products, new processes and to leadership of
the markets (Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1997).
Nowadays, rationalization of the use of resources and the improvement of service efficiency
puts an enormous pressure on all organizations, either public or private, not excepting, of
course, tourism organizations such as travel agencies or hotels. These frequently face significant
challenges for modernization and streamlining of the services they provide. The creation of
125

appropriate mechanisms that allow them to achieve their goals requires not only the improvement
of work processes, but the dedicated management of people and their knowledge.

Knowledge Management in the Hospitality Industry
Tourism is one of the most significant features of contemporary global society; a phenomenon
that directly or indirectly affects a significant part of the world’s population (Vieira, 1997).
Tourism is one of the economic activities with a higher propensity for growth and expansion.
It has impacts that range from the social, cultural, economic, and environmental levels to the
organizational level (Melo, 2005).
Knowledge management in the tourism sector, particularly in the hotel industry, is of critical
importance due to the fact that the main features of the services they provide are intangibility,
perishability and heterogeneity. Hotel services are characterized by their intangibility because,
after their use, the customer only retains his own perception and/or satisfaction. Hotel services
are also characterized by the simultaneity of production and consumption, as the service occurs
when it is used by the customers, often produced in their very presence. This requires a great
accuracy and constant attention to the quality of the service provided. The hospitality industry is
also characterized by the great heterogeneity of the services offered. Hotels systematically seek
to meet the needs and desires of their customers, constantly offering new products and services.
Another feature is the impossibility of storing the product: if, on a given night, a room is not
occupied, this implies that the income from its occupation has not been realized (Costa, 2008).
In addition, as Eiglier (1991, cited by Costa, 2008) puts it, in the hospitality industry, the
human and technical qualities of the personal are an integral part of the services provided, the
physical characteristics of the hotel being only a part of the whole system that it represents.
Zaei (2014) argues that the work in tourism and hotel management greatly depends on how the
workers use their knowledge in order to provide the best possible experience for customers. For
this reason, it is of critical importance that tourism organizations in general and the hospitality
industry in particular develop a knowledge management approach that enables them to retain
highly skilled staff and keep customers satisfied.
However, the hospitality industry has lagged behind in relation to knowledge management
practices already implemented in other sectors. Hallin and Marnburg (2008), quoting researchers in the field of tourism, pointed out the main reasons that explain the scarcity of research
and practice of knowledge management in tourism and hospitality organizations. According
to these researchers: i) in the literature, the concepts of knowledge management are mainly
developed from a multinational perspective (for example, Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995) and do not
take into account many aspects of tourism services and don’t have an inter-organizational perspective (Grizelj, 2003); ii) tourism researchers and knowledge management researchers must
change their traditional focus from studying organizations individually and begin to integrate
different organizations in their studies (Cooper 2006); iii) in relation to tourism, knowledge
management needs to incorporate inter-organizational issues such as knowledge stocks and
flows (Davidson & Voss 2002); iv) the frequent lack of application of scientific knowledge in
tourism organizations’ management prevents debate on the virtues of knowledge management
Innovation for Resilience

(Grizelj, 2003); v) the published research on knowledge management in tourism and hospitality
organizations is frequently too descriptive, often inconclusive and very limited (Ruhanen & Cooper, 2004). In addition, according to Ruhanen and Cooper, the tourism sector is dominated by
small- and medium-sized enterprises which are traditionally averse to scientific research. As a
result, research in the area has hardly addressed the issue of knowledge management (Ruhanen
& Cooper, 2004).
According to Bouncken, the quality of the service in a hotel depends heavily on its ability to
acquire, develop, collect and distribute knowledge (Bouncken, 2002). Research into knowledge
management in the hospitality industry therefore could enable these organizations to adopt
knowledge management processes in their day-to-day activities and increase their capacity for
organizational learning (Zaei, 2014).

Emergence and Conceptualization of Knowledge Management
The emergence of knowledge management
The subject of knowledge management is relatively recent. Karl Wiig is attributed as the
creator of the term in 19861 (Liebowitz & Beckman, 1998). During the 1990’s, some companies
such as Xerox, British Petroleum, and World Bank as well as some consulting firms such as Arthur
Andersen, Ernest & Young, KPMG and PriceWaterhouseCoopers implemented knowledge
management practices. The consultants working for these companies reported and published
their first experiences in this period. Thomas Davenport, for instance, revealed his experiences in
various companies, such as Microsoft, HP, IBM, Ernest & Young, and Teltech (Stollenwerk, 1999).
Nonaka, in 1991, published one of the first scientific papers on knowledge management in the
Harvard Business Review. In 1993, Karl Wiig published one of the first books on the subject,
entitled Knowledge Management Foundations. In 1994 the first conference on knowledge
management took place (Knowledge Management Network). Two years later, Nonaka and
Takeuchi published the book The Knowledge Creating Company: How Japanese Companies
Create the Dynamics of Innovation, a pioneer study on the creation and use of knowledge in
Japanese companies (Davenport & Prusak, 1998). In 1995, Dorothy Leornard-Barton published
her book Wellsprings of Knowledge, where she explains in detail the role of knowledge in
industrial enterprises (Davenport & Prusak, 1998). In this time, many books focusing on this
subject appeared. Companies such as Dow Chemical and Skandia, consultants McKinsey, Ernst
& Young, and IBM Consulting appointed supervisors for knowledge resources, designating them
knowledge managers or directors of intellectual capital (Davenport & Prusak, 1998).
According to Leonor Cardoso (2003) it is possible to distinguish three theoretical orientations
on the knowledge management approach. First, there is the contribution of Nonaka who,
starting from the Japanese organizational context, emphasizes the knowledge creation
processes as well as the distinction between tacit and explicit knowledge (Nonaka, 1991, 1994;
Karl Wiig was the first author who used the term “knowledge management” at a conference of the International Labor
Organization (ILO), in Switzerland.

1

127

Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1997; Nonaka, Toyama, & Konno, 2000; Nonaka, Toyama, & Nagata, 2000).
The second has earned more attention from European authors and focused the evaluation of
the knowledge resources (Kaplan & Norton, 1992, 1997; Edvinsson & Malone, 1997; Stewart,
1997; Sveiby, 1997). The third theoretical approach focuses on the role of technology as a tool
to support the processes of the creation and management of knowledge. This perspective tries
to understand how organizations extract, structure, encode, store, retrieve, and apply individual,
group and organizational knowledge. In this approach, the contributions of American authors
(such as Davenport & Prusak, 1998) are very relevant since they emphasized the way technology
platforms may stimulate and optimize interactive management (Cardoso, 2003).
To McElroy, the “first generation of knowledge management” was based on the assumption
that organizations hold valuable knowledge, the management of which is strongly supported
by technology, and focuses primarily on its capture, encoding, and sharing. The “second
generation” assumes that, before the capture, encoding, and sharing, knowledge has to be
created, so knowledge management focuses on what people need to create new knowledge,
without neglecting, of course, the use of technology (McElroy, 1999, 2003). This vison is close
to Nonaka’s, for whom knowledge management relates to the organization’s ability to create,
disseminate and incorporate new knowledge in their processes, products, and services. This
creative ability depends on the action of individuals and groups (Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1997).

•	 the external structure, which includes relationships with customers and suppliers, with
the trademarks, the image and reputation of the organization itself and also involves
sales activities, public relations, marketing, etc. (Sveiby, 1998, pp. 11–12).
Therefore, knowledge management is the “process by which the organization generates
wealth, from its knowledge or intellectual capital” (Bukowitz & Williams, 2002, p. 17). This
wealth results from the use of knowledge in order to create more efficient and consistent
processes that have positive impacts on the financial results, in the creation of value to the client,
and in the innovation and promotion of exclusive market offers. It is expected from knowledge
management, the development and application of the intellectual capital (tacit, explicit, and
embodied knowledge) in order to help the organization to achieve its goals, would these be
the quality of its services and products or its long-term profitability and viability (Wiig, 2004).
According to Terra (2003), all organizations manage their knowledge somehow, because
human work is not conceivable without the use of intelligence. Work processes always reuse
knowledge to produce and to correspond to the clients’ demands. Knowledge management has
a universal character, since it occurs in organizations belonging to a diversity of sectors: from
traditional to cutting-edge areas, from primary sector organizations to industries or services
(Terra, 2001). In fact, this author prefers to speak about knowledge management initiatives
rather than about a knowledge management project. In his own words,

Conceptualization of knowledge management

In the context of the organizational theories, knowledge management is seen as a process that
promotes the development, innovation, and strengthening of competitiveness in organizations.
From this perspective, knowledge management consists basically in the management of the
context where knowledge is created (Nonaka & Konno, 1998).
To Wiig (1997a, 1997b, 2004), knowledge management is the systematic, explicit, and
deliberate management of knowledge and the promotion of its creation, construction, renovation,
and application in order to maximize the effectiveness of the organization’s knowledge.
According to Liebowitz (2001), knowledge management consists in the process of enhancing
the intangible assets of an organization. It is about taking advantage of the internal and external
knowledge about customers and stakeholders, that is, the best way to share knowledge in order
to create value and add benefits to the organization (Liebowitz, 2001).
Karl Sveiby (1998) specifies that knowledge management is the ability to create value from
the intangible assets of an organization, these being:
•	 the competence of the employees, which Comprises their capacity of action in different
situations in order to create tangible and intangible assets;
•	 the internal structure, which consists in the flow of knowledge within the organization
(patents, concepts, information systems, and administrative models created by the
employees or purchased externally); and

lating the formation of communities of practice, patents, encouraging the sharing of know­ledge,
etc. is not about knowledge management? (Terra, 2003, p. 168).

With this line of thought Zheng, Yang, and Mclean (2010) argue that knowledge management
consists in the efforts made in order to facilitate the activities of acquisition, creation, storage,
sharing, dissemination, development, and implementation of knowledge by individuals and
groups. Creation of knowledge consists in both its acquisition by the organization through
external sources, and in the internal processes of creation. The sharing of knowledge, also
referred to as its “transfer” or “diffusion”, refers to the process by which knowledge is transferred
from one individual to another, from individuals to groups, or between groups. The use of
knowledge, also called application or implementation, refers to its use in concrete everyday
organizational life (Zheng et al., 2010).
For Cardoso, knowledge management is “the creation and development of internal
organizational conditions that catalyze all processes related to knowledge (its creation/acquisition,
sharing/dissemination, storage, retrieval, use, etc.) in order to achieve the objectives of the
organization” (Cardoso, 2003, p. 186). It consists in a set of everyday activities concerning the
development of organizational conditions that enhance all the processes related to knowledge
as an essential resource for the achievement of the objectives of a given organization (Cardoso,
2003, p. 199).

The use of Knowledge as a Dimension of Knowledge Management
The primary purpose of knowledge management is the use of knowledge for the benefit of
the efficiency of the organization (Cabrita, 2009). To apply organizational knowledge means
to mobilize it in decision-making, in task accomplishment, in problem-solving, in the search for
new ideas, and in learning (Liebowitz & Beckman, 1998).
At this stage the creative and innovative use of knowledge plays a critical role in the effective
creation of value for the customer or user. Innovation thus becomes the heart of the matter,
revealing itself in the creation of alternative solutions. Regardless of the reasons that create it,
innovation is always an adaptive behavior that allows the organizations to maintain or improve
their performance (Damanpour, Walker, & Avellaneda, 2009).
In the literature, there are fundamentally three major classifications of innovation (Camisón,
Lapiedra, Segarra, & Boronat, 2003). The first emphasizes the technical or technological
innovation and the organizational or administrative innovation (Daft, 1978; Damanpour,
Fariborz, & Evan, 1984; Camisón & Monfort-Mir, 2012). Technological innovation is obviously
the result of the introduction of new technologies in products or processes (Damanpour & Evan,
1984). Normally this kind of innovation is associated with change of the “technological core” or
the “technical system” of the organization. Technological innovations are directly related to the
main activity of the organization, and their introduction will eventually produce changes in the
products, processes, operating systems, and physical capital of production (Camisón-Zornoza
& Monfort-Mir, 2009; Camisón & Monfort-Mir, 2012). Organizational innovation consists in the
introduction of novelties in the management methods, in the ways of organizing work, or in the
business model (Julián, 2009). This type of innovation normally represents a new approach in
the scope of the “administrative core” or in the “social system” of the organization. It consists
in the implementation of new practices in human resource management, in the structure and
organization of work and in the relation with the external environment, namely with customers,
markets, suppliers, and competitors (Damanpour & Evan, 1984; Camisón & Monfort-Mir, 2012).
Organizational innovation is then directly linked to the organization’s management and indirectly
to its basic activities (Damanpour et al., 2009; Camisón-Zornoza & Monfort-Mir, 2009; Camisón
& Monfort-Mir, 2012). The organization’s performance depends on a balanced adoption of the
two types of innovation (Julián, 2009).
The second classification, technological innovation, distinguishes product innovation from
process innovation (Tidd, Bessant, & Pavitt, 2003; Hameed, Counsell, & Swift, 2012). Product
innovation corresponds to the introduction of new products and services. In turn, process
innovation corresponds to the introduction of new elements in the sphere of tasks, decisionmaking, and information systems, or at the level of production or provision of services. Frequently,
process innovation is less visible than product innovation, but sometimes the distinction between
them is very tenuous. Services constitute a paradigmatic example of how an innovation can be
at the process level and at the product level at the same time. For instance, a new vacation
package constitutes a change in the product and in the process (Tidd et al., 2003).
The third innovation classification is split into incremental innovation and radical innovation
(Camisón et al., 2003; Tidd et al., 2003). Radical innovation causes fundamental changes in the
dominant practices and in the knowledge available in a given organization or industry (Camisón
Innovation for Resilience

et al., 2003; Silva, 2004), it changes the way its members think and act (Tidd et al., 2003).
Incremental innovation, by contrast, consists in gradual changes in the usual practices (Camisón
et al., 2003). Jansen, Van Den Bosch, and Volberda (2006) refer to these two types of innovation
using the terms exploratory innovation and exploitative innovation, respectively.
The capacity to innovate of a given organization depends on its dynamic capacity3 which is
formed by the values held by its members, their know-how, tacit knowledge, and their ability to
apply new knowledge in the development of new products and processes (Julián, 2009, p. 157).
Notwithstanding, there are several obstacles to the use of the new knowledge and
innovative procedures, namely mistrust regarding the source of the new knowledge, pride and
stubbornness, lack of time, lack of opportunity, and the fear of taking risks. People tend to resist
any changes that require dropping any of their previous skills because they usually believe that
those skills identify them professionally, assuring them of their well-being at work.
Organizations may provide the means to enhance creative thinking, but more important
than this is to promote an environment in which creativity, experimentation and openness to
new ideas are stimulated (Bukowitz & Williams, 2002).
Decision-making has changed: it is no longer the exclusive domain of senior executives to become a distributed domain by line managers. However, sometimes, the flow of information is not
distributed equally. For the use of knowledge to be effective it is important to think of information
as a resource that flows freely throughout the organization (Bukowitz & Williams, 2002).
Freedom to act with creativity opens up the possibility for the invention of new solutions that
provide new and better results. “When people are able to think differently the understanding
of how the organization creates value becomes multifaceted instead of restricted” (Bukowitz &
Williams, 2002, p. 127). It is clear that an increase in participation can lead to an increase in “noise.”
Confusion increases, requiring further efforts in the selection of contributions. However, the
potential emergence of new and good ideas also increases. In this process of fostering creativity
it is essential to create space and to set a time for experimentation (Terra, 2001) in order to allow
the creative ideas to flourish without disturbing the functioning of the organization. There are
organizations that establish formal processes to encourage suggestions for improvements, and
standardized processes for feedback about the results of creative ideas, innovative actions, and
the sharing of knowledge, through public recognition or even the award of prizes.
In these processes, the application of knowledge may result in the identification of new
ways to exploit it, leading to a new cycle of creation of knowledge (Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1997).
With this line of thought, Serrano and Fialho (2003) argue that organizations have as their
primary function the organization of existing knowledge, making it applicable, and the creation
of new knowledge, with the objective of enhancing their performance. In this way, success
depends on the transformation of existing knowledge in the field of ideas, and employment of
knowledge through actions (Serrano & Fialho, 2003).

3
Dynamic capacities are understood as the organizational capacity to effectively integrate, adapt, renovate, reconfigure,
and transform its assets as well as its external resources (Teece, Pisano, & Shuen, 1997; Teece, 2007), in order to respond
to changing situations. Innovative capacity means the capacity to integrate and make decisions about technological,
cultural, and organizational features that encourage learning, creation, and application of knowledge (Camisón-Zornoza
& Monfort-Mir, 2009).

Research Methodology
The second step of the study involved gauging the opinions of the real users of the
organizational knowledge, i.e., the staff that truly implement the management policies through
their daily practices. Considering the size of the universe, we opted for an extensive approach
and therefore a quantitative perspective. Through a random sample, we intended to identify the
opinions, attitudes, and practices of staff in relation to organizational knowledge.
Through lists of staff provided by the hotels, a random sample stratified by professional
category and by area of service was defined for each group (with a sampling error of 3%),
as presented in Table 2. Thus, the elements of the population have been organized by strata
according to the main activity areas of the hotels, each of these strata representing a random
sample proportional to the population (Marconi & Lakatos, 1999).
Table 3 – Stratified sampling of the study
Sample strata
Group A

In the research, the main results of which are presented in this chapter, we opted for a
multiple case-study approach since we intended to thoroughly understand the processes of
knowledge management in hospitality organizations. Therefore, it was considered important
to study various cases of hotel chains – through the use of the “literal replication” criterion
(Yin, 2005) – with the purpose of making comparisons that would allow a more in-depth
understanding of the reality of this type of organization. Thus, each case study corresponds
to a hotel group, which in turn is composed of several sub-units: the hotels where data was
collected. The research presented may thus be considered as an embedded multiple case-study
of descriptive character.
For reasons of anonymity and confidentiality, the studied hotel groups will be designated as
follows: Group A (nine hotels), Group B (six hotels) and Group C (one hotel). Groups A and B are
two of the main hotel chains operating in Portugal, and Group C is a multinational company in
the hospitality sector and one of the most prestigious international hotel chains.

Group C

When studying the dynamics of complex organizations and, simultaneously, the practices
of the people who compose them, the quantity and diversity of data to be analyzed is often
too big. Bearing this in mind, we decided to use a two-step methodology comprising two main
techniques of data collection: semi-structured interviews and a survey.
In the first step, the interviewees were selected on the basis on their position, experience,
and knowledge about the industry. The interviews were essentially addressed to directors with
the purpose of understanding in depth the policies and practices of knowledge management in
the hotels in which they worked. In Group A, seven interviews were conducted with five general
directors of hotels (designated by DH-A1, DH-A2, DH-A3, DH-A4, and DH-A5), the director of
human resources (DHR-Group A) and the director of informatics for the Algarve (DIA-Group
A). In Group B, six interviews were conducted: three directors of hotels (designated by DH-B1;

Analysis and interpretation of data
Data interpretation and analysis is one of the most complex stages of any research process
since it is a crucial stage in the reconstruction of the meaning of the information collected. Given
the extent and diversity of the collected data, it is important to keep in mind what Miles and
Huberman (1994) have called the “data analysis overall strategy,” which provides the general
framework of data analysis. This investigation sought to keep a careful articulation between
data collection techniques and analysis.
Data collected through the interviews was recorded, organized, and then thematically
analyzed through qualitative data analysis software NVivo 9. Data obtained through the
survey was analyzed using the computer package SPSS 21. The responses were first coded and
entered into the computer program, and then statistically analyzed. Then, the combination and
comparison of the different types of gathered information was carried out.

The use of Knowledge in Hospitality
The case of Group A
After locating and obtaining knowledge, the organization faces the challenge of using it
effectively in work situations. Creative use of knowledge is of great importance for the emergence
of alternative and more efficient solutions; innovation is a central issue in organizational life.
When asked if the staff of the hotel group is encouraged to innovate, the respondents
emphasized the ongoing process of repositioning the brand that began in 2008. Back then,
this group created a new concept based on tourist experiences, which became its trademark.
This concept is based on the offer made to the clients of a diversity of experiences, both within
and outside its hotels. The implementation of this change has triggered a series of innovation
processes in terms of products and services. According to the respondents, this gave place to an
environment in which workers were constantly challenged to innovate and find new solutions.
We are known by the market for having, in the past four years, repositioned the brand, which was
already old and spent. So, we made an update to our brand an aggiornamento and that led to
innovation processes. … At this stage, our group won this year’s Portugal Tourism award for the
best service, through a component of innovation that we put into practice. It was the experiences
thing. …. “Look, come on and try other things, have new experiences!” That attitude led the
hotels of the group to create their own experiences. It led, for instance, to the establishment of a
partnership with the company A Vida é Bela for the distribution and selling of the experiences we

The interviewees emphasized the importance of the meeting of the Committees5 where
new ideas are transformed into new products and new services. As the director of human
resources explains,
[The Committees] are much related to the implementation of many of the products that resulted
from innovation. Because what these forums do is to operationalize the concepts (DHR-Group A).

The director of the hotel (A4) stated that, in his hotel, the Safety & Hygiene Committee
function has a kind of “nursery,” innovating and experimenting in his area. He expects this
methodology to expand toward other areas of the hotel.
Taking into account that several authors refer to the stimuli of creativity as one of the ways to
promote the use of knowledge in organizations, our interviewees were asked about the incentive
to be creative in their hotels, namely, if there are occasions when people can communicate their
ideas and submit their suggestions and if these are effectively implemented and acknowledged.
At the time of the fieldwork, Group A had no formal program to collect suggestions, yet there
are certain formal occasions when the staff can present their suggestions: during committee
meetings and other meetings, through questionnaires addressed to staff, through a suggestion
box and during meals with the director. Informal situations were also mentioned as privileged
ways of exchanging ideas.
According to the general director of hotel A5, the presentation of suggestions varies from
hotel to hotel but, usually, there are regular meetings at all levels of the hierarchy, from general
meetings to department meetings, and meetings between the directors of the departments and
their teams, etc. and in all of them, employees are given the opportunity to submit suggestions.
In the daily life there are several leadership meetings in each of the departments [during which occur]
the exchange of opinions and in which people communicate freely. Every chance of improvement
suggested, no matter by who, is taken into consideration (DH-A5 Group A).

Daily briefings with the headmen of the various operational areas, which allow the exchange
of suggestions and good practice, were also mentioned by the director. The annual staff survey,
to collect opinions on issues such as working conditions and remuneration, also includes space for
collecting improvement suggestions. During the meetings of the Committee of Accommodation,
F&B and Purchasing6 there is always an item on the agenda dedicated to innovation and creativity
and to the evaluation of suggestions. There are also some initiatives that are specific to each
hotel. For example, the General Director of Hotel A4 says that in his hotel there are several ways
to interact with the staff. The staff is represented on the Committee on Safety, Hygiene, and
Working that has formal meetings with management on a monthly basis.

developed. It led to online selling, etc., etc. (DH-A4 Group A).
In our group [to innovate] is not only possible, but is stimulated. The constant challenge is that we
have to innovate. We have to find new solutions and to be always changing things. This constantly
challenges us and,

at certain times, leads to a great disorganization, but after, it has very positive

effects. It gives us important opportunities for development and growth (DHR-Group A).

to realize that the things are moving and that there is something concrete being done with their
suggestions (DH-A4 Group A).

In the staff restaurant of hotel A2, there is a suggestion box where staff leave ideas that are
later evaluated and eventually implemented. In the same hotel, there are specific occasions where
the representatives of each section present their colleagues’ improvement ideas to the director.
Each section chooses an employee to have lunch or breakfast with me. For half an hour, this
employee can talk with me, ask me questions, present ideas, his or other’s …. It’s usually a section

In this group of hotels, new ideas can also be informally presented. According to the results
of the questionnaire addressed to the staff, this seems to be the main form of communicating
improvement ideas and suggestions. The majority of the staff survey (80%) said that, when they
have an idea or suggestion, they would talk to their immediate superior; 14.6% of respondents
reported they would rather talk to the colleagues who represent them at the meetings. It should be
noted that only about 5% indicated they chose not to share their improvement ideas with anyone.
According to the majority of the survey respondents, there is a clear concern of the
management in implementing the suggestions proposed by the workers after a prior assessment.
Usually, when the suggestions concern the hotel group as a whole, they are approved by the
Board of General Directors.

The use of acquired knowledge occurs in the execution of tasks, in decision-making and, of
course, in solving problems (Liebowitz & Beckman, 1998). In this sense, workers were asked
about what they would do when faced with a problem in the course of their duties. Looking
at the data from the questionnaire (Figure 2) we can see that the majority (85%) said that they
would speak to their immediate superior, 41% try to understand the general context in which
the problem occurs, 28% stated that they would try to find a solution, while 20% would consult
with colleagues. The data reveals that that everyday problem resolution still tends to be left to
the upper levels of the hierarchy.

This Board stays below the Executive Management and includes the Regional Directors, the Finance
Director, The Sales & Marketing Director, The Human Resources Director, the Quality Director and

concerning all the hotels are made (DH-A5 Group A).

Although Group A does not have a formal reward practice for the implemented ideas, the
General Director of hotel A5 considers that, in one way or another, the staff are ultimately
rewarded.
In this group, there is some concern to publicly recognize the authors of new ideas – namely
through the dissemination of these ideas and through the association of the authors’ names
and their ideas – although this concern is not always recognized by the staff. In what concerns
the implementation of innovative ideas and their recognition, the staff opinions diverge. On the
one hand, approximately 50% considered that the ideas suggested by the staff are effectively
implemented and that the author is made known. On the other hand, the remaining 50% of
people thought exactly the opposite (Figure 1). It should be noted that 55% of the respondents
reported that they were not aware how contributors were recognized for the presentation of an
innovative idea. The discrepancy of opinions on these issues shows that the enterprise’s policies
regarding creativity and its recognition are still not sufficiently clear to the staff.

When asked about the organizational learning stimulus, three of the interviewees belonging
to Group A considered that learning is effectively stimulated. According to the director of human
resources, the organization’s members are very sensitive to and aware of the need to constantly
update and, therefore, learn. The general director of hotel A3 gave concrete examples of Group
A’s learning incentives:
For instance, the head of reception asked for a meeting room for tomorrow because his team has
some new elements and he wants to meet with them to discuss some of the section’s issues and

The case of Group B
In Group B, innovation results fundamentally from experimentation with new procedures
coming both from inside and outside the group. On the one hand, innovation comes from
experimentation with initiative which have proved successful in several of the group’s hotels.
On the other hand, unsuccessful experiences in hotels not belonging to the group are carefully
observed. Sometimes those “bad ideas” are rethought and eventually implemented in the group.
Group B thus innovates from their own experimentation and also learns from others’ failures.

The general director of hotel A1 considers recognition as a fundamental issue in encouraging
people to do their best: “the more knowledge they bring to the company, the more they are
recognized” (DH-A1 Group A). According to the interviewees, the stimulus for learning is made
through the promotion of participation in learning processes, and through the recognition of
the workers. In the opinion of the workers themselves, 82% agree that they are encouraged to
learn. A less significant majority (65%) agree that mistakes are seen by the organization as part
of the learning process, however, only 45% of them agree that the organization encourages
employee participation in decision-making. It should also be noted that a significant number
(35%) is undecided on this issue, as illustrated in Figure 3.

With regard to the incentives for creativity, we tried to find out how these organizations
stimulate and disseminate the ideas of their employees and how they recognize and implement
their suggestions. At the time of the fieldwork, Group B didn’t have any formal program for
collecting suggestions. However, there are opportunities during which workers can submit their
suggestions. These include the weekly and monthly leadership meetings, the annual general
meeting, as well as in periodic surveys about the social climate of the hotel and about hygiene
and safety at work. Workers can also convey their suggestions directly to the director of the
hotel either in an informal way or when they are asked for new ideas in the context of certain
specific initiatives.

The survey data indicates that the workers tend to transmit their improvement suggestions
essentially to their superiors. The majority (89%) state that they speak to the superior when they
have a new idea or suggestion, and only 10% say they would rather speak to colleagues who
represent them in the meetings to communicate their ideas.
The respondents stress that in this organization implementing staff suggestions following a
preliminary evaluation is felt to be important. However, recognition of these ideas consists of a
mere thank you to the author and its dissemination on the intranet.
I shouldn’t be telling you this but unfortunately, if a person submits a good idea, the
acknowledgement is only: “Good idea, thank you!” (DH-B5 Group B).

With regard to the implementation of innovative ideas and their recognition, 57% of the
respondents reported that the ideas suggested by the workers are not implemented by the
organization. A similar percentage (56%), believed that, even when ideas are implemented, no
one gets to know who suggested them. It should be noted that 66% of respondents do not
know how innovative ideas should be recognized, as shown in Figure 4.

When asked about the stimulus for learning, three of the interviewees considered that –
as in Group A – learning is effectively stimulated in Group B. According to the director of
human resources, learning is implicit in the activity, since knowledge is the key to success
in the hospitality industry. The director of hotel B5 stated that learning is embedded in the
organizational culture.

I think learning is implicit in the activity itself, in what is the main activity of the group. ... The
hospitality industry is an activity within which knowledge is critical to the success. Now, when I say
knowledge I don’t mean only technical knowledge but also what seems more important: behavioral

In this group too there is neither an explicit policy to encourage creativity nor a formalized
program to collect suggestions, to implement them and to recognize their authors. However, as
has already been mentioned, the respondents referred to certain situations during which workers
can effectively present their innovative ideas: the weekly and monthly leadership meetings, the
annual general meeting and the periodic surveys addressed to the workers. Moreover, workers
are encouraged to share their suggestions with the director of the hotel as well as with their
superiors, both informally and when they are challenged to. However, not all opportunities to
contribute mentioned by the interviewees are effectively used by the workers. Most of them,
when they have an idea or suggestion speak to their superior, which reveals that the managers
have a key role. However, the majority of the respondents believed that few of the suggestions
made are actually implemented and, if they are, their author remains unacknowledged. This
reveals that in Group B hotels there is no explicit policy to encourage creativity and to stimulate
and reward the generation of new ideas.
With regard to the use of knowledge in everyday tasks, workers were asked what they
usually do when they face a problem. The data presented in Figure 5 shows that the majority
(85%) of the respondents stated that they speak to their superiors, 35% would try to understand
the general context in which the problem occurs 32% said they would come up with a solution
and 22% said they consult with colleagues. These data show clearly that, at the level of problem
resolution, there is a strong dependence on the formal hierarchy.

knowledge. Now, within our business’s logic: “from people to people,” this business won’t survive
if people don’t know the culture of the organization, if they don’t know the activity, if they don’t
know very simple issues such as the interpersonal relationships. That knowledge management is
done on a daily basis. It must be done (DHR-Group B).

Data from the survey shows that the stimulus for using knowledge is recognized by the
majority of the workers from Group B: 73% of the respondents agree or totally agree with
the statement “In the hotel people are encouraged to learn,” and 71% of respondents agree
or totally agree that mistakes are seen as part of the learning process, as shown in Figure 6.
However, in relation to the participation of employees in the processes of decision-making,
53.8% of the respondents indicated that they totally disagree, disagree or were undecided. The
data reveals that respondents do not really feel encouraged to participate in decision-making.

According to the survey, this actually seems to be the main method of communicating
ideas and suggestions for improvement. The majority of the surveyed employees (88%) stated
that when they have an idea or suggestion they speak to their superior, and only 9% of the
respondents said they would speak to the colleagues who represent them at meetings. It
should be noted that only 2% indicated they would not usually tell anyone about their ideas or
suggestions for improvement of work processes or services provided by the hotel.
The general manager of hotel C and the director of human resources were unanimous in
saying that the ideas of the employees, when they are considered good and achievable, are
implemented. The recognition and reward for such ideas is undertaken through the process of
the worker’s assessment as an indicator of their proactivity.

The case of Group C
In what concerns innovation in Group C, the responsible for the information systems refers
that this group always tries to innovate, namely in the technology sector, as they want to be at the
forefront of the international market. These features have become the very essence of the group.
We’re always trying to develop ourselves. If you look at the history of the group, you’ll note that

person who wants to improve. And of course, all these things count in the evaluation (DHR-Group C).

Analyzing the opinion of the respondents of the survey in respect to the practices that reflect
the development of new ideas and, therefore, encourage creativity, 83% considered that the
ideas suggested by the workers are implemented. In the opinion of 78% of the respondents,
when ideas and suggestions are implemented the author is known and 77% of respondents
revealed that they know how they will be recognized if they submit an innovative idea (Figure 7).

Group C has always been a world leader in the implementation of new technologies. Let’s see

In relation to the incentives for creativity, we sought to understand if there’s scope for
people to disseminate their ideas and submit suggestions, and to ascertain whether these are
implemented and recognized. Monthly departmental meetings are referred to as the occasions
where workers can submit their ideas. In addition, workers can also communicate their ideas
to their heads of department or use the suggestion box, although, according to the director of
human resources, this is not often used.

Firstly, there is a lot of communication between the heads of departments and the employees.
Secondly, we have the monthly meetings, with the heads of department and the employees. During
these meetings, innovation is one of the issues. We are always asking: “Are there any ideas to
improve relationships with other departments? Are there any ideas to improve anything?” Then
they [the employees] speak and give ideas. We also have a suggestion box but it’s not widely used.
They prefer to speak (DHR-Group C).
Innovation for Resilience

Hotel C does not have a formalized program for collecting suggestions and ideas, however,
according to the director interviewed, workers can submit their ideas and suggestions to the
heads of departments during the monthly meetings, or deposit them in the suggestion box,
although the latter procedure is not very typical. According to the survey data, the majority of
employees believe that most of the suggestions are implemented and valued.

The workers were also asked how they react when faced with a problem in the course
of their daily tasks. It appears that, as in the previous groups, the vast majority (80%) would
speak to their superior, 42% move forward with a solution, 39% try to understand the general
context in which the problem occurs and only 14% consult with colleagues. Figure 8 reveals
that problem-solving relies on the management. However, there are a significant number of
respondents who are proactive and put forward solutions.

Conclusions
This investigation has allowed us to conclude that although the concept of knowledge
management itself is not completely internalized by the members of the studied hotels,
knowledge management practices are present in their managerial activities.
Innovation for Resilience

A careful comparison of the three cases leads to the conclusion that none of the hotel
groups have structured programs for collecting suggestions and implementation of new ideas,
nor formal structures specifically designed for the development of implemented ideas in order
to encourage creativity. In the absence of an integrated policy, formal and informal circums­
tances where workers can communicate their ideas and submit their suggestions for improvement are variable.
Although informality is mentioned by several authors as an important factor for the emergence of a creative environment, the lack of a clear policy to encourage creativity may result
in the loss of suggestions which could have a potentially positive impact on the economic performance of these hotels. However, the survey data indicates that in Group C the policy of
encouraging creativity is clearer than in the other groups. The data demonstrates that the main
method for communicating ideas and suggestions of employees is through their superiors. This
fact reveals the importance of the leadership for the creation of new knowledge, as sustained
by Nonaka and Takeuchi (1997). Middle management are in an intermediate position where they
can synthesize and integrate knowledge coming from frontline workers with knowledge coming
from top-level executives.
The groups studied encouraged the creative application of knowledge in the context of what
Tidd et al. (2003) designated as the “product innovation” which consists in the introduction
of new products and hotel services that, in turn, lead to innovation processes, namely, to the
introduction of new tasks, decision-making at the level of production of those products, and
the provision of these services.
The Accommodation and F&B Committees of Group A, and the Safety and Hygiene
Committee of hotel A4, assume great importance in the field of innovation, because this is
where new ideas are transformed into new products. In turn, Group C has a centralized research
team that creates new knowledge and operational innovation. However, these innovations
occur at the central level and not at the hotel level. In the Group B hotels, innovation results,
fundamentally, from inside experimentation, but also from the observation and implementation
of the experiences of other hotels that do not belong to the group.
The use of knowledge in everyday work also involves making decisions and solving problems.
However, in these organizations there is a great dependency on the formal hierarchy and a great
preponderance of intermediate-level leaders to achieve this.
Given the rapid socioeconomic and political transformations, tourism and hospitality
organizations face difficulties such as operating in highly uncertain contexts, the rapid change
in the preferences of the customers and, therefore, the shortening of the products’ and services’
life-cycles. Customer loyalty and customer satisfaction are the most important factors for the
success of a hotel chain. Tourism and hospitality workers have direct contact with the customers,
so it is especially important that these workers process the right knowledge about customer
preferences and how to provide the best service (Bouncken, 2002). Therefore, knowledge
management can be an effective organizational approach to help the hospitality industry to
deal with turbulent contexts. However, it is of the utmost importance that these organizations
undertake knowledge management as an integral part of their strategy, in order to integrate
and enhance the various actions, otherwise, these efforts may not have a great impact on eir
overall performance.

Innovation for Resilience

Introduction
Knowledge and innovation production processes have an increasing attention in the
academia, the business sector and in public decision due to the recognition of its importance to
economic growth, in particular, and the development of societies, in general.
Processes of creation, diffusion and application of knowledge are considered the driving
force of economic dynamics at different scales and recognized as a source of innovation.
In scientific literature innovation is considered a key factor of economic growth and
competitiveness of territories. Cities are characterized by high concentration and diversification
of economic activities and people, which provides prone environments to generation,
dissemination and accumulation of knowledge and innovation. They attract talent, knowledgeintensive investment and are friendly places to creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship.
The structure and organization of the economy of cities result from individual actions of
many economic agents (individuals, families, business, government institutions, diversified
organizations), as well as from the network of relationships established between them.
Entrepreneurship initiatives of private sector has been of particular attention to researchers
and policy makers due to the recognition that they are essential for the development and economic growth, job creation and innovation. The scientific literature explains entrepreneurship
as a product of local context and characteristics of individuals. The territories are endowed with
different infrastructures of knowledge, institutions and resources. Individuals are heterogeneous with regard to knowledge, skills, values and preferences that guide their motivations and
behaviors. Thus, the entrepreneurship process depends on the opportunities offered by territories and the capacity and motivation of individuals to identify, evaluate and exploit these
opportunities. In other words, for people with the same individual characteristics territorial
context can make a difference in the extent that can favor an entrepreneurial attitude or, on
the contrary, inhibit it (Boschma & Martin 2010; Bosma & Sternberg 2014). Urban areas are particularly privileged in what concern to the existence of favorable conditions for entrepreneurial
process. Characterized by a high population density and a strong flow of people (inhabitants,
workers, students, visitors), they facilitate the increase and diversification of demand and the
access to inputs needed for production of goods and services (financial capital, labor force, suppliers, among others) (García 2014).

As is characteristic of European cities, retail sector is linked to Oporto from its beginning,
being a key aspect in understanding the development of city in general and in particular of its
centre (Fernandes 1997).
It is our aim to analyze bottom-up initiatives of economic entrepreneurship in Oporto city
centre through the approach of urban agents related to retail sector. Our results are based in 24
semi-structured interviews, made during 2015, to entrepreneurs of different types and formats
of economic activity. Respondents were owners, managers or employees of fixed establishments
and responsible for management and organization of urban markets.
This work is structured this way: first its approached some important ideas about theory,
analytical models and public strategies in what concerns to economic development and
innovation; in a second point are presented the main challenges faced nowadays by cities and
the issues related to entrepreneurship and bottom-up initiatives for local economic development;
in the following point is explained the case study discussed in this paper; and finally, some
conclusions are systematized.

Economic development and innovation: theory, analytical models
and public strategies
Recognition of the importance of knowledge and innovation production processes for the
development of societies, in general, and for economic growth, in particular, is at the root of
growing attention given to them in the context of academic research, business sector and pu­blic
decision. With the advancement of economies and societies, knowledge matter even more and in
ways that are not always predictable or controllable. The well succeed performance of developed
and developing economies depends increasingly on knowledge (Carayannis & Campbell 2011).
Knowledge is considered the driving force of economic, social and technological dynamics
at different scales and recognized as a source of innovation (van Geenhuizen & Nijkamp 2012).
There is a broader body of scientific literature where it is argued that innovation is a key
factor of economic growth and competitiveness of territories (Carayannis & Grigoroudis 2014;
Dabic et al. 2011). Innovation is a phenomenon inherent to human development. The emergence
of innovations capable of changing people’s behavior, working methods and the labor market
characterize the history of mankind (Galindo & Méndez 2014). It has become increasingly
important to meet the societal challenges of our time. Ideas, creativity, skills and ability to solve
problems are considered driving forces of innovation (Saari et al. 2015).
Innovation is often linked to the creation of a sustainable market around the introduction
of new or improved products or processes. A broader interpretation refers innovation as an
idea, practice or material artifact adopted by individuals or organizations. It tends to change
perceptions and relationships at the organizational level. But in its wider context (socio-technical,
economic and political) can significantly impact, shape and evolve the way people live their lives,
how business are created, managed and how they perform, and how nations thrive or decline
(Carayannis & Campbell 2011).
The geography of innovation is complex and the capability to pass from knowledge to innova­­
tion and innovation to economic growth is different from region to region (Camagni & Capello
Innovation for Resilience

2013). The great development of the theoretical framework around innovation took place since
the 50s of twentieth century and was around 30 years after, in academia, with the development
of innovation systems studies, that the processes and dynamics of innovation were explained as a
result of networks of interaction between agents - companies, universities and laboratories, gover­
nment, schools and other intermediary institutions. It is consensual that the innovation process
is the transformation of knowledge into goods, services or processes and is the result of the acti­
vity of different agents and the network of relationships between them (Salavisa & Fontes 2012).
Networks facilitate the flows of information and knowledge, the access to resources, the
reduction of transaction costs, the influence of agents, the promotion of reputation and social
recognition or the enhancement of personal or group qualities. The social capital can be seen
as the sum of current and potential resources that a person or organization can access or
derive through network integration (Soetanto et al. 2012). In scientific literature have been
discussed explanatory models of these processes in an attempt to create analytical frameworks
that constitute a reference for the analysis and understanding of knowledge and innovation
production in different fields of knowledge or geographical areas. Models became more
complex over time, due to the consideration of multiple actors and factors involved. Some
authors argue in favor of co-existence and co-evolution of different analytical models in a given
innovation system of a given area (Carayannis & Campbell 2011).
Classic in terms of formulation, the linear model of innovation gives a simplistic view of the
production and use of knowledge. The emergence of more complex models, based not only
on the interactions between multiple agents as well on their territorialization, derived from the
growing need of intermediation generated as relations became more complex and multifaceted
(Alexander & Martin 2013). In summary, the linear model of innovation explains the production of
innovation through the succession of stages: the fundamental research of universities becomes
applied research of institutions related to the academy; in turn, applied research is adopted
and transformed into experimental development that is put on the market by companies. In
nonlinear models of innovation, basic research, applied research and experimental development
are developed in parallel, occurring interaction between the different actors involved throughout
the process (Carayannis & Campbell 2011). There are various approaches in terms of non-linear
innovation models (Carayannis & Campbell 2011).
In 1996, Loet Leydesdorff and Henry Etzkowitz presented the model of Triple Helix as an
analysis tool of the dynamics associated with knowledge-based economies and innovation
systems. In terms of formulation, the model can be seen by two different sides: as neoinstitutional model it reflects the relationships and exchanges among different institutions and
as neo-evolutionary model it translates the mechanisms of exchanges between three different
functions – creation of wealth, knowledge production and regulatory control (Leydesdorff
2012). Each of the propellers acts reflexively in response to the actions of the other two. The
knowledge-based economies and innovation systems evolve depending on the actions and
mutual adjustments. The university represents the role of knowledge creation and intellectual
capital and reflects the academic leadership; the industry is the creation of economic wealth
and reflects the business strategies, and government institutions represent normative control
function and regulation of the public sphere (Leydesdorff et al. 2006; Leydesdorff & Meyer

The model of the Triple Helix is considered today a classic perspective (Alexander & Martin 2013).
Based on the analytical model of Leydesdorff and Etzkowitz, Carayannis and Campbell
(2011) present two more comprehensive models to explain the advanced innovation systems.
Each model comprises the model(s) less comprehensive (Figure 1).

The Quadruple Helix model adds, to the three original propellers, civil society and the public,
shaped by cultural characteristics and the media. In this model, emphasis is given to the culture
of knowledge and knowledge of the culture and to the values of
​​ society and their lifestyles. The
sciences and the arts are placed in the same importance plan. The model refers to the structures
and processes of the glocal knowledge-based economy and society. It brings to the discussion
issues related to the democracy of knowledge. The Quintuple Helix model adds the ambience
of societies (social ecology) and economies as the driving force of progress in knowledge
production processes and innovation systems. The innovation ecosystem contextualizes
Quadruple and Quintuple Helix models. It combines and integrates social and natural systems
and environments, stressing the importance of diversity of agents. This can result in democracy
of knowledge led by the pluralism of different paradigms in terms of knowledge and innovation
(Carayannis & Campbell 2011).
Science and technology are increasingly considered as main sources of sustainable and
competitive advantages for regions and nations. However, the determining factor for its
effectiveness is the quality and quantity of entrepreneurship-enabled innovation to unlock
and capture the financial benefits of science in the form of private, public or hybrid goods
(Carayannis & Campbell 2011).
Currently, we are increasingly involved in a globalized knowledge-based economy, marked
by increasing turbulence, uncertainty and ambiguity. This new reality began to emerge in the
90s of twentieth century, when Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) have
revolutionized communications, facilitating access and wide dissemination of knowledge. In
the theoretical literature, this revolution has been widely studied and new ways of producing
innovation are highlighted. The open innovation is one of that forms (Johannessen & Olsen
2010). It has deserved particular attention in recent years not only by academia and policymakers but also by the business sector (Papadopoulos et al. 2013).
Innovation for Resilience

All organizations from different sectors of activity use any product or process that directly
influences its competitiveness, which motivates them to get the innovation they need or that
contributes to its efficiency internally or externally (Robertson et al. 2012).
Since, in 2003, Henry Chesbrough published a paper on this issue, open innovation is
being debated not only in the domain of innovation management, but also in others areas of
knowledge. Although there is no single and completely clear definition of concept, as the name
indicates, the base premise is the opening of innovation process to the outside, in a movement
that takes place in both directions - inside knowledge flows from organizations or business to
the outside and the outside knowledge flows to the inside of organizations or business - with
the aim of accelerating internal production of innovation and expand markets where innovation
is placed (Huizingh 2011).
Open innovation reflects the free transfer of knowledge between multiple partners
(Alexander & Martin 2013). But it depends not only on circulation of knowledge as well as its
incorporation by organizations or business and its effective application (Robertson et al. 2012).
It is related to the collective intelligence (involvement in communities where is possible to deal
with different ways of thinking and acting) and with participation in innovative communities
that relate voluntarily (Papadopoulos et al. 2013).
Carayannis wrote about open innovation diplomacy, in the context of Quadruple and
Quintuple Helix models, arguing that it is the concept and practice of shortening distances and
minimizing obstacles (cultural, socio-economic, technological) through initiatives that promote
the connection of ideas and solutions, evaluated and potentiated by the markets and investors.
In this sense, open innovation diplomacy qualifies a new strategy, a new way of doing politics
and a new governance approach (Carayannis & Campbell 2011).

Cities and economic development
Challenges and local responses
Cities of developed countries made the transition to knowledge-based economies mainly in
the 80s of the twentieth century. Contours of these economies are different depending on the
characteristics of cities (van Geenhuizen & Nijkamp 2012).
In the 90s of twentieth century, the dynamics and impacts of economic globalization
became particularly evident, and instead of a loss of importance of local in new geographies of
global influence, it occur the affirmation of local on global and of global on local. Glocalization,
in the interconnection between the different scales of action and influence, has become one
of the most important phenomenon of contemporaneity (Seixas maio 2013). As a process of
interpenetration of convergent systems, networks and innovation sectors, driven increasingly by
complex, non-linear and dynamic processes of creation, dissemination and use of knowledge,
glocalization confronts us with the need to reconceptualize the ways and means of production,
use and renewal of knowledge (Carayannis & Campbell 2011).
Cities are par excellence locals of generation, dissemination and accumulation of knowledge,
which is central to the phenomena of innovation and economic growth (Fujita & Krugman 2004).
153

A significant and growing proportion of economic activities of the countries is located in urban
areas as a result of proximity and density of externalities. Urban contexts are characterized by
the diversity and density of organizations, companies and people, which, in turn, attract new
economic activities necessary to meet the arising needs and expectations of this concentration
of people, business and organizations (Nijkamp & Kourtit 2013)
Sectoral diversity of urban economies provides a creative environment (Caragliu et al. 2012).
The diversity of assets (knowledge institutes, economic diversity, labor market dimension, cultural animation, international orientation, consumption values) attract talent, knowledge-intensive investment and makes them friendly places to innovation and entrepreneurship (Carvalho
et al. 2014).
The structure and organization of the economy result from individual actions and behavior
of many economic agents (individuals, families, business, government institutions, diversified
organizations). In evolutionary economic geography, entrepreneurs and consumers are consi­
dered basic units of analysis at the micro level (Boschma & Martin 2010). Economic and social
phenomena are closely related and there is consensus in the scientific literature that should be
analyzed in a complementary way (Bathelt & Glückler 2003).
Urban planners, economic geographers and policy makers recognize that the factors
underlying the economic growth of cities are increasingly intangible (such as institutions and
culture) and of increased mobility (such as financial capital, codified knowledge and, in part,
human capital). There is also the recognition that innovation is a cyclical process, resulting from
interaction of different actors in networks (Nijkamp & Kourtit 2013).
A system, as in the case of a city, is more resilient when in a state of reorganization, growth
and innovation. After a shock (as it was, in the past, suburbanization of retail activities) city
centres may simply resist without significant changes, modernize with significant changes that
change its character, or be resilient, maintaining their key attributes and identity but adapting
to new economic, social and cultural contexts. In these times of economic-financial crisis it
has been promoted a new approach of urban management, with a strong link between the
regeneration of the city centre and the resilience of the retail sector. The relationship between
urban spaces, retail activities, planning structures and actions and governance are different from
country to country and even at the local level. On the same street where the same policies and
the same cultural contexts are applied, we can find different answers from retail entrepreneurs
and different reactions / actions by consumers (Fernandes & Chamusca 2014).
Global phenomena, such as the consequences of the financial crisis for consumer purchasing
power, the rising prices of basic goods, the demographic trends (notably the aging population)
and the effort towards sustainability, pose challenges to the current business models and
processes in the retail sector (CE 31/01/2013). The retail sector include all resale activities of
new or used goods for consumption of individuals, companies or institutions, through various
formats, including fixed establishments, fairs and markets, doorstep or correspondence selling,
peddling or e-commerce (Barreta junho 2012).
Innovation is one of the crucial factors in ensuring economic growth. Retailers are important
innovation vectors. They contribute to form and follow closely consumer trends, conveying this
information to suppliers. They act as innovation multipliers, adopting and applying innovative
technologies quickly throughout the supply chain (CE 31/01/2013).
Innovation for Resilience

The characteristics of entrepreneurs, their networks and capacity of investment, innovation
and anticipation of change are key aspects of designing and implementing successful adaptation
strategies, with consequences for the decline or prosperity of retail areas in the urban context
(Barata-Salgueiro 2014).
It is recognized that retail sector has undergone significant changes in recent decades. Small
street shops gradually lost importance and sought to add additional value to the goods in an
attempt to reach new consumers. Specializations, locations, shapes and formats multiplied and
modes of operation diversified and the size of firms and the interactions between producers
and consumers have also changed considerably (Fernandes & Chamusca 2014). The significant
expansion of e-commerce has led to greater competition between traditional retailers and
online distribution channels (CE 31/01/2013).
Nevertheless, the retail sector was, is and always will be an urban activity par excellence
(Cachinho 2014). There is also consensus that consumption patterns change considerably
in recent decades, in terms of requirements, values, practices and power of consumption.
Shopping became increasingly associated with leisure, entertainment and social distinction
(Barata-Salgueiro 2014). Consumer preferences are nowadays much more heterogeneous and
of highly individual nature (Seixas maio 2013). Consumers constantly renew their needs and
above all their desires and expectations, change their behavior and lifestyles. This has direct
consequences for trade activities, involving challenges to entrepreneurs in order to survive.
Currently, the private sector investment in terms of attraction of consumers is intended not only
sell goods and provide services but also to provide new retail concepts, pleasant ambiances, new
or different types of goods or services and multiple opportunities and consumer experiences
(Cachinho 2014; Fernandes & Chamusca 2014; Sorescu et al. 2011). Retailers are best described
as ecosystems conductors where is created value delivered to consumers and appropriate by
entrepreneur and their business partners (Sorescu et al. 2011).

Entrepreneurship and bottom-up initiatives
Entrepreneurship research dates from 1755 when Cantillon introduced the term entrepreneur
in his Essai sur la nature du commerce en géneral. Since then, this topic has been of particular
attention to researchers and policy makers because of the recognition that it is essential for the
development and economic growth, job creation and innovation (Simón-Moya et al. 2014).
Over the past two decades there has been a strengthening of entrepreneurship research,
with particular attention to the spatial dimension of entrepreneurial activities and its causes
and effects. There is still a long way to go to arrive at a theory or at least a theoretical framework to explain the processes, causes and effects of entrepreneurship in urban areas (Bosma
& Sternberg 2014). The current economic situation encourages research on the driving forces
of economic growth. Entrepreneurship has a positive effect on economic growth by generating economic activity. Schumpeter and many other authors have argued in the early twentieth
century that entrepreneurship and innovation was becoming gradually a driving force of job
creation and economic growth (Audretsch 2015; Castaño et al. 2015; Galindo & Méndez 2014).
Thus, determine the factors that lead to entrepreneurship has become important in academia,
155

namely in an attempt to support the formulation of policies that create conditions for their development (Castaño et al. 2015).
The scientific literature explains entrepreneurship as a product of local context and characteristics of individuals. The territories are endowed with different infrastructures of knowledge,
institutions and resources. Individuals are heterogeneous with regard to knowledge, skills, va­
lues and preferences that guide their motivations and behaviors. Thus, the entrepreneurship
process depends on the opportunities offered by the territories and the capacity and motivation
of individuals to identify, evaluate and exploit these opportunities. In other words, for people
with the same individual characteristics territorial context can make a difference in the extent
that can favor an entrepreneurial attitude or, on the contrary, inhibit it (Boschma & Martin 2010;
Bosma & Sternberg 2014).
Urban areas are particularly privileged in what concern to the existence of favorable
conditions for entrepreneurial process. Characterized by a high population density and a strong
flow of people (inhabitants, workers, visitors), they facilitate the increase and diversification of
demand and the access to inputs needed for production of goods and services (financial capital,
labor, suppliers, among others) (García 2014).
With regard in particular to urban markets, various international organizations recognize
that this form of economic activity, very ancient in its origins but with innovative contours today,
have advantages to urban areas in economic, social, cultural and even environmental domains.
They create employment and entrepreneurship opportunities, to the extent that allow people
with micro businesses to show their work, products and skills (NABMA Sem data; URBACT
março 2015).
Several studies emphasize that entrepreneurs do not work in social, cultural or economic
isolation. They are encouraged or constrained by local societal and organizational infrastructure.
Entrepreneurship takes place in a specific environment in which the entrepreneur looks for
employees, business partners and consumers. The spatial, temporal, social, historical and
institutional context should be taken into account to the extent that generates opportunities
or limitations to entrepreneurship (García 2014). Education, especially higher education, is
an important factor in that it provides the acquisition of skills and attitudes conducive to
entrepreneurship, contributing to a greater ability to identify opportunities (García 2014; SimónMoya et al. 2014). There are, however, some studies indicating a reverse situation. In some
European cities are the low skills that lead to entrepreneurship (García 2014).
Urban areas provide contexts that facilitate the identification and access to business
opportunities and fruitful collaborations by contact with people with information, knowledge,
skills and business experience and they also enable contact with the most qualified individuals in
the same or related fields of knowledge. The possibility of learning with these people stimulates
the accumulation of human capital in urban environments and can lead to the creation and
recognition of business opportunities (Bosma & Sternberg 2014).
On the other hand, the institutional context, the planning system or the model of governance
are factors to equate. National and local policies connected with the establishments licensing
rules, public support for retailers, the structure of the city (monocentric or polycentric) and the
importance of regeneration policies provide the environment for investment decisions (BarataSalgueiro 2014).
Innovation for Resilience

Estrin et al. (2013) and Simón-Moya et al. (2014) emphasize the importance of the institutional context. Institutions can be formal (such as the laws or regulations where is defined the
economic incentives and bureaucratic costs that influence individual and organizational choices)
or informal (social, cultural or religious norms, customs, traditions, believes). Informal institutions
are socially rooted and are therefore more difficult to change. They develop informally over time.
The authors report that a growing number of academic studies shows that entrepreneurial acti­
vity is strongly influenced by the institutional context: the strategies of entrepreneurs reflect the
opportunities and limitations set by institutions. They create the incentive structures determining
the choice of entrepreneurship at the expense of other forms of occupation, as well the type of
entrepreneurship and business dimension. Estrin et al. argue that local social networks can, in
some extent, mitigate negative impact of an unfavorable institutional environment, by facilitating
access to the resources needed to creation of business and to counseling and support.
Castaño et al. (2015) noted the importance of cultural factors and economic performance of
the territories, to the extent that this performance being positive generates positive economic
expectations and improves the perception of opportunities, motivating individuals to engage in
entrepreneurial activities. Innovations produced by entrepreneurs are, in their opinion, encoura­
gement factors for others to enter the world of entrepreneurship and innovation. Galindo and
Méndez (2014) find that there is a circular effect between innovation, economic growth and
entrepreneurship, in that these three phenomena influence each other positively.
In scientific literature are identified two fundamental types of entrepreneurship according
to motivation: entrepreneurship by opportunity and entrepreneurship by necessity. While
entrepreneurship by opportunity is the most common, entrepreneurship by necessity is quite
significant in many urban contexts. The entrepreneurs by necessity are defined as people
compelled to start a business because they have no other job opportunities and need a source of
income or people who are expecting to lose their jobs or already in a situation of unemployment.
Urban areas with high unemployment rates may have higher occurrences of entrepreneurship
by necessity (Bosma & Sternberg 2014).
In a study about entrepreneurship in European cities, Bosma and Sternberg (2014) concluded
that urban areas characterized by economic growth and diversity of economic activities (more
than specialization) have more entrepreneurs motivated by opportunity.
Taylor, in a study of forms of self-employment in the UK, says that statistics on employment
indicate a growing number of people who are self-employed. The discussion around this topic
is complex due to the variety and diversity of possibilities that fall under this designation, that
includes the self-employed with employees, the freelancers, those who have their small business
assembled at home, among others. The author points out that is increasingly self-employment
by unemployed, elderly people with insufficient pensions or people with a second job. In their
opinion, these are not the entrepreneurs considered potential drivers of economic prosperity,
but marginalized figures of economies (Taylor 2015).
In a comparative study of English communities, Bailey and Madeleine (2015) concluded
that the top-down initiatives led by government institutions tend to result in a smaller community empowerment, while the bottom-up initiatives which may in part be supported by the
statecreate opportunities with potential for higher levels of transformation. However, the most
prosperous areas, with skilled people and greater involvement in business, are more likely to
157

take advantage of these opportunities than the most depressed areas.
In relation to entrepreneurship measurement, Estrin et al. (2013) believe that the combination
of theories about entrepreneurship and the empirical testing of hypotheses is not a trivial matter,
as they consider that entrepreneurship is often measured imperfectly. Several authors have
used new business registered and self-employment as proxies of entrepreneurship. The former
is used as indicative of entrepreneurship dynamics. The self-employment is understood as the
creation of income through a business in individual name or professional activity. It is used as
a proxy measure since many of these businesses grow and create jobs. However, there is the
awareness that not all self-employed are entrepreneurs (García 2014). Galindo and Méndez
(2014) used private investment as proxy of entrepreneurship.
In terms of public policies and strategies, at the turn of the twenty-first century, the Lisbon
Strategy guidelines aimed making Europe the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based
economy, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs. The Strategy
underlined the role of entrepreneurship in adaptation to economic changes and increased
competitiveness, emphasizing the need to provide a favorable environment for the creation
and development of small and medium enterprises (García 2014). It was succeeded by Strategy
Europe 2020, focused on smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, highlighting the importance
of entrepreneurship for achievement of these goals (CE 3/03/2010). The European Commission
in European Action Plan for Retail Sector defines as strategic goals: to meet the challenges the
retail sector face nowadays, to implement the single market in this sector and to create a coherent
and comprehensive strategy to contribute to their full operationalization. It is recognized in the
document that to pursuit these objectives is necessary not only measures imposed from the
top to the bottom but it is strongly required the active cooperation and initiative of retailers
themselves (CE 31/01/2013).

It is our aim to analyze bottom-up initiatives of economic entrepreneurship in Oporto city
centre retail sector. Our objects of study are fixed establishments, fairs and markets.
In terms of geographical area of reference, it should be noted that there is no defined and
agreed limit of the centre of Oporto.
In Figure 2, we can see the limit of Historic Centre of Oporto (UNESCO World Heritage
since 1996) and the limit of Urban Rehabilitation Areas defined by the municipality. City
centre is considered broader than the Historic Centre but not as extensive as the limit of Urban
Rehabilitation Areas. In this work we consider the limit of Urban Rehabilitation Areas as city
centre because it would be reductive and misleading choose the lowest limit.

Bottom-up initiatives in Oporto city centre

The city of Oporto has reached in recent years a greater visibility at national and international
level. Its landscape, the architectural and cultural heritage, the emblematic equipment (such
as Music House and Serralves Foundation and Gardens) and recreational and cultural events,
as well as evening entertainment, especially in the centre, are factors of attraction of people.
The growth of tourism along with the number of residents, workers, students and other users
who use the city in their day to day contribute to the large flow of people at different times of
the day, generating diverse experiences of the city, in general, and of its centre, in particular.
The centre has always played an important role in the history of the city as an important economic hub and is nowadays the center of political and institutional decision of the municipality.
In 2000, economy of Oporto city centre was heavily focused on the trade of various formats,
from traditional shopping streets, traditional fairs and peddling to shopping centers and galle­
ries (Quaternaire 2000). Since then many changes occur.
However, as is characteristic of European cities, retail sector is linked to Oporto from its
beginning, being a key aspect in understanding the development of city in general and in particular of its centre (Fernandes 1997).

In terms of methodology, it should be noted that there is no statistical information related
to the topic available to our analysis scale, so that could not be tested indicators referred
in scientific literature. Our results are based in 24 semi-structured interviews, made during
2015, to entrepreneurs of different types and formats of economic activity. Respondents were
owners, managers or employees of fixed establishments and responsible for management and
organization of urban markets. Once the centre of Oporto is diverse in terms of establishments
opening date, having also centenarians business, they were interviewed older establishments
and establishments recently opened (Figure 3). The goal is to analyze the features of recent
business in what concerns to relationship with consumers, entrepreneurship and innovation as
well innovation and adapting strategies to new consumer expectations in the case of business
that endure for decades. It is considered old business those that opened during the last century.
We used content analysis to analyze the interviews. This is considered one of the most
elaborate techniques in the field of documentary observation (Bravo 1994).
We also used direct observation. It was used a framework with aspects on which it was
intended to gather information.

Innovation for Resilience

Results
In Oporto city centre, recent years are marked by new dynamics in terms of strengthening
and diversification of the hotel establishments, the revitalization of coffees and restaurants,
the diversification of street commercial establishments and the promotion of urban markets
and craft fairs. There has been an increasing number of establishments that not only have
the product commercialization component but also, associated with it, there is a cultural and
entertainment component. We refer for example bars and nightclubs that have spaces suitable
for holding live concerts and diversified art exhibitions (Figure 4).
In what concerns to the fixed establishments, in the oldest ones there is majority a family
heritage, the management passes from parents to children who want to continue a profitable
business. In the case of the most recent establishments, respondents reported that the opening
of business was due, in some cases, to situations of unemployment or precarious employment
and, in other cases, because they work in the type of economic activity concerned or because
they are somehow linked to that activity, aspiring to have their own business where they could
apply their ideas.
The so-called fairs and urban markets, with more modern and innovative characteristics,
began to emerge in 2009 in Oporto. They differ from traditional fairs and markets because of
products marketed, the promotion of small businesses and brands, the animation associated to
them and because they bring new audiences and experiences to urban spaces (Figure 5). Their
achievement arises from the awareness that there was a shortage in Oporto of similar initiatives
to those observed in other European cities. The main objective behind the organization effort
of the markets relates generally to the stimulation of urban spaces, the revitalization of more
or less forgotten areas and to the promotion of recreational and cultural activities of squares
or streets, generating flows of people - residents, visitors and tourists - and attracting new
audiences, new business, new experiences.
In the case of the oldest business establishments, expectations surrounding them focus on
to succeed, create jobs, become increasingly known and keep pace with the new demands of
consumers in order to increase or at least maintain customers. Newer businesses have the same
expectations, however are still in process of affirmation and recognition of the business. The
respondents refer that there are opened many properties in recent years, which it is positive, on
one hand, because reflects significant economic dynamics of city centre; on the other hand, it
creates more uncertainty because it represents in many cases competition.
In terms of difficulties in the implementation of the business idea, respondents particularly
stress the lack of investment capacity, the difficulty of funding access and the excessive bureaucracy in licensing (we are talking about establishments opened before legal rules that facilitated
the creation of business) and the high tax burden. The high rent of spaces that are practiced
in city centre is referred as another difficulty, particularly by newer establishments. The oldest
establishments reported that the opening of large shopping centers in the past was a challenge
by their strong competition. Respondents related to urban markets indicate that in implementing its initiative they experienced difficulties with obtaining the necessary licenses, considered
a very bureaucratic process. Today, the weather is a problem for outdoor markets and is not
always easy to find appropriate locations - either because they are private and the owners have
Innovation for Resilience

no interest in letting occupy the space, or because the spaces are small or even, in the case of
public spaces, the municipality is not always in accordance with the chosen locations. Finally,
they refer the lack of financial support as an obstacle in improving the conditions of events,
both for sellers as to shoppers and other visitors, and the lack of an effective and efficient public
strategy of boosting the urban fairs and markets.
When asked what they consider most innovative in their business, respondents of the
oldest establishments report that is the ability to combine tradition and innovation, that is
keep the old customers loyalty and the traditional character of the property at the same time
that are up to date in what concerns to the needs and expectations of customers and to the
modernization of services and technologies associated with the selling process. This last aspect
is also highlighted in the more recent business inquired. The quality of products and services,
the sale of original products or products with a distinguishing feature, the creation of a warm
and pleasant environment are the most mentioned aspects by respondents related to the most
recent establishments and to the markets.
The location in the city centre brings advantages derived from the centrality of the area,
particularly in terms of the high concentration of shops and services and, to that extent, a
large supply area is more prone to an increased demand. The flow of people is greater and the
potential number of customers is naturally higher.
Tourists generate a greater flow of people and strengthen the economic activity of city centre. The older, traditional and well established retail establishments (like grocery stores, herba­
lists, pharmacies, jewelry shops or bookstores) do not consider to have great benefits of these
positive dynamics, with the exception of the flagship establishments (such as Lello Bookstore
for example) that are themselves tourist attractions. Recent hotel establishments (and we refer
particularly the hostels) opened because of the opportunities created by the increasing tourist
attractiveness of the centre in recent years and currently benefit from this same attractiveness.
Personal and business networks are valued as ways to access the support they need or
the information necessary to originate added value for their business. In the case of urban
markets, the connection with the surrounding community and, in particular, establishments
in the area, is a constant concern in order to generate mutual gains. The establishment of
social relations between sellers, between them and clients or even among people who are
in the events, is considered a positive impact of the markets. Responsible for markets aim to
promote contact between people and business, to create conditions for the establishment of
personal and professional networks that could result in future connections and also to create an
environment conducive to the emergence of new ideas. Urban markets are seen as environments
of commercial trading, but also of creativity, innovation, interaction and cultural activities.
The vast majority of respondents stated that they had no institutional support and don’t
miss it; three respondents reported having the support of Oporto Merchants Association,
which they consider very important; the three respondents responsible for organizing the
urban markets have support from the municipal company Porto Lazer (with technical issues sound and power - and bureaucratic issues, like granting of licenses for use of the spaces, as
well as with dissemination of the markets), considering this an essential support that should
be strengthened. Only one respondent reported having institutional support from a specific
association related to his type of economic activity.
161

When asked what kind of support municipality could give to contribute to the development
of their business in particular and the economic activity of the city centre in general, the most
mentioned aspects respondents refer are the financial support, particularly for the rehabilitation
of buildings, that in many cases are very degraded and thus unattractive at the outside; the
availability of free parking or parking at more affordable prices than those currently practiced;
the bureaucratic simplification and the increased security on the streets. It should be noted that
four of the respondents mentioned that whenever contacted municipality requesting support
it has been demonstrated willingness to collaborate and there was in fact effective support by
the municipality of Oporto.

Conclusions
Since the 90s of twentieth century, the dynamics and impacts of economic globalization
became particularly evident in cities of developed countries, occurring the affirmation of local
on global and of global on local – the phenomenon of glocalization.
Urban planners, economic geographers and policy makers recognize that the factors
underlying the economic growth of cities are increasingly intangible and of increased mobility.
There is also the recognition that innovation is a cyclical process, resulting from interaction of
different actors in networks. In these times of economic-financial crisis it has been promoted a
new approach of urban management, with a strong link between the regeneration of the city
centre and the resilience of the retail sector. On the same street where the same policies and the
same cultural contexts are applied, we can find different answers from retail entrepreneurs and
different reactions / actions by consumers. The characteristics of entrepreneurs, their networks
and capacity of investment, innovation and anticipation of change are key aspects of designing
and implementing successful adaptation strategies, with consequences for the decline or
prosperity of retail areas in the urban context.
Consumers are constantly renewing their needs, desires and expectations, changing
their behavior and lifestyles. This has direct consequences for retail activities, challenging
entrepreneurs to keep up to date with customer’s trends. The scientific literature explains
entrepreneurship as a product of local context and characteristics of individuals. The territories
are endowed with different infrastructures of knowledge, institutions and resources. Individuals
are heterogeneous with regard to knowledge, skills, values and preferences that guide their
motivations and behaviors. Thus, the entrepreneurship process depends on the opportunities
offered by the territories and the capacity and motivation of individuals to identify, evaluate and
exploit these opportunities.
Our focus in this work was the analysis of bottom-up initiatives of economic entrepreneurship in Oporto city centre retail sector. Our research was based on 24 interviews and direct
observation of fixed establishments, fairs and markets. We conclude that coexist in Oporto city
centre different situations: the situation of those who have inherited a family business, adapting
it over time to the needs and expectations of consumers; the situation of those who opened
more recently a business because in a situation of unemployment or job insecurity or because
they wished to have their own business. There is also the situation of those who, through
observation of other European cities, have taken the initiative to organize and manage urban
markets, aware of a gap at this level in our study area. The latter two situations clearly show
an entrepreneurial spirit, of who identifies and takes advantage of opportunities created by the
current economic dynamics, largely powered by the growing importance of tourism in the city
in general and in its centre in particular. Respondents denote the concern on keep up to date
in what concerns meet the needs and expectations of consumers. In older business is also the
concern to update the technologies associated with the selling process.
Consumers are actors of economic initiatives, in that nowadays they experience while
shopping. The innovation strategies of entrepreneurs pass through providing experiences, by
creating pleasant establishment environments, inviting to fruition, apart from the innovation in
terms of products (new or with differentiating characteristics), forms of marketing and cultural

and playful animation of spaces. This is particularly clear in the case of bottom-up initiatives
related to fairs and urban markets were music, dance and other art demonstrations are almost
always present.
A last idea, it should be noted that entrepreneurship stems from an identity development
strategy supported on empowerment of agents, upon their resources and possibilities
of intervention, in order to improve their living conditions. It is also important to note the
importance of do-it-yourself that underlies many of the initiatives, based on the possibility of
making part of stakeholders, taking into their own hands the destiny of their lives. For example,
many of the hostels are born of this principle, but also many bars / concert halls and art galleries
or urban markets. The issues of innovation, knowledge, information and learning are critical in
these empowerment processes.

CHAPTER 8

Technological Learning: Experience Curve as a Resilient
Learning Mechanism
Teresa de Noronha
Victoria del Pino

Introduction
Literature on knowledge has evolved significantly since the pioneering works of Paul Romer,
becoming multi-faceted. Theories of knowledge acquisition suggest that organizations facing
similar changes vary in their capacity to learn due to cognitive (Senge, 1990), interpersonal
(Argyris and Schon, 1978), structural (Duncan and Weiss, 1979), or managerial (Dutton and
Thomas, 1984) factors, and even fail to learn (Hirsch, 1952). In general terms, researchers
have all come to a general consensus that, when pursuing a development goal, embodying
knowledge should be a priority task in modern organisations.
Thus, it is not surprising that, more recently, management literature has been focused
on the management of organisational knowledge including the intangible dimensions of the
organisation (Von Krogh et al., 2001), and has been conducted within the frameworks provided
by economic theories1. Therefore, there is now a clearer understanding of the nature of
knowledge (relationships between data, information and knowledge; between tacit and explicit
knowledge; between individual and organization knowledge; between types of thinking), and
of the dynamics of knowledge (knowledge acquisition and learning mechanisms, knowledge
conversion, knowledge dissemination and knowledge application) in organisational contexts.
Eventually, knowledge accumulation in firms should lead to cost reductions and rising
revenues, and from a micro-economic perspective, and assuming the positive contribution of
firms for the dynamics of socio-economic change (Schumpeter, 1947), the economic evolution
is a process of continuous cumulative learning (Rothschild, 2004).
The cumulative learning can be quantitatively captured in a so-called ‘learning curve’ (LC).
The LC concept is based on the empirical observation that the costs of a product fall by a constant
proportion with every doubling of cumulative production. Nowadays, the dominant stream
of literature of the knowledge management (KM) science assumes that these cost reductions
reflect, not only the benefits from learning-by-doing, but also the benefits derived from other
types of learning mechanisms, such as learning-by-using, learning-by-searching, learning-byinteracting, and more recently learning-by-learning and learning-by-expanding. All the learning

mechanisms play a different, thus relevant, role in the learning organisation, and their effects
are collectively reflected in the experience accumulation. The concept ‘experience curve’ (EC) is
based on the intuitive idea that the time required to perform a task decreases as a worker gains
experience (BCG, 1968, 1972, 1974).
One could argue that “riding down”2 the EC will bring short-term profits while accumulating
experience by producing the same old product, but this simplistic vision masks the forcefulness
of innovation and knowledge accumulation. In fact, firms need to be focused on re-enforcing
their own competencies, not only to embody as much experience and knowledge as possible
to achieve a rapid unitary cost reduction in the same product, but if possible, transferring this
to new challenging outputs for the permanent changing consumer preferences. After all, the
market decides the final form of the production function through an intense and interactive
process of innovation. The learning associated with innovative activities is not a purely individual
phenomenon, for the increasing complexity of innovation it is required a collective and interactive
process. Several researchers have even looked at consumers as co-creators of products and
value (Prahalad, 2004), as co-innovators (Von Hippel and Katz, 2002), and as ‘prosumers’3 who
both produce and consume (Xie et. al, 2007).
Indeed, innovation is highly influenced by vertical cooperation, not only with consumers,
but also with suppliers and customers, especially in low-tech firms where the development of
new products or processes often takes into account new demands and market changes (Vaz
and Nijkamp, 2009). Companies that are better able to utilise information and knowledge can
make decisions faster and closer to the point of action, overcome internal and external barriers,
provide more opportunities to innovate, reduce product development time and enhance
customer relationships (Hackett, 2000).
Firms learn differently, depending on several endogenous and exogenous factors and timedependent stages, and through distinctive learning mechanisms. Theoretically, if knowledge
can be managed (Alavi and Leidner, 2001; Chen and Chen, 2006), experience and knowledge
accumulation could be accelerated via KM through differentiated learning mechanisms
promotion, improving the pace of innovative activities. If innovation is rapidly endogenised, the
firm is ready and prepared to shorten the innovative lag-phase and launch another innovation.
But in this complex process, the idea of learning as a driver of cost reduction still remains
very attractive. Learners (or workers) become better at doing what they do over time, leading to
efficiency increases and permanent cost reductions, at a profit business level. The implications
of both “practice makes perfect” and “performance improves with experience” effects have
held up remarkably well over time (Pisano et al., 2001), and are reflected on the EC concept.

Theoretical Framing and Discussion
A case-study approach was chosen as the main research methodology. Related to a particular
biotechnology, the Microalgae Production Systems (MPS) that have been installed and in
operation in the company Necton – Companhia Portuguesa de Culturas Marinhas S.A. (Necton,
hereinafter), a pioneering Portuguese company. It is an unique experiment as it is the first time
to examine the EC of MPS and provide a promising contribution into long-term research in
a transversal field of linking technological processes to economic and management sciences.
The model we pursue is based on the following analytical sequence: i) Organisational
learning mechanisms such as described in Table 1, where the different conceptual approaches
are listened; ii) Learning and experience curves resulting from gains in learning by doing; iii)
the upcoming of competitiveness of new and innovative products and processes; iv) How can
modelling and policy support decision tools be effective.

i) Organisational learning mechanisms
As summarised in Table 1, organisational knowledge can be acquired in different ways,
through formal research and work development, or through learning as doers or users. But
surprisingly, and even though users intensively influence the innovation process, the learningby-using mechanism has not been studied enough. Although Rosenberg (1982) has highlighted
the critical role of the ‘user learning’ for several technologies, this field has received little empirical attention.
More recently, the concept of “communities of practice”4 (COP) has become increasingly
influential within the KM literature. COP are “groups of people who share a passion
for something that they know how to do and who interact regularly to learn how to do it
better” (www.ewenger.com). Intentionally created, COP are currently being used to facilitate
knowledge transfer within firms, as the tacit aspects of knowledge are often the most valuable,
as they consist of embodied expertise (Ramalho and Sarmento, 2004). Furthermore, presently,
codified knowledge is losing part of its strength as a source of competitive advantage, and
tacit knowledge is reinforcing its significance as a mean of adapting to new requirements and
therefore, spatial proximity to sources of relevant knowledge creation is becoming central (Vaz
and Nijkamp, 2009).

The expression “riding down” was borrowed from Jakob and Madlener (2004).

The term ‘prosumer’ is a late 20 th century concept that combines some of the common characteristics of a producer and a
consumer, and is generally applied to situations where consumers are considered to have reached a level of sophistication
and such a strong working knowledge, that the consumer can effectively dictate the production or re-design of goods
and services. More information about the ‘prosumer’ concept can be found elsewhere (Prosumer Studies Working Group
at http://www.bsos.umd.edu/socy/prosumer/about.html).

The COP concept was originally developed by Lave and Wenger (1991) in a study of situated learning.

Brief Description

Learning-by-doing
(Arrow, 1962)

Learning from experience in production processes. Know-how produced
by experience can be regarded as tacit knowledge, residing in individuals,
organisational routines and manufacturing practices. Also described as
first-order learning.

Learning-by-searching
(Boulding, 1985)
(Johnson, 1992)

Knowledge brought forward by R&D. Knowledge more concentrated on
“know-why”; knowledge development on general concepts and principles.

Learning-by-using
(Rosenberg, 1982)

Solutions are found in practice and optimised according to experience.
Also described as “know-what”.

Learning-by-interacting
(Foray & Lundval, 1998)

Knowledge transfer between users, producers, research institutes and
policy makers. Knowledge transfer is more intense whenever relevant
information is exchanged. Also described as “know-who” knowledge.

Learning-by-learning
(Rotmans and Kemp, 2003)

Primary learning processes improve over time, and more intensively if
learning strategies are developed, applied and evaluated. Also described
as reflexive learning or second-order learning.

Learning-by- expanding
(Schaeffer, 2004)

If a process/technology is frequently applied, more actors, organisational
structures and industrial sectors will become involved in, focused on,
dependent on and adapted to the new technology. Also described as
“‘learning-by-expanding” or “learning-by-network growth” or “learningby-embedding”.

ii) Learning and experience curves resulting from gains in learning by doing
Learning and experience curves analyses result from LC models initially developed from the
basic premise that individuals and organisations acquire knowledge by doing work. More recently,
it has been proposed that organisations learn by using, interacting, searching and expanding.
Thus, through different learning mechanisms, organisations and individuals develop relatively
permanent changes in behaviour, accumulating experience. As more products are produced
by a manufacturer, the cost per unit of the product often decreases at a determined rate. This
phenomenon is represented by an exponential curve, also known as the EC. The organization
gains a competitive advantage when it converts the cost reductions into productivity gains.
However, the trickiest attribute of experience accumulation is its strategic importance, due to
the fact that experience cannot be traded.
As learning is often equated with experience, the terms LC, EC, “progress curve”, and
“learning-by-doing curve” are frequently used interchangeably. Generally, the term EC is more of
a macro-concept, while the term LC is a micro-concept. The term LC refers to the phenomenon
that unit production costs typically decrease over time, and the LC effects are considered

restricted to learning effects of the workers (learners). In contrast, the EC effects comprise
learning effects of the whole firms and entire industries, such as learning trough research and
learning trough scale-production and up-scaling of individual products (IEA, 2000).

iii) The upcoming of competitiveness of new and innovative products and processes
Competitiveness of new and innovative products and processes are essential to innovative
occurrence and several classical definitions of innovation can be found in the literature (e.g.
Utterback, 1994; Frascati Manual, 2002; Oslo Manual, 2005). Nevertheless, almost all definitions
include the concepts of novelty, commercialisation and/or implementation. In other words, if an
idea has not been developed and transformed into a product, process or service, or it has not
been commercialised, it should be classified as an innovation.
Sure, the way innovative technologies develop and diffuse is characterised by various stages,
from invention to widespread implementation. Different learning mechanisms play a role in each
of these stages. The learning process will lead to technological change and to cost reductions
(Neij et al., 2003; Junginger, 2004, 2005). Therefore, the EC approach can help to measure and
quantify the aggregated effect of technological development and should not be neglected.
A technological discontinuity, also called radical innovation, marks the onset of a new
technology. It is “based on a different set of engineering and scientific principles and often
opens up whole new markets and potential applications” (Henderson and Clark, 1990). In
consequence of the occurrence of a technological discontinuity, the EC can come to an abrupt
stop (see Figure 1). This event is represented graphically by a curve truncation. Whenever such a
phenomenon is identified, a red alert should be displayed in the ‘competition monitoring device’
of the firm, which means that existing processes become obsolete and the firm should upgrade
to remain competitive. The upgrading will mean that the old EC will be replaced by a new one.
An important implication of the EC, related with technological discontinuity, is that increasing
accumulated experience in the early stages of a technology will create the possibility of developing
a ‘dominant design’ (BCG, 1972). A ‘dominant design’ is a technology management concept that
identifies key technological designs that become the standard in their market place. Firms will
introduce alternative designs until some combination becomes clearly preferred by end-users
and widely accepted as an industry standard (Anderson and Tushman, 1990). Eventhough, the
EC offers no method to predict discontinuities in the learning rate or the eventual occurrence of
a dominant design, it may help at least to identify future barriers that could lead to technological
discontinuities, and point out critical R&D areas. A technological discontinuity appears in the
form of a double knee. Figure 1 illustrates a step in the EC, indicating a change in the entry point
and possibly also in the progress ratio before and after the change (IEA, 2000).

173

Figure 1 – Technological discontinuity

whenever technology diffusion takes place it leads to learning-by-interacting, and, from that
point on, to the last stage of mass production.
The learning process is a result of the development of increasing skill in production, being
therefore a source of innovation that is recognised as a component of the R&D process and
receives no direct expenditures (Foray, 2006).
As the process of innovation is inherently uncertain, prospects for future learning with
existing technologies do not consider breakthroughs (i.e., through R&D investments) and market
developments. One has to be cautious when using EC for innovation forecasting purposes. The
simplistic use of industry-wide EC can easily mask the underlying dynamics of the process of
innovation. It would be wise only to use EC whenever incremental innovations are inferred
as simplification and improvement activities, and avoid using EC for domains where radical
innovations may take place.
Another drawback of EC, indirectly pointed out by Peter Senge (1990), is the “core learning
dilemma” that confronts organisations – organisations learn best from experience but never
directly experience the consequences of many of the organisational strategic decisions.
In an attempt to understand technical complexity of microalgal biotechnology, the learning
process, underlying technology development, was studied through different research questions:
1. Do the MPS of the case-study follow an experience curve? 2. Do closed and open MPS follow
similar experience curves? 3. Do learning mechanisms play different roles across the MPS life-cycle?
In order to answer these questions, two methodologies were applied to the case-study. The
first methodology was based on the EC concept, and its application aimed to answer whether
or not the MPS followed an EC.

iv) How can modelling and policy support decision tools be effective
The ‘technology variant A’ is deployed, but during the transition period investors realise the
advantages of ‘technology variant B’. As the two technology variants are assumed to be similar,
in the transition period for ‘technology variant B’, there is experience accumulation from the
learning process that occurred during ‘technology variant A’ deployment (IEA, 2000).
Emerging technologies pass through several stages before they mature, encompassed by
different learning mechanisms. Among the different organisational learning mechanisms, in
order to achieve an increased market penetration of a technology, learning-by-searching is the
most dominant mechanism in the early phase of technology development (Van Sark, 2008). It
also often plays an important role at later stages, as well, as the effect of R&D on an industry’s
capacity to decrease cost is analogous to experience, because it brings dynamism to economies
or downward shifts in the cost curve (Papineau, 2006).
In the case of niche-market applications, for instance of new technologies, the learning-bydoing mechanism will ultimately promote innovation in the form of continuous improvement.
Foray (2006) claims that, at the micro-economic level, learning-by-doing can be related to
innovation and knowledge production. The researcher also points out the fact that learning-bydoing should not be confused with incremental innovation, because while learning-by-doing
generates only technological or organisational increments, most incremental innovations are
produced only through learning-by-doing mechanisms. After, the initial development phase,
Innovation for Resilience

Newfound interest in EC has arisen in recent years, not only as before, as a production
planning or strategic management tool, but more recently with a focus on achieving reliable
estimates of technological learning rates as inputs in technology forecasting models used for
decision-making for government policies (IEA, 2000; Hettinga et al., 2009; Van den Wall Bake et
al., 2009, Weiss et al., 2010). For instance, figure 2 illustrates the use of learning opportunities
in the power sector in the European Union (EU).

technologies installed in the EU, from the year 1980 to the year 1995 (NGCC stands for
Natural Gas Combined Cycle)

Source: IEA (2000)

Even though, several national energy policies face controversy as electricity customers
are paying more for subsidizing wind farms, surprisingly, according to IEA (2000), electricity
from wind produced at the sites, with best performance, can today compete with electricity
produced in coal-fired power plants; photovoltaics and biomass technology require considerable
improvements in performance before electricity from these technologies can compete with
electricity from fossil fuel technology.
Technological policy decisions should always be supported by reliable estimation and
technology cost forecasts. It is no longer plausible to use the EC methodology to estimate cost
patterns on the basis of a price proxy. It is obvious that new approaches are needed to attenuate
or solve the EC methodology limitations.
Several works have used LC as important tools for technical change modeling and policy
making support. Duke and Kammen (1999) provided a method for evaluating the cost
effectiveness of public policies to support new technologies. Van der Zwaan and Rabl (2004)
have weighted public technology investment against environmental damage costs.
More recently, other works have pointed to the significant uncertainties of key parameters
(Wene, 2000). LC must be used with caution, when inadequately applied, as they may lead to
inappropriate public policies (Papineau, 2006). The importance of caution when applying EC in
early stages of market dynamics for photovoltaic, fuel cell, carbon capture and sequestration
technologies can be stressed as well. Nevertheless, it is important to keep in mind that LC are a
heuristic measure, without a solid theoretical basis.

Results and conclusion
Observing, analysing and reengineering the MPS, or any other innovative sector of the
economic activity, in order to apply knowledge and experience accumulation in technological
adaptations, is constantly required. Therefore, the deeper the knowledge is, and the broader
the experience, the better technologies will work out. For that reason, Necton is an interesting
case-study, as it has been producing microalgae, in a large-scale, since the year 2000, offering
the possibility to medium-long term observation periods.
For the purpose of the present study, only one biotechnological perspective was explored,
regarding the fact that MPS technological performances are largely affected by environmental
parameters. This relational connection with the productive environment is a must. In order to
understand how environmental factors may have affected the biomass productivity, for example,
some parameters were studied in a concise in order to allow that data, regarding environmental
parameters could be compiled and summarised the minimum and maximum values observed
of each parameter, as well as the month and year. Only the inclusion of such values in the
investigation may detect if costs decreased, indeed, by increasing the cumulative production. In
our case these decreased 34.4% for each doubling of cumulative production – a very expressive
result. Both PR obtained are in between the determined PR values for manufacturing industry
(Dutton and Thomas, 1984) and for energy technologies (McDonald and Schrattenholzer, 2001),
that range from 60 % to 100%.
Therefore, several conclusions arise from this finding: a “regular” learning process occurred
along technology instalment and operation; the EC found exclusively resulted from the learning
effects experienced, as no scale effects occurred during firm’s activity; the learning and
experience accumulation from previous technologies installation and daily operation resulted
in higher learning in subsequent technologies. Even though the methodology was successfully
applied, as progress ratios were determined, the longer the technology is producing, the better
the curve fits the EC, and the overall learning process is better understood.
For future research in this field, it would be interesting to know what is the goal, in terms
of techno-economic performance of each type of productive activity or in other words, what
is the maximum production that managers can aspire, and what is the best PR, and what
scenarios may lead to it. These calculations could be pursued using the EC methodology as a
cost-forecasting tool.
Furthermore, and in order to provide more effective results, a technological surveillance
should be set and more data from future production records should be incorporated in followup
of the productive process.
In trying to understand the role of learning mechanisms in the life-cycle of several technologies,
Necton has installed and run four types of different technologies. The technical staff of the company
was asked whether they have experienced or not the different learning mechanisms (learningby-doing, learning-by-searching, learning-by-using, learning-by-interacting) during each lifecycle and the conclusion was that learning mechanisms played different roles in each life-cycle:
A general trend that can be identified is that learning-by-doing is more relevant in the phase
‘growth’ and learning-by-using role has more weight in the ‘maturity’ and ‘decline’ phases
177

of technology. These findings are in accordance with literature. First, the learning-by-doing
mechanism originates as a by-product of economic activity in general, Kamp et al. (2004) claim
that this learning mechanism always exists and that producing is sufficient to trigger it. Second,
learning-by-using can only be assessed after intensive or prolonged use of the technology, while
tasks related with technological optimisation take place (Rosenberg, 1982).
As learning-by-searching is related to the systematic and organised search for new
knowledge, the role of this mechanism became particularly relevant in the ‘growth’ phase of
the raceways and GW technologies, due to the fact that both technologies were the state-ofart when installed. During the interviews, another fact that was mentioned about this type of
learning is that whenever new solutions to improve technology performance were based on
R&D activities, playing a decisive role.
The mechanism of learning-by-interacting was fundamental in the case of GW, as Necton
closely collaborated with the technology developer. The information required to dominate
the technology was tacit and learning occurred during direct face-to-face contacts. Moreover,
during the interviews it was also mentioned that the communication between microalgae
producers has always been scarce, as there were only few players in the market. Therefore, the
role of learning-by-interacting was less noticeable.
It was also possible to conclude that learning-by-doing may not be the only factor underlying
the learning process with the firm, and technology development is a reflection of all effects,
including the effects of other learning mechanisms, such as learning-by-searching, learning-byusing and learning-by-interacting. In general terms, the role of learning-by-doing is more relevant
in initial phases of technology life-cycle, learning-by-using appears in the maturity and decline
phases, as it requires a longer utilisation of technology. Learning-by-searching was found to be
only relevant when learning-by-doing does not have an immediate and positive effect in the
technology performance, in an attempt to find technical and scientific solutions. Learning-byinteracting was quite important in the GW operation, especially with the technology developer.
It was also mentioned, during interviews that as there are few microalgae producers in the
market; learning from interacting with other market players is residual. These findings should
be confirmed using other commercial plants as additional case-studies. In the future a KM tool
could be developed with this sort of information that could help managers to orientate learning
processes towards the acceleration of the rate of learning.
