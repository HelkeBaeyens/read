Abstract
Economists investigating consumer demand have accumulated considerable evidence showing that consumers
generally have subjective preferences for characteristics of products and that their demand for products is
significantly affected by their perceptions of the product's attributes. However, the role of farmers' preferences in
adoption decisions have received very limited attention in adoption studies conducted by economists. This paper
tests the hypothesis that farmers' perceptions of technology characteristics significantly affect their adoption
decisions. The analysis, conducted with Tobit models of modern sorghum and rice varietal technologies in Burkina
Paso and Guinea, respectively, strongly supports this hypothesis. Our results provide a strong case for future
adoption studies to expand the range of variables used away from the broad socio-economic, demographic and
institutional factors to include farmers' subjective perceptions of the characteristics of new agricultural technologies.

1. Introduction

The importance of commodity-attribute perceptions has long been of interest to social scientists investigating agricultural t.echnology adoption decisions. Indeed, anthropologists and sociologists have played a lead role in this area and
have argued, using qualitative methods, that
farmers' subjective assessments of agricultural
technologies influence adoption behavior (Kivlin
and Fliegel, 1966, 1967; Nowak, 1992). Economists
have generally lagged behind in investigating this
issue. However, since most earlier works on tech-

nology adoption by economists (O'Mara, 1980)
did not have access to direct observations on
farmers' perceptions, it was not possible to directly and quantitatively test the hypothesis that
perceptions of technology attributes influence
adoption decisions. Instead, variables which affect farmers' access to information, and hence
their perception formation (e.g. extension, education, media exposure, etc.), are typically used in
economic models of the determinants of adoption
decisions (Feder et al., 1985; Shakya and Flinn,
1985; Kebede et al., 1990; Polson and Spencer,
1991; Strauss et al., 1991).

subjective preferences for characteristics of products and that their demand for products is significantly affected by their perceptions of the product's attributes (Jones, 1989; Lin and Milon, 1993).
For example, using a double-hurdle model, Lin
and Milon (1993) found that commodity attributes and consumers' safety perceptions were
significant in explaining decisions to consume and
the frequency of consumption of shellfish in the
USA Similarly, Jones (1989) found, using Cragg's
double-hurdle framework, that consumers' subjective perceptions influenced cigarette smoking
decisions. Economists investigating the adoption
of new agricultural technology have lagged behind in investigating how farmers' (the consumers
of agricultural technologies) subjective perceptions of technology characteristics affect their
adoption decisions. In extensive reviews of adoption studies in developing countries (Feder et al.,
1985; Feder and Umali, 1993), no study was found
to have analyzed the direct effects of farmers'
subjective assessments of agricultural technology
characteristics on adoption decisions. In their recent study, Adesina and Zinnah (1993a) found
that farmers' perceptions of the characteristics of
modern rice varieties significantly affected adoption decisions in Sierra Leone. The paucity of
empirical economic studies on this issue justifies
further investigation. The objective of this paper
is to determine the effects of farmers' perceptions of agricultural technology characteristics on
adoption decisions, using comparative analysis of
two technologies in West Africa (i.e. improved
sorghum varieties in Burkina Faso, and improved
mangrove rice varieties in Guinea).
A historical background of the development of
the new agricultural technologies examined in
this paper is briefly discussed below. Sorghum
improvement activities in West Africa have been
a major focus of research conducted by the International Crops Research Institute for the SemiArid Tropics (ICRISAT) which has the global
mandate for sorghum improvement. ICRISAT's
sorghum improvement work started in Burkina
Faso in 1975/1976. Most of the initial work was
on the screening of introduced and local
germplasm. Breeding started much later. Among
the principal breeding objectives were: good and

stable yield performance under both traditional
and improved soil fertility management conditions and good grain quality, especially for making 'to', a very popular local porridge across the
Sahel (ICRISAT, 1980-1983). As striga-a parasitic weed-has been a major problem facing
sorghum (and, indeed, cereal) farmers in West
Africa, a complementary program on screening
for striga-resistant varieties formed a major part
of ICRISAT's research program (Ramaiah, 1991).
A number of improved varieties was developed
and tested in on-farm tests in Burkina Faso, e.g.
ICSV 1049 BF, ICSV 1002 BF, etc. While farm
tests have been conducted on these varieties in
eastern Burkina Faso (Matlon, 1985; Wildschut
and Ouattara, 1987), little is known about the
factors affecting the adoption decisions of farmers.
Research on the development of mangrove
rice in West Africa is carried out by the West
Africa Rice Development Association (WARDA).
Starting in 1976, WARDA maintained a regional
rice improvement program in Sierra Leone, targeting the approximately 200 000 ha of mangrove
swamps cultivated to rice in West Africa. The
mangrove rice ecologies, located on tidal estuaries that are near the ocean, are important rice
growing environments for six countries in West
Africa: Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Senegal, Gambia,
Sierra Leone and Nigeria. In Guinea, about
64 000 ha of mangrove rice area is under cultivation, representing 12% and 18% of national rice
area and rice production, respectively. Seeds of
the modern varieties (e.g. ROK-5, ROK-10, Kuatik Kundur) were recently diffused to neighboring Guinea (Zinnah et al., 1993). One of the
varieties, ROK-5, has been increasingly adopted.
In the Coyah region (the country's major mangrove swamp rice growing zone), it was estimated
that the percentage of farmers cultivating ROK-5
increased from 1% in 1989 to 15% in 1990
(Adesina and Zinnah, 1993b). On-farm tests conducted from 1982 to 1985 showed that these
modern mangrove rice varieties consistently outyielded the best local varieties by more than 30%
(Agyen-Sampong, 1990). Little is known, however, about the determinants of farmers' adoption of these varieties.

The rest of the paper is divided into three
sections. Section 2 describes the conceptual and
empirical models, while Section 3 discusses the
empirical results. Section 4 presents conclusions
and implications of the results for adoption studies.

2. Methods

A given agricultural technology embodies a
number of important characteristics that may influence adoption decisions. The observed adoption choice on an agricultural technology (e.g.
modern crop varieties) is hypothesized to be the
end result of a complex set of inter-technology
preference comparisons made by farmers. Let the
perceived benefits derived from growing a modern variety and the local variety be represented
by b(m) and b(l), respectively. Let the ith
farmer's perceptions of the varietal-specific characteristics of the modern and local rice varieties
be given by Pim and Pi!, respectively. Let the
other socio-economic and demographic characteristics of farm households affecting the adoption decision be denoted as ci. For simplicity, let
these relations be represented as bmi = q(pim'
pil;c) and bli = w(pim,Pi!;c), respectively. To
model this effect of perceptions of technology
attributes on adoption decisions a Tobit model is
used. This is represented below using an index
function approach

V; • = {3TXi + E;

V;=O if V;*

~0

V;=V;* if V;*>O

(1.1)
(1.2)
(1.3)

where V;, a limited dependent variable, is the
perceived benefit of adoption of the modern variety; V; * is an underlying latent variable that
indexes adoption; X is the vector of socio-economic and demographic characteristics of the
farm household, and the technology perceptions
of the farmer; f3T is a vector of parameters to be
estimated; and E; is an error term. When the
inter-varietal attribute preference comparisons
are such that bmi- bli > 0 (i.e. V; * > 0) the farmer
is observed to adopt the modern variety (V; = V; *

3

> 0). Otherwise, if bmi- bli ~ 0 (or V; * ~ 0) no
adoption is observed (i.e. V; = 0). The model permits the investigation of the decision of whether
or not to adopt and the conditional level of use of
the technology if the initial adoption decision was
made. The Tobit model also has an advantage in
that its coefficients can be further disaggregated
to determine the effect of a change in the ith
variable on changes in the probability of adopting
the modern variety and the expected use intensity
of the variety. Following McDonald and Moffitt
(1980), it can be shown that
E(V;) =<I>(z)E(v;')

(2.1)

where E(v/) is the expected value of V; for
those farmers that have already made the adoption decision, and <I> is the cumulative normal
distribution function at z, where z is X/3 I a.
Differentiating with respect to any element of
X gives

aE( V;) ;ax;= <I>( z) {aE( v;') ;ax;}
+E(v;"){a<I>(z);ax;}

(2.2)

Multiplying through by XJE(V;), the relation
can be converted into elasticity forms

{aE( V;) ;ax;}XJE( V;)
=<I>( z) {aE( v;') jaX;}XJE( V;)
+ E( v;' ){a<I>( z) ;ax;}XJE( V;)

(2.3)

Re-arranging this using Eq. (2.1) gives

{aE( V;) ;ax;}XJE( V;)
= {aE( v;') ;ax;}XJE( v;')

+ {a<I>( z) ;ax;}XJ<I>( z)

(2.4)

The total elasticity consists of two effects: (1)
the change in the probability of the expected
level of use intensity of the modern varieties for
those farmers that are already adopters, and (2)
the change in the elasticity of the probability of
being an adopter.
The empirical models are discussed below. For
the sorghum model, the dependent variable is the
share of the total sorghum area that is cultivated
in improved varieties (ISSHARE), while the dependent variables are, respectively, farmers' subjective assessments of: yield performance

4

(YIELD), the quality of the local porridge (to)
that farmers make from sorghum (TO), performance under poor soil conditions (SOIL), tolerance to striga weed infestation (STRIGA), and
drought tolerance (DROUGHT). It is hypothesized that these factors are positively related to
adoption decisions. In addition to these factors,
the following socio-economic and demographic
variables were included as explanatory variables
in the model: the age of the farmer (AGE),
whether or not the farmer was a village head and
the number of years since becoming village head
(HEAD), participation of the farmer in on-farm
tests of the improved sorghum varieties (TEST),
number of times the farmer was visited by extension agents in the survey year (VISIT), and
the number of times the farmer participated in
extension related workshop training activities
(WKSHOP). It is hypothesized that TEST and
AGE are positively related to adoption decisions.
Testing the varieties in on-farm tests can be expected to influence adoption decisions. The expected sign on AGE is an empirical question: it
may be that older farmers have more experience
in cultivation and are better able to assess the
characteristics of modern technology than
younger farmers. However, it could also be that
older farmers are more risk averse than younger
farmers and have a lesser likelihood of adopting
new technologies. There is no agreement in the
adoption literature on this as the direction of the
effect is generally location or technology specific
(Kebede et al., 1990; Polson and Spencer, 1991).
Based on the innovation-diffusion literature, it is
hypothesized that extension visits (VISIT) and
participation in workshops (WKSHOP) are positively related to adoption by exposing farmers to
'new information'.
For the Guinea model, the dependent variable
is the share of the total mangrove swamp rice
area that is cultivated in improved varieties
(RSHARE). Two classes of explanatory variables
are included in the model. The first set (i.e.
technology perceptions) are farmers' subjective
assessments of the following characteristics of the
rice varieties: yield performance (YIELD), ease
of cooking (COOK), tillering capacity (TILLER),
and ease of threshing (THRESH). The inclusion

of these variables allows us to compare our results with those obtained earlier by Adesina and
Zinnah (1993a) in Sierra Leone. Based on these
results, it is hypothesized that these factors are
positively related to adoption decisions in Guinea.
Ease of cooking is likely to be important to these
rice farmers because of the scarcity of fuel-wood
for preparing food in the mangrove areas. Farmers are obliged to travel several kilometers to
search for fuel-wood. Ease of cooking of rice
varieties is linked to the gelatinization temperature of the rice. Varieties with high gelatinization
temperature take longer periods to cook (Unnevehr, 1986). This increases the demand for
fuel-wood, a very scarce input in the mangrove
environments where most of the mangrove trees
have been cut down by farmers. Thus, farmers
may tend to adopt varieties that puts less pressure on the scarce fuel-wood supply. Tillering
capacity is also very critical in the mangrove
ecology because of the high damage to young rice
seedlings from crabs. Varieties that have the capacity to produce tillers fast, and which reproduce secondary tillers following initial crab damage, are likely to be adopted by farmers. The high
labor demands for manual threshing in this farming system, where labor is the most limiting factor, may create incentives for farmers to adopt
varieties that are easier to thresh. Finally, better
yield performance over local varieties is expected
to positively affect adoption decisions. The other
socio-economic and demographic factors of the
farmer in the model are: age of the farmer (AGE),
the farm size (FSIZE), participation in on-farm
tests (TEST), visit by extension agents (VISIT),
and years of experience in mangrove rice farming
(EXP). The expected signs of these variables follow that discussed above for the Burkina Faso
case. In addition, it is expected that EXP is
positively related to adoption as more experienced farmers may be able to better assess new
technologies.
In each model, the subjective perception variables were defined as dichotomous variables that
take on the value of 1 if the farmer considered
that the new agricultural technology is better
than the local technology for a given technology
attribute, and a value of 0, otherwise. The empiri-

A.A. Adesina, J. Baidu-Forson /Agricultural Economics 13 (1995) 1-9

cal models were estimated using an iterative maximum likelihood algorithm (White, 1978) in order
to obtain asymptotically efficient parameter estimates. The data for the Burkina Faso study were
collected in 1989/1990 from a sample of 57 farmers in the east central region. Data for the Guinea
study were collected in 1990-1991 from a sample
of 110 farmers in the Coyah region.

3. Results
The results for the sorghum model in Burkina
Faso are given in Table 1. The analyses show that
farmers' perceptions of four varietal technology
characteristics were positively related to the
probability of adoption and intensity of cultiva-

tion of the improved sorghum varieties. Significant (at the 5% level) were quality for making
sorghum paste (TO) and performance under poor
soil conditions (SOIL). The coefficient on yield
performance (YIELD) is barely significant at
10%. Farmers' assessment of the relative tolerance of the improved varieties to striga
(STRIGA), though positively related to adoption
decisions, was not significant. The negative sign
on the drought tolerance variable (DROUGHT)
is unexpected and may be due to negative correlation between this variable and other varietal
characteristics not included in the model. Two
farmer characteristics were significant in explaining adoption decisions: the age of the farmer
(AGE) and farmers' participation in on-farm tests
(TEST). The latter variable was the most highly

significant of all the explanatory variables. This is
not unexpected, because extensive sorghum onfarm trials were carried out in the survey area.
The negative sign on WKSHOP is unexpected
and may be explained by the possibility that the
workshops farmers attended were not specifically
on sorghum. Some authors have also argued that
what is important is not this contact with extension but how farmers assess the relevance of the
issues discussed at such farmer workshops for
their actual production decisions (Zinnah et al.,
1993).
These results have implications for sorghum
technology improvement research in West Africa.
First, it shows that yield performance of sorghum
technologies needs to be evaluated by farmers
under their own soil conditions. The results
showed that varieties that farmers judge as having
superior yield performance over local varieties
under on-farm soil fertility conditions tend to be

those that are adopted. Secondly, the analyses
show that sorghum technology development efforts should not only concentrate on agronomic
characteristics. The strong significance of the food
quality variable indicates that farmers are concerned about non-agronomic characteristics. As
sorghum is principally used in West Mrica for
making to, research efforts need to be focused on
screening for lines with appropriate good grain
and food quality for making this local porridge.
One way to ensure this is to have farmers, especially women, assess the food quality of all
sorghum varieties that are proposed for on-farm
testing in West Mrica.
Results for the Guinea model are given in
Table 2. The results show that all the four technology-characteristic perceptions were strongly
significant in explaining farmers' adoption decisions. These results are very similar to those
obtained by Adesina and Zinnah (1993a) in Sierra

Leone. It is also important to note that a nonagronomic trait (ease of cooking) significantly affected farmers' adoption decisions. When taken
together with the results for sorghum in Burkina
Faso, it is clear that farmers consider factors
related to food quality as very critical in adoption
decisions. This suggests that the conventional approach of focusing technology development
mostly on enhanced agronomic characteristics
needs to be changed to also significantly encompass food quality characteristics.
The Guinea results show that none of the
so-called 'contact' variables were significant in
influencing adoption decisions. The lack of significance of the extension variable supports the finding by other researchers that researcher-extension-farmer linkages are extremely weak in
Guinea and that most of the mangrove varieties
currently grown by farmers were obtained via
farmer-farmer contacts (Zinnah et al., 1993).
Comparative analyses of the results in Guinea
and Burkina Faso with the results earlier reported for Sierra Leone by Adesina and Zinnah
(1993a) show some important patterns in the role
of extension and other farmer contact variables in
influencing farmers' adoption decisions. In the
case of mangrove rice varieties in Guinea and
Sierra Leone, extension had very little to do with
technology diffusion: this occurred mainly through
farmers self-experimentation, evaluation, exchange and transfer. In the case of sorghum in
Burkina Faso, extensive on-farm testing of the
varieties in a number of test-villages appears to
have affected adoption decisions. This suggests
that extension workers do not influence technology transfer in all cases. Farmers are also important as sources of technology information and
agents of technology transfer. When farmers assess the characteristics of new technologies and
find them to match their preferences, they often
give the technologies to other farmers to test and
evaluate thereby setting into motion an endogenous process of technology diffusion.
4. Conclusions

The analyses in this paper showed that farmers' subjective preferences for characteristics of

7

new agricultural technologies are very important
determinants of adoption behavior. The results
are robust in that this conclusion is the same for
the two different technologies examined in Burkina Faso and Guinea. The results agree with the
evidence provided by studies of consumer demand showing that consumers critically evaluate
characteristics of a product and that demand is
affected by consumers' subjective assessments of
product attributes (Jones, 1989; Lin and Milon,
1993). Farmers are consumers of the products of
agricultural research and their subjective preferences for characteristics of new agricultural technologies affect their adoption decisions.
Our results, which lend support to the earlier
finding of Adesina and Zinnah (1993a), call for
more theoretical and empirical studies to examine the effects of farmers' subjective preferences
of technology characteristics on adoption decisions. An advantage of the approach we have
used is that it is possible to identify the key
characteristics of technologies that need to be
targeted for improvement if adoption is to be
achieved. Future studies in this area should overcome a limitation of the current analyses: the
data we had did not permit us to measure the
intensity of the perceptions, as was done by Lin
and Milon (1993) in their study of consumer
demand in the USA. We suggest that future
studies collect data that measure not only the
dichotomous comparison of preferences for technology attributes but also the intensity of those
preferences. Another possible limitation of the
current analyses is the possibility of estimation
bias from simultaneity if the perception variables
and the other 'contact' variables (i.e. contact with
extension, participation in on-farm tests etc.) are
endogenous. It was not possible for us to examine
this issue owing to the evidently formidable
econometric problems associated with estimating
simultaneous equation systems with dummy or
other limited dependent variables. Also important is the need for studies to examine non-adoption of new agricultural technologies and how
farmers' subjective preferences for technology attributes play a role (Yapa and Mayfield, 1978;
Nowak, 1992). Nonetheless, our results provide a
strong case for future adoption studies to expand

8

the range of variables used away from the broad
socio-economic, demographic and institutional
factors (Feder et al., 1985; Feder and Umali,
1993), to include farmers' subjective perceptions
of the characteristics of new agricultural technologies.
