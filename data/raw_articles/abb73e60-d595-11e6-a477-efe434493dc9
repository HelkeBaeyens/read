ABSTRACT
Zuhair, S.M.M., Taylor, D.B. and Kramer, R.A., 1992. Choice of utility function form: its
effect on classification of risk preferences and the prediction of farmer decisions. Agric.
Econ., 6: 333-344.
In applications of expected utility analysis, researchers are confronted with a choice
among several utility functional forms. Subjective utility values and probability distributions
for price and yield were elicited from Sri Lankan producers of minor export crops.
Exponential quadratic and cubic utility functions were estimated. The choice of functional
form was found to affect both the classification of risk attitudes and the prediction of
harvesting strategy. The exponential function was the best predictor of harvesting strategy
because it was the best predictor of mature harvesting. All three functions were equally
poor predictors of premature harvesting.

INTRODUCTION

A critical step in many applications of decision analysis under the
expected utility hypothesis is the specification and estimation of a suitable
utility function. For this purpose, several functional forms have been used

in empirical studies (Halter and Dean, 1971; Lin et al., 1974; Lin and
Chang, 1978; Musser et al., 1984). Researchers generally agree that utility
functions should possess some desirable properties such as continuity and
decreasing absolute risk aversion. However, beyond that, there is little
guidance for researchers to use in selecting functional forms. Using data
collected from Sri Lankan farmers, this study first compares the risk
attitudes implied by quadratic, exponential, and cubic utility functions.
Then an investigation is made of whether or not the ranking of prospects is
independent of the utility functional form.
Many studies have arbitrarily chosen a particular functional form and
then proceeded with the analysis. In one evaluation of functional forms,
Lin and Chang (1978) criticized the forms usually employed because all
forms require certain restrictive a priori assumptions. These authors suggested a Box-Cox transformation as a means of determining the form of
the function rather than assuming it. Despite the appeal of this approach,
Buccola (1982a) later demonstrated that the Box-Cox transformation is not
consistent with Bernoullian decision theory.
Musser et al. (1984) have shown that the choice of functional form is
critical because it can affect the classification of decision makers based on
their risk attitudes. Musser et al. (1984) classified twelve graduate students
in their study using the second derivative of the utility function as a
measure of risk aversion. The utility functions used were quadratic (U =a
+ bx- cx 2 ), semi-log (U =a+ b In x), and non-linear (U =a+ bxc). The
quadratic function classified three subjects as risk-preferring and the rest
as risk-indifferent. The semi-log function classified all subjects as riskaverse, and the non-linear function classified all subjects as risk-indifferent.
Regardless of the specific functional form chosen, certain properties are
desirable in a functional form. Important ones include: strictly positive
marginal utility of income, the ease of estimating the parameters of the
function, the ease with which the function can be mathematically manipulated to determine summary measures such as the mean and variance, and
the behavior of the measures of the risk aversion. Ideally, a utility function
also should exhibit decreasing absolute risk aversion with respect to increasing wealth. Of the functional forms suggested in the literature, the
quadratic and the exponential seem to be the most popular.
Analyzing a California farmer's marketing problem, Buccola (1982b),
assuming a normal distribution of returns, reported that quadratic and
exponential functions gave the same optimal portfolio if and only if there
was no more than one linear constraint influencing the decision making
and both functions had the same absolute risk aversion coefficients at the
optimal solution. Hanoch and Levy (1970), in a theoretical comparison of
quadratic and cubic functions, concluded that the cubic function has

CHOICE OF UTILITY FUNCTION FORM

certain properties which are preferred to those of the quadratic function.
These properties are: (1) expected utility depends on the third moment of
the distribution, skewness; (2) this added parameter results in greater
flexibility and better approximates the general utility function; (3) within
certain restrictions on the coefficient, it is monotonically increasing; (4) it
exhibits a decreasing degree of risk aversion at certain intermediate levels;
and (5) it allows for risk preference (convexity) at certain intervals of high
returns. The arguments for the cubic utility function, therefore, rest on the
assumption of non-normal returns or non-zero skewness.
ALTERNATIVE FUNCTIONAL FORMS FOR UTILITY

In all the utility functional forms discussed, U will refer to the utility
index and x to the monetary measure. In this article income will be in Sri
Lankan Rupees (Rs.). At the time of the study, US$1 was equal to 26.28
Rs. The quadratic utility function (ouF) can be represented as:
(1)

U=a +bx +cx 2

where a, b, and c are parameters. If the second derivative of the function,
2c, is less than zero then diminishing marginal utility is implied over the
entire range of x, thus ruling out risk-preferring behavior. If it is positive,
however, the individual would be classified as risk-preferring over the
entire range of income. The Arrow-Pratt absolute risk aversion coefficient,
Ra, for the QUF is given by:
2c

R

(2)

=---

a

b

+ 2cx

Function (2) will remain positive for x < (b j2c). Consequently, within this
range of x, the quadratic function will exhibit increasing risk aversion, and
for values of x > (b j2c), the function will exhibit decreasing risk aversion.
The exponential utility function (EUF) can be represented as:
U = K-

ee -Ax

for K, (), A > 0

(3)

where, K and () are parameters and e is the base of natural logarithms.
The second derivative of the function is:

(4)
implying diminishing marginal utility. The Arrow-Pratt absolute risk aversion coefficient, Ra, is A, which is positive and constant. The exponential
utility function, therefore, exhibits constant risk aversion over all levels of
net returns, which can be argued is one of its major limitations.

336

S.M.M. ZUHAIR ET AL.

The cubic utility function (cuF) can be expressed as:

(5)
U = a + bx + ex 2 + d.x 3
where a, b, c, and d are parameters. The second derivative is given by
2c + 6d.x, the sign of which depends on the sign and the magnitude of the
parameters c, d, and the level of income, x. Thus increasing and decreasing marginal utility are both possible. The Arrow-Pratt absolute risk
aversion coefficient for the cuF is:
Ra = -

[

2c + 6d.x
]
2
b + 2cx + 3d.x

(6)

The Ra thus can be positive or negative depending on the parameter values
and income at which equation (6) is evaluated.
METHODS AND DATA

The data used in this paper were obtained as part of a comprehensive
study of the decision making of Sri Lankan farmers who produce minor
export crops (MEP). The minor export crops considered in this study were
cocoa, coffee, pepper, cardamons, and nutmeg. Several other crops, primarily spices and vegetables, also are referred to as minor export crops in
Sri Lanka, but were not considered in this study. The specific decision
which the study examined was the harvesting behavior of these farmers.
The farmers often harvest their crops prematurely due to fear of theft,
damage by insects, cash needs, and other factors. The study developed
methods to predict whether farmers would harvest maturely or prematurely. One of the methods used elicited utility functions to compare the
income earned from premature harvesting with the income earned in a
future period from mature harvesting.
The data were collected through two farm surveys in the districts of
Kandy and Matale in the central province of Sri Lanka. The surveys were
conducted between December 1985 and February 1986. The sample size of
the first survey was 240, with an equal number from each district. The first
survey was used to collect general information about farms in the two
districts. Using the electoral voters' register as a sampling frame, farm
households were sampled randomly.
A second survey was conducted among 30 farmers selected at random
from the larger sample of 240 farmers. The second survey collected more
detailed information about decision making activities on the farm, with the
chief decision maker as the unit of inquiry. This survey included elicitation
of subjective utility functions and probability distributions.
Direct elicitation of utility functions does have its critics, but direct
elicitation has considerable appeal from an empirical perspective (Robin-

CHOICE OF UTILITY FUNCTION FORM

son et al., 1984). The two most widely used direct elicitation methods for
utility are the Ramsey method and the modified Von Neumann-Morgenstern method (1953). The Ramsey method elicits certainty equivalents for
several risky alternatives. The modified Von Neumann-Morgenstern
method elicits certainty equivalents for a series of lotteries. The modified
Von Neumann-Morgenstern method was deemed appropriate for this
study in view of its ease of use (Anderson et al., 1977) and its proven
effectiveness in Sri Lanka in a previous study (Herath et al., 1982).
Using the modified Von Neumann-Morgenstern method as outlined in
Anderson et al. (1977, p. 72), utility values were elicited for a range of
incomes. This range was established for each individual farmer to correspond to the possible farm income levels which could be experienced by
that farmer. The upper value of the range was the net family income from
farm and off-farm activities reported in the first survey. The lower value of
the range was selected to be a negative 20% of the reported net family
income. A negative value was selected for the lower range to allow utility
estimation over losses as well as gains. Interviews were conducted by
graduate students in agricultural economics at the University of Peradeniya, who were trained in interviewing techniques by the senior author.
Binswanger (1980), in discussing the work of Dillon and Scandizzo (1978),
argued that the elicitation of utility functions can be subject to interviewer
bias. However, since the purpose of this paper is to compare the implications of different functional forms for the information obtained by one
interviewer per farmer, this concern is not relevant to this analysis. That is,
the comparisons in this study are across functional forms for a given farmer
rather than across farmers.
Subjective probability distributions were elicited from 30 growers for
prices and yields of the minor export crops. A modified triangular distribution method was used to elicit 5th, 50th and 95th percentiles of the
distributions (Moskowitz and Bullers, 1979). The shortcomings of this
limited information procedure are recognized (Spetzler and Stael Von
Holstein, 1975), but the method was chosen because of the speed with
which it can be administered. This was an important consideration given
that 20 distributions were elicited from each farmer. Prices and yields were
assessed independently because of the large number of growers and the
small size of Sri Lankan production relative to the world market.
To compare the relative performance of the three utility functions in
predicting behavior, a Monte Carlo simulation model was constructed. The
model simulated net family income from farm and non-farm sources.
Income from minor export crops was treated as stochastic using the elicited
probability distributions of prices and yields. Means and variances were
estimated by formulas given in Anderson et al. (1977), and a truncated

338

S.M.M. ZUHAIR ET AL.

normal distribution was used to generate 1000 random draws for each
minor export crop for each farmer. The truncation was made to assure that
no negative prices or yields were generated. The randomly generated
income levels were then evaluated with the three fitted utility functions to
estimate expected utility levels for the two harvesting options.
UTILITY FUNCTION ESTIMATION

The quadratic (ouF) and cubic functions (cuF) were estimated for each
farmer by applying the method of ordinary least squares while the exponential functions (EUF) were estimated by the method of maximum likelihood. For the exponential functions, a set of parameters (K, e, and A) was
determined for each function which minimized the sum of squares of the
error terms. These estimates were used as the starting values in the
maximum likelihood method. Space limitations preclude presentation of
the estimated functions. The reader is referred to Zuhair (1986) for
additional details on the estimation.
For the EUF, estimates of the Arrow-Pratt risk aversion coefficient, A,
were significant at least at the 0.05 level for all the farmers. For the QUF
and cuF, the risk aversion coefficients are non-linear functions of the utility
function's parameters; thus determination of the level of significance of the
risk aversion coefficients for these functions was not possible.
For the QUF, the adjusted-R 2 ranged from 0.80 to 0.99. With the
exception of one farmer's QUF, which was significant at 0.01 level, all the
other farmers' QUFS were significant at the 0.001 level, based on an F-test.
For the cuF, the adjusted-R 2 ranged from 0.86 to 0.99. Based on an F-test,
the cuFs were significant at the 0.01 level for four farmers and at 0.001 for
the rest of the farmers. For the EUF, the adjusted-R 2 ranged from 0.86 to
0.99. Comparing the adjusted-R 2 across functions, the cuF gave the highest
adjusted-R 2 for 14 farmers, the EUF for three farmers and the QUF for two
farmers. For four farmers, all three functions gave the same adjusted-R 2 .
Four farmers had the same adjusted-R 2 for the cuF and EUF, which was
higher than for their QUF. The QUF and the cuF were tied for highest
adjusted-R 2 for two farmers, while the QUF and the EUF had the same
higher adjusted-R 2 than the cuF for the remaining farmer.
FARMER RISK ATTITUDES

The Arrow-Pratt risk aversion coefficient, Ra, was computed for each
farmer. The Ra, when computed with the EUF is independent of the level of
income, while for the QUF and the cuF the Ra is a function of income. The
Ra was computed at the midpoints of the income ranges used to elicit the
utility functions (Table 1).

Ra > 0 means that the farmer is risk-averse at this level of income, while Ra < 0 means that
the farmer is risk-preferring. The risk aversion coefficients were calculated for the quadratic
and cubic functions at the midpoints of the ranges used for each farmer to elicit his utility
function. For the exponential function, Ra is independent of the level of income.

The EUF classified all farmers as risk-averse, Ra > 0. The Ra, as given by
..\., ranged from 0.00001611 (farmer 8) to 0.00356840 (farmer 21). The QUF
classified 27 farmers as risk-averse and three farmers as risk preferring at
the income midpoint. For the risk-averse farmers, the Ra ranged from
0.00000551 (farmer 8) to 0.00407888 (farmer 21). The risk-averse farmers
with the lowest and the highest Ra with the QUF at the income midpoint

340

also had the lowest and highest Ra with the EUF. For farmers classified as
risk preferring by the QUF, the Ra at the income midpoint ranged from
- 0.00044156 (farmer 9) to -0.000050530 (farmer 25).
At the income midpoint, the cuF classified 15 farmers as risk-averse and
15 farmers as risk-preferring. The Ra for risk-averse farmers ranged from
0.0000006 (farmer 8) to 0.0009055 (farmer 26). Note that farmer number 8
had the lowest level of risk aversion with all three functions. For the
risk-preferring farmers, the Ra ranged from -0.0000130 (farmer 14) to
-0.0019286 (farmer 30). The three farmers classified as risk-preferring by
the QUF were also classified as risk-preferring by the cuF at their income
midpoint. Twelve of the farmers who were classified as risk-averse by the
QUF were classified as risk-preferring by the cuF.
PREFERRED HARVESTING STRATEGIES

Table 2 gives indices of expected utility for the three utility functions
analyzed with respect to income which could be earned from mature and
premature harvesting decisions. The estimated utility functions were used
to compute the expected utility of income under two harvesting strategies,
mature harvesting (M) and premature harvesting (P). The income distribution from each alternative was computed using a Monte Carlo simulation
model which sampled prices and yields from elicited subjective probability
distributions (Zuhair, 1986). The expected income generated by the Monte
Carlo simulation fell within the income range used to elicit the utility
function for all but two farmers. In these two cases, the expected income
levels were less than 10 percent above the upper limit of the range. The
income range used to elicit the certainty equivalents for estimation of the
utility functions thus was comparable with the income resulting from the
Monte Carlo simulations.
For the EUF, the utility index for Strategy-M was higher than that of
Strategy-P for 29 farmers. The QUF ranked Strategy-M higher for 25
farmers and lower for five farmers. The cuF ranked Strategy-M higher for
21 farmers and lower for nine farmers. The cuF, thus, favored the premature harvesting strategy for the largest number of farmers.
These results demonstrate that different utility functional forms can
have a different preference ordering for the same set of prospects. Comparing the EUF and the QUF, four reversals in ranking of the prospects are
observed. Between the EUF and cuF there are eight reversals in ranking,
and between the QUF and cuF, six reversals occurred.
The ultimate test of functional form is how well the function predicts
actual farmer behavior. In Table 3, 1985 observed farmer behavior is
compared to the predicted behavior with respect to the mature versus

premature harvesting. For each utility function, the farmer's expected
income from mature and premature harvesting of the MEC was employed
(Zuhair, 1986). The EUF, with 23 correct predictions, did the best job of
predicting actual behavior. The QUF was second with 19 correct predictions,
while the cuF was last with 15 correct predictions. With only one correct
prediction of premature harvesting by each utility function, all three
functions did a better job of predicting mature harvesting than premature
harvesting. That predictions were better for mature harvesting may, at least

in part, be due to the sample containing only eight actual premature
harvesters. Alternatively, since these three utility functions did not correctly predict behavior for seven of the premature harvesters, perhaps

CHOICE OF UTILITY FUNCTION FORM

343

some other form of utility function would be more appropriate for these
individuals.
It should be noted that a stronger test of these utility functions would
have been to compare them to observed behavior in subsequent years since
the predicted behavior represents a long term average behavior determined
from the results of the Monte Carlo simulation. This test, however, was
beyond the scope of the study.
CONCLUSIONS

This study has demonstrated that the choice of a utility function is an
important aspect of the methodology of applying expected utility theory.
The importance of choosing an appropriate utility function cannot be over
emphasized. Depending on the functional form chosen by the researcher,
farmers may be classified as risk averse or risk preferring. In contrast to the
exponential utility function which imposes risk aversion on all farmers, the
quadratic utility function classified 27 farmers as risk-averse and three as
risk-preferring, while the cubic utility function classified half of the farmers
as risk-averse and half as risk-preferring.
In addition to the risk attitudes classification issue, this study explored
the effects of utility functional form on the ranking of risky prospects. It
was found that there were numerous preference reversals when different
functional forms were used to evaluate mature versus premature harvesting
strategies. This study examined the simple choice of either mature or
premature harvesting. The large number of preference reversals suggests
that if the analysis was extended to the more complicated case of portfolio
selection, portfolios also would be sensitive to choice of functional form.
In this study, the EUF performed better than other functions in predicting overall farmer behavior, but more research is needed to better predict
premature harvesting behavior. The results do not suggest that the EUF will
be the appropriate function in all cases. Rather, the results of this study
suggest that when employing a utility function, several functions must be
estimated and evaluated in terms of their power to predict actual situations. Only then can an appropriate function for further analysis be
selected. Furthermore, it should be noted that since an individual's preferences and the utility function which will accurately reflect these preferences are unique to each individual, it is not likely that one form of utility
function will correctly predict the behavior of all individuals. At best, a
utility function which predicts behavior correctly for most individuals, such
as the EUF in this study, may be identifiable.
